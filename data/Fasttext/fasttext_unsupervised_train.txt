so if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits if it’s unobserved it will however if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target it will not have gone through both slits
there’s no point i just think it’s a good idea for a teeshirt
one across is aegean eight down is nabakov twentysix across is mcm fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum which makes fourteen across portauprince see papa doc’s capital idea that’s portauprince haiti
yes um is this the high iq sperm bank
if you have to ask maybe you shouldn’t be here
i think this is the place
oh take your time i’ll just finish my crossword puzzle oh wait
leonard i don’t think i can do this
what are you kidding you’re a semipro
no we are committing genetic fraud there’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high iq offspring think about that i have a sister with the same basic dna mix who hostesses at fuddruckers
sheldon this was your idea a little extra money to get fractional t1 bandwidth in the apartment
i know and i do yearn for faster downloads but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve
i’m sure she’ll still love him
well what do you want to do
i don’t know i’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before
are you still mad about the sperm bank
you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs
if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres most people will trip
i don’t care two millimetres that doesn’t seem right
no it’s true i did a series of experiments when i was twelve my father broke his clavicle
is that why they sent you to boarding school
no that was the result of my work with lasers
significant improvement over the old neighbour
two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition yes she is
we don’t mean to interrupt we live across the hall
oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate heterosexual bedrooms
oh okay well guess i’m your new neighbour penny
hi well uh oh welcome to the building
thankyou maybe we can have coffee sometime
should we have invited her for lunch
no we’re going to start season two of battlestar galactica
we already watched the season two dvds
i think we should be good neighbours invite her over make her feel welcome
well then that was wrong of us we need to widen our circle
i have a very wide circle i have 212 friends on myspace
yes and you’ve never met one of them
i’m going to invite her over we’ll have a nice meal and chat
chat we don’t chat at least not offline
well it’s not difficult you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response
anyway um we brought home indian food and um i know that moving can be stressful and i find that when i’m undergoing stress that good food and company can have a comforting effect also curry is a natural laxative and i don’t have to tell you that uh a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about
leonard i’m not expert here but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements
oh you’re inviting me over to eat
oh that’s so nice i’d love to
so what do you guys do for fun around here
well today we tried masturbating for money
okay well make yourself at home
this looks like some serious stuff leonard did you do this
yeah well it’s just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges that part there that’s just a joke it’s a spoof of the bourneoppenheimer approximation
so you’re like one of those beautiful mind genius guys
i have a board if you like boards this is my board
if by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at mit sure
oh come on who hasn’t seen this differential below “here i sit broken hearted”
at least i didn’t have to invent twentysix dimensions just to make the math come out
i didn’t invent them they’re there
in all of them that is the point
uh do you guys mind if i start
um penny that’s where i sit
in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration in the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct thus discouraging conversation nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion i could go on but i think i’ve made my point
do you want me to move
fine wanders in circles looking lost
well this is nice we don’t have a lot of company over
that’s not true koothrapali and wolowitz come over all the time
tuesday night we played klingon boggle until one in the morning
i resent you saying we don’t have company
yeah it’s like regular boggle but in klingon that’s probably enough about us tell us about you
um me okay i’m sagittarius which probably tells you way more than you need to know
yes it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality
i think what sheldon’s trying to say is that sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess
oh yeah a lot of people think i’m a water sign okay let’s see what else oh i’m a vegetarian oh except for fish and the occasional steak i love steak
that’s interesting leonard can’t process corn
wuuh do you have some sort of a job
oh yeah i’m a waitress at the cheesecake factory
i don’t eat it i just think it’s a good idea
oh anyways i’m also writing a screenplay it’s about this sensitive girl who comes to la from lincoln nebraska to be an actress and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory
so it’s based on your life
well if that was a movie i would go see it
i know right okay let’s see what else um that’s about it that’s the story of penny
it was until i fell in love with a jerk
oh god you know four years i lived with him four years that’s like as long as high school
it took you four years to get through high school
i just i can’t believe i trusted him
should i say something i feel like i should say something
you no you’ll only make it worse
you want to know the most pathetic part even though i hate his lying cheating guts i still love him is that crazy
no it’s not crazy it’s uh uh it’s a paradox and paradoxes are part of nature think about light now if you look at huygens light is a wave as confirmed by the double slit experiments but then along comes albert einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too well i didn’t make it worse
oh i’m so sorry i’m such a mess and on top of everything else i’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work
really would it be totally weird if i used it
thanks you guys are really sweet
well this is an interesting development
it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment
that’s not true remember at thanksgiving my grandmother with alzheimer’s had that episode
point taken it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out
the worst part was watching her carve that turkey
so what exactly are you trying to accomplish here
that woman in there’s not going to have sex with you
well i’m not trying to have sex with her
oh good then you won’t be disappointed
what makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me i’m a male and she’s a female
yes but not of the same species
i’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here i’m just trying to be a good neighbour
that’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldn’t participate however briefly
do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your luke skywalker nomoretears shampoo
it’s darth vader shampoo there is a knock on the door luke skywalker’s the conditioner
it’s a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974
this is not a good time
it’s before he became a creepy computer voice
that’s great you guys have to go
it’s just not a good time
yeah right your grandmother back in town
no and she’s not a lady she’s just a new neighbour
hang on there really is a lady here
and you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus
can we please stop saying coitus
technically that would be coitus interruptus
hey is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower oh hi sorry hello
enchante madamoiselle howard wolowitz caltech department of applied physics you may be familiar with some of my work it’s currently orbiting jupiter’s largest moon taking highresolution digital photographs
penny i work at the cheesecake factory
come on i’ll show you the trick with the shower
it’s french for good shower it’s a sentiment i can express in six languages
save it for your blog howard
uh there it goes it sticks i’m sorry
you’re welcome oh you’re going to step right okay i’ll…
um okay can i ask you a favour
a favour sure you can ask me a favour i would do you a favour for you
it’s okay if you say no
it’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met
i really think we should examine the chain of causality here
event a a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower event b we drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s exboyfriend query on what plane of existence is there even a semirational link between these events
she asked me to do her a favour sheldon
ah yes well that may be the proximal cause of our journey but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause
that’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come
oh right yes i could have stayed behind and watched wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian arabic and farsi why can’t she get her own tv
come on you know how it is with breakups
no i don’t and neither do you
wuh i i broke up with joyce kim
you did not break up with joyce kim she defected to north korea
to mend her broken heart this situation is much less complicated there’s some kind of dispute between penny and her exboyfriend as to who gets custody of the tv she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him
so we get to have a scene with him
no sheldon there’s not going to be a scene there’s two of us and one of him
leonard the two of us can’t even carry a tv
so you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university
uh i’m sorry do you speak english
oh he speaks english he just can’t speak to women
he’s kind of a nerd juice box
hi i’m leonard this is sheldon
what did i just… uh we’re here to pick up penny’s tv
we’re not going to give up just like that
leonard the tv is in the building we’ve been denied access to the building ergo we are done
excuse me if i were to give up at the first little hitch i never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang
it’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work
come on we have a combined iq of 360 we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building
what do you think their combined iq is
this is it knocks i’ll do the talking
good thinking i’ll just be the muscle
how the hell did you get in the building
my mom bought me those pants
you’re going to have to call her
sheldon i’m so sorry i dragged you through this
it’s okay it wasn’t my first pantsing and it won’t be my last
and you were right about my motives i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny that might have some day led to sex
well you got me out of my pants
anyway i’ve learned my lesson she’s out of my league i’m done with her i’ve got my work one day i’ll win the nobel prize and then i’ll die alone
don’t think like that you’re not going to die alone
thank you sheldon you’re a good friend
and you’re certainly not going to win a nobel prize
this is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest they have a great house ale
yeah i’ve had him since level ten his name is buttons anyway if you had your own game character we could hang out maybe go on a quest
oh i don’t think i’ll be able to stop thinking about it
well your exboyfriend sends his regards and i think the rest is fairly selfexplanatory
i’m so sorry i really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass
no it was a valid hypothesis
that was a valid hypothesis what is happening to you
really thank you so much for going and trying you’re uh you’re so terrific why don’t you put some clothes on i’ll get my purse and dinner is on me okay
thank you you’re not done with her are you
our babies will be smart and beautiful
is thai food okay with you penny
we can’t have thai food we had indian for lunch
they would be gastronomically redundant i can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl
any ideas raj he just looks at her with a worried expression
turn left on lake street and head up to colorado i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke
baby baby don’t get hooked on me uh baby baby don’t get hooked on me
i don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as far as the population of this car goes you’re a veritable mack daddy
there you go pad thai no peanuts
but does it have peanut oil
uh i’m not sure everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up
since it’s not bee season you can have my epinephrine
you don’t need chopsticks this is thai food
thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth
ask him for a napkin i dare you there is a knock on the door i’ll get it
do i look puffy i feel puffy
no no look at my fingers they’re like vienna sausages
they’re not going anywhere closes door staying in hallway so you’re coming home from work that’s great how was work
well you know it’s the cheesecake factory people order cheesecake and i bring it to them
so you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system
yeah call it whatever you want i get minimum wage yeah anyways i was wondering if you could help me out with something i was…
oh okay great i’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow and i may not be here so… apartment door opens sheldon raj and howard appear oh hel…hello
haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless russian
yeah i probably won’t but… hey sheldon
hey raj raj looks uncomfortable still not talking to me huh
don’t take it personally it’s his pathology he can’t talk to women
he can’t talk to attractive women or in your case a cheesecake–scented goddess
so there’s gonna be some furniture delivered
yeah yeah if it gets here and i’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment
great here’s my spare key thank you
um if you don’t have any other plans do you want to join us for thai food and a superman movie marathon
a marathon wow how many superman movies are there
yeah i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter and superman swooshes down and catches her which one was that
you realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy
yes i know men can’t fly
oh no let’s assume that they can lois lane is falling accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel miss lane who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces
unless superman matches her speed and decelerates
in what space sir in what space she’s two feet above the ground frankly if he really loved her he’d let her hit the pavement it would be a more merciful death
excuse me your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that superman’s flight is a feat of strength
are you listening to yourself it is well established that superman’s flight is a feat of strength it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings an ability he derives from earth’s yellow sun
yeah and you don’t have a problem with that how does he fly at night
uh a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells
i’m just going to go wash up
i have 26 hundred comic books in there i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells
challenge accepted tries door we’re locked out
okay her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to delivery man leaves oh you’re just going to be done okay cool thanks i guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves
well we don’t have a dolly or lifting belts or any measurable upper body strength
we don’t need strength we’re physicists we are the intellectual descendents of archimedes give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth it’s just a matter… starts to move package i don’t have this… i don’t have this i don’t have this
yes but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring
easy easy package falls okay now we’ve got an inclined plane the force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs call it thirty degrees so about half
exactly half let’s push okay see it’s moving this is easy all in the math
what’s your formula for the corner
what oh okay uh okay yeah no problem just come up here and help me pull and turn
ah gravity thou art a heartless bitch
you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman
men do things for women without expecting sex
yeah those are men who just had sex
i’m doing this to be a good neighbour in any case there’s no way it could lower the odds
almost there almost there almost there lets go of package it starts to slip down
no we’re not no we’re not no we’re not
watch your fingers watch your fingers oh god my fingers
no it hurt… looking around great caesar’s ghost look at this place
a little messy the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy this is chaos excuse me explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid i’m just inferring that this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale
did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort organise and label the entire world around them
well they don’t hard as it may be for you to believe most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content
excuse me but i think we’ve both found that helpful at times
sheldon this is not your home
this is not anyone’s home this is a swirling vortex of entropy
when the transvestite lived here you didn’t care how he kept the place
because it was immaculate i mean you open that man’s closet it was left to right evening gowns cocktail dresses then his police uniforms
what were you doing in his closet
i helped run some cable for a webcam
oh hey penny this just arrived we just brought this up just now
great was it hard getting it up the stairs
well we’ll get out of your hair
oh great thank you again she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa
penny i just want you to know that you don’t have to live like this i’m here for you
yeah he didn’t tell it right
are you insane you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean
i had no choice i couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room and just outside our living room was that hallway and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this
do you realise that if penny wakes up there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here
i just gave you a reasonable explanation
no no you gave me an explanation it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers
don’t be ridiculous i have no peers
sheldon we have to get out of here
you might want to speak in a lower register
evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby if you want to avoid waking her speak in a lower register
no lowering his voice dramatically that’s ridiculous
fine i accept your premise now please let’s go
i am not leaving until i’m done
if you have time to lean you have time to clean
i have to say i slept splendidly granted not long but just deeply and well
i’m not surprised a well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean
granted my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny’s quality of life
you know what you’ve convinced me maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet
you don’t think that crosses a line
yes for god’s sake sheldon do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth
no i do not have a sarcasm sign
do you want some cereal i’m feeling so good today i’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf hello honey puffs
how did she know it was us
i may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet
god this is going to be bad
goodbye honey puffs hello big bran
you came into my apartment last night when i was sleeping
really more to organise you’re not actually dirty per se
do you understand how creepy this is
oh yes we discussed it at length last night
in my apartment while i was sleeping
and snoring and that’s probably just a sinus infection but it could be sleep apnoea you might want to see an otolaryngologist it’s a throat doctor
and what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses
depending on the depth that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon leonard holds up a sign reading “sarcasm” oh
okay look no penny i think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less for lack of a better word violated maybe we could talk about this some more
sure that’s another way to go
penny penny just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm penny stares in disbelief then leaves well that was a little nonresponsive
you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise sheldon laughs what’s funny
wooh boy you are all over the place this morning knocks on penny’s door i have a masters and two phd’s i should not have to do this
i am truly sorry for what happened last night i take full responsibility and i hope that it won’t colour your opinion of leonard who is not only a wonderful guy but also i hear a gentle and thorough lover penny closes door in his face i did what i could
hey raj raj stands looking uncomfortable hey listen i don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with leonard and sheldon but i’m really upset about it i mean they just they let themselves into my place and then they cleaned it i mean can you even believe that how weird is that
ooh she’s standing very close to me oh my she does smell good what is that vanilla
you know where i come from someone comes into your house at night you shoot okay and you don’t shoot to wound i mean alright my sister shot her husband but it was an accident they were drunk what was i saying
she’s so chatty maybe my parents are right maybe i’d be better off with an indian girl we’d have the same cultural background and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me
it’s obvious that they meant well but i’m just i’m having a really rough time like i said i broke up with my boyfriend and it’s just freaking me out
i mean just because most of the men i’ve known in my life happen to be jerks doesn’t mean i should just assume leonard and sheldon are right
she asked me a question i should probably nod does
that’s exactly what i thought thank you for listening you’re a doll she hugs him
grab a napkin homie you just got served
his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him
hello sorry i’m late but i was in the hallway chatting up penny
really you rajesh koothrapali spoke to penny
actually i was less the chatter than the chattee
what did she say is she still mad at me
well she was upset at first but probably because her sister shot somebody then there was something about you and… then she hugged me
she hugged you how did she hug you raj hugs howard is that her perfume i smell
um here’s the thing reads from note penny just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb so too i regret my participation in what was at the very least an error in judgement the hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes some mistakes such as madame curie’s discovery of radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow painful death from radiation poisoning another example from the field of ebola research…
we’re okay kisses him on cheek closes door leonard looks happy walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door
guys seriously i grew up on a farm okay i rebuilt a tractor engine when i was like twelve i think i can put together a cheap swedish media centre
no please we insist it’s the least we can do considering
considering what how great this place looks
oh boy i was afraid of this
these instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components this right here is why sweden has no space program
well uh it looked pretty good in the store
it is an inefficient design for example penny has a flat screen tv which means all the space behind it is wasted
we could put her stereo back there
run an infrared repeater photocell here emitter here easy peasy
good point how you gonna cool it
hang on penny how about fans here and here
also inefficient and might be loud
how about liquid coolant maybe a little aquarium pump here run some quarter inch pvc…
guys this is actually really simple
hold on honey men at work the pvc comes down here maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here
oh really show me where we put a drip tray a sluice and an overflow reservoir
and if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing
guys it’s hot in here i think i’ll just take off all my clothes
oh i’ve got it how about if we replace panels a b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium
right then the entire thing’s one big heat sink
perfect leonard why don’t you and sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium raj and i will run down to my lab and get the oxyacetaline torch
meet back here in an hour
okay this place does look pretty good
alright just a few more feet and… here we are gentlemen the gates of elzebub
don’t panic this is what the last 97 hours have been about
stay frosty there’s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the sword of azeroth
warriors unsheathe your weapons magic wielders raise your wands
blowing the gates control shift b oh my god so many goblins
don’t just stand there slash and move slash and move
leonard you’ve got one on your tail
that’s alright my tail’s prehensile i’ll swat him off
i’ve got him leonard tonight i spice my meat with goblin blood
raj no it’s a trap they’re flanking us
sheldon he’s got raj use your sleath spell sheldon sheldon
i’ve got the sword of azeroth
forget the sword sheldon help raj
there is no more sheldon i am the swordmaster
he’s selling the sword of azeroth on ebay
you betrayed us for money who are you
i’m a rogue knight elf don’t you people read character descriptions wait wait wait somebody just clicked “buy it now”
wooh i’m all sweaty anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming i just built a virtual pool
no i can’t look at you or your avatar right now
don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her
oh right right right right right
stealing snail mail very old school i like it
penny the mailman did it again he… looks up to see penny kissing a hunky man oh sorry
um no hi leonard this is doug doug this is my neighbour leonard
uh yeah uh i just i got your mail again here
thank you i’ve got to talk to that mailman
oh no that’s probably not such a good idea civil servants have a documented propensity to you know snap
no problem bye oh and bye bro returns to apartment
no i’m fine penny’s fine the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…
kissing what kind of kissing cheeks lips chaste french
please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy
no i’m not jealous i’m just a little concerned for her i didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with
because he looked better than you
well at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again
i disagree love is not a sprint it’s a marathon a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms or hits you with the pepper spray
well i’m done with penny i’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed
the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye
well i don’t think you have a shot there i have noticed that lesley winkle recently started shaving her legs now given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability
i don’t know you guys work in the same lab
there are pitfalls trust me i know when it comes to sexual harassment law i’m… a bit of a selftaught expert
look howard if i were to ask lesley winkle out it would just be for dinner i’m not going to walk into the lab ask her to strip naked and dance for me
lesley i would like to propose an experiment
right lesley i would like to propose an experiment
hang on i’m trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o’ noodles
pfff i’ve done it about two seconds 26 for minestrone anyway i was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a neurochemical overlay
wait are you asking me out
i was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleaguefriendship paradigm with the addition of a datelike component but we don’t need to quibble over terminology
what sort of experiment would you propose
there is a generally accepted pattern in this area i would pick you up take you to a restaurant then we would see a movie probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock
interesting and would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the biochemical reaction during the goodnight kiss
well why don’t we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable
can you define the parameters of the kiss
thank you takes mint shall i count down from three
no i think it needs to be spontaneous
you proposed the experiment i think you should present your findings first
fair enough on the plus side it was a good kiss reasonable technique no extraneous spittle on the other hand no arousal
ah well thank you for your time
sheldon if you were a robot and i knew and you didn’t would you want me to tell you
that depends when i learn that i’m a robot will i be able to handle it
maybe although the history of sciencefiction is not on your side
uh let me ask you this when i learn that i’m a robot would i be bound by asimov’s three laws of robotics
you might be bound by them right now
that’s true have you ever harmed a human being or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm
have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered
the internet’s been down for half an hour
also sheldon may be a robot
so how did it go with lesley
oh we tried kissing but the earth didn’t move i mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway
oh i’ve seen that look before this is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats i don’t know if i can take it
well as usual wolowitz has the solution i happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women and leonard could have his pick
i think mrs tishman’s got her eye on you i’ve been there you’re in for a treat
you don’t know me you don’t wear my chains… god that’s a good song
if you’re compiling a mix cd for a double suicide leonard is taking supplies out of a bag oh i hope that scratching post is for you
i know what you’re thinking i’ve taken your asthma into account there’s a feline geneticist in san diego who has developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos
i’ve been thinking about names i’m kind of torn between einstein newton and sergeant fuzzyboots
leonard do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat
maybe if it’s a cute little cuddly cat
oh come on leonard this is obviously about penny
it doesn’t matter the woman’s not interested in me the woman rejected me
okay look i think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker nevertheless i do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you you did not ask her out
you’re right i didn’t ask her out i should ask her out
no no now that was not my point my point was don’t buy a cat
no but you’re right i should march over there and ask her out
oh goody we’re getting a cat
good afternoon penny so hi hey uh… i was wondering if you had plans for dinner
uh do you mean dinner tonight
there is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed so to clarify here by dinner i mean supper
or dinner i was thinking six thirty if you can go or a different time
yeah i like hanging out with you guys
you know sheldon howard raj who all’s coming
they… might all be there or a subset of them might be there uh algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns for example sheldon had quizznos for lunch sometimes he finds that filling other times he doesn’t it’s no fault of quizznos they have a varied menu
okay whatever it sounds like fun
great did we say a time
and that’s still good for you
cos it’s not carved in stone
to… carve the… okay i’ll see you six thirty
can you tell i’m perspiring a little
no the dark crescentshaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely what time is your date
perfect that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate
not if you’re a rugby team
by the way if it should ever come up you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quizznos
no reason oh you know what maybe this isn’t such a good idea
oh no no no well now there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening
you’re right alcohol poor judgement it could go well
of course there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code
you could have stopped at “it could go well”
if i could of i would of
i mean i’m a perfectly nice guy there’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner maybe take a walk afterwards talk about things we have in common “you love pottery i love pottery” you know there’s a pause we both know what’s happening i lean in we kiss it’s a little tentative at first but then i realise she’s kissing me back and she’s biting my lower lip you know she wants me this thing is going the distance we’re going to have sex oh god oh my god
oh okay well then calm down
if i could calm down i wouldn’t be having a panic attack that’s why they call it a panic attack
alright alright well just sit down yes sit down now close your eyes
now try to increase your alphawave activity
it’s a biofeedback technique it’s relaxation through brainwave manipulation i read a paper about it in the journal of american neuroscience it was a little sparsely sourced but i think the basic science is valid i probably have it here somewhere
oh who am i kidding i can’t go through with this you need to call her and cancel
i don’t know tell her i’m sick
not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if i want to try this again
got it so i’m assuming nothing venereal i’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back
but i thought you wanted to cancel
i can’t because if i don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you
why would she be expecting me
stop asking me all these questions i need to take another shower
so are the rest of the guys meeting us here
oh yeah no turns out that raj and howard had to work and sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet
ooh my uncle just had a colonoscopy
you’re kidding well then that’s something we have in common
we both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud
so what’s new in the world of physics
well with the exception of string theory not much has happened since the 1930’s and you can’t prove string theory at best you can say “hey look my idea has an internal logical consistency”
ah well i’m sure things will pick up
what’s new at the cheesecake factory
oh uh not much we do have a chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well
good good and what about your uh hallway friend
doug oh yeah i dunno i mean he’s nice and funny but…
can i get you started with some drinks
no waves her away you were saying but…
just say the but thing about doug and then i’ll get her back
okay well you know it’s just me i’m still getting over this breakup with kurt and this thing with doug would be just rebound sex
ugh don’t get me started on rebound sex
it’s just it’s my pattern i break up then i find some cute guy and then it’s just thirty six meaningless of… well you know
i’m not sure that i do um is that one thirtysix hour experience or is it thirty six hours spread out over say one… glorious summer
no it’s usually over a weekend and trust me you do not feel good after it
of course yeah emotional chafing hey do you want to see something cool penny nods i can make this olive go into this glass without touching it
physics he places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side
actually it’s centripetal force which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive the olive drops excuse me leonard disappears under tablenow if you were riding on the olive you’d be in a noninertial reference frame and would he bangs his head on the underside of the table
yeah i’m okay did you spill ketchup
are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room
no no i’m okay it’s stopped bleeding
i know but you did throw up isn’t that a sign of a concussion
yes but i get car sick too so…
sorry about your car by the way
oh no it’s fine you got most of it out the window
the poor guy on the bike i had a nice time
yeah me too um good night leonard turns across hallway leonard
was this supposed to be a date
this no no of course not this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up because of work and a colonoscopy
when i take a girl out on a date and i do she knows she’s been dated capital d bold face underline like dayted i think i might have a little concussion i’m going to go lay down for a while good night
score one for liquor and poor judgement
i’ve been thinking about time travel again
why did you hit a roadblock with invisibility
put it on the back burner anyway it occurs to me if i ever did perfect a time machine i’d just go into the past and give it to myself thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place
yeah it really takes the pressure off
sounds like a breakthrough should i call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover exiting the apartment
it’s time travel leonard i will have already done that
then i guess congratulations are in order
no congratulations will have been in order you know i’m not going to enjoy this party
i know i’m familiar with you
at the last department party dr finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes
you know what’s interesting about caves leonard
well then we’ll avoid finkleday we’ll meet the new department head congratulate him shake his hand and go
how’s this pleased to meet you dr gablehouser how fortunate for you that the university has chosen to hire you despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement mahalo
do you know there are only eight consonants in the hawaiian language
interesting you should lead with that
oh god look at this buffet i love america
you don’t have buffets in india
of course but it’s all indian food you can’t find a bagel in mumbai to save your life schmear me
well here’s an interesting turn of events
what sees howard entering with a statuesque blonde howard brought a date
a more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward
hey what up science bitches may i introduce my special lady friend summer puts arm around her
i already told you touching’s extra
here comes our new boss be polite
howard nice to meet you and you are
an actual real scientist to leonard how was that
i can’t believe he fired me
well you did call him a glorified highschool science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts
in my defence i prefaced that by saying “with all due respect”
this isn’t breakfast it’s an experiment
huh cos it looks a lot like breakfast
i finally have the time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins and its impact visavis taste
sounds yummy i look forward to your work with bacon
you know i’m sure if you just apologised to gablehauser he would give you your job back
i don’t want my job back i’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations before that i spent four years working on my thesis before that i was in college and before that i was in the fifth grade this is my first day off in decades and i’m going to savour it
okay i’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs
i’m not just fixing my eggs i’m fixing everyone’s eggs
use new eggs there is a knock on the door
hi hey i’m running out to the market do you guys need anything
oh well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence
i need eggs four dozen should suffice
yes and evenly distributed amongst brown white free range large extralarge and jumbo
never mind you won’t get it right i’d better come with you
how come you didn’t go into work today
i’m taking a sabbatical because i won’t kowtow to mediocre minds
theoretical physicists do not get canned but yeah
well maybe it’s all for the best you know i always say when one door closes another one opens
no it doesn’t not unless the two doors are connected by relays or there are motion sensors involved
or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door
slow down slow down please slow down
look you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars
no no let me do the math for you this car weighs let’s say 4000lb now add say 140 for me 120 for you
oh i’m sorry did i insult you is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth
interesting anyway that gives us a total weight of let’s say 4400lb
fine we’re travelling forward at good lord 51 miles an hour now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned still by the time we come to a stop we’ll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death mutilation and… oh look they built a new putput course
this is great look at me out in the real world of ordinary people just living their ordinary colourless workaday lives
no thank you and thank you ordinary person hey you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes
uh no no not really listen didn’t you say you needed some eggs
uh yes but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket
oh okay well maybe you should start heading on out then
no this is fun oh the thing about tomatoes and i think you’ll really enjoy this is they’re shelved with the vegetables but they’re technically a fruit
no i mean what you find enjoyable
well there’s some value to taking a multivitamin but the human body can only absorb so much what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine
well maybe that’s what i was going for
well then you’ll want some manganese
that was fun maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores
oh i don’t know sheldon it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun i had today
are you sure there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk for example i noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time
well think about it it’s a product that doesn’t spoil and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years
you want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons
well thirty thirty five hey when did your mother go into menopause
okay i’m not talking about this with you
oh penny this is a natural human process and we’re talking about statistically significant savings now if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle are you fairly regular penny shuts door in his face okay no warehouse store but we’re still on for putput golf right
hey i just ran into penny she seemed upset about something
i think it’s her time of the month i marked the calendar for future reference
what happened to your scrambled egg research
oh that was a dead end scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be
i read an article about japanese scientists who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals and i thought hey fish nightlights
it’s a billion dollar idea shhhhh
mum’s the word sheldon are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to gablehauser and get your job back
oh no no no no i’ve too much to do
that’s just the beginning i also have an idea for a bulk mailorder feminine hygiene company oh glow in the dark tampons leonard we’re going to be rich
thank you for coming on such short notice
you did the right thing calling
i didn’t know what else to do he’s lost all focus every day he’s got a new obsession they enter the apartment sheldon is weaving on a loom he is wrapped in a poncho this is a particularly disturbing one
oh you got yourself a loom how nice
honey why did you get a loom
i was working with luminous fish and i thought hey loom mom what are you doing here
because one of the great minds of the twentyfirst century is raising glowinthedark fish and weaving sarapes
this is not a sarape this is a poncho a sarape is open at the sides a poncho is closed this is a poncho and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother
really when was the last time you left the house
i went to the market with penny
well then buckle up in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby
sweetheart your little friend is concerned about you
yes well i’m not a child i’m a grown man capable of living my life as i see fit and i certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother
to my room and noone’s allowed in
he gets his temper from his daddy
all that science stuff that comes from jesus
oh leonard don’t trouble yourself he’s stubborn he may stay in there ‘til the rapture
are we so sure that’s a bad thing
i’ll tell ya i love the boy to death but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the kmart
excuse me for being so bold but i now see where sheldon gets his smouldering good looks
oh honey that ain’t going to work but you keep trying to raj i made chicken i hope that isn’t one of the animals that you people think is magic you know we have an indian gentleman at our church a dr patel it’s a beautiful story the lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20 off on lasic you know those that needed it
that is a lovely story um are we going to do anything about sheldon
oh we will you have to take your time with sheldon his father god rest his soul used to say to me mary you have to take your time with sheldon
oh not so wise he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish so everybody grab a plate and a pretty place mat that shelly wove
has shelly ever freaked out like this before
oh all the time i remember one summer when he was thirteen he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town well the only problem was he had no whatchacall fissionable materials anyway when he went on the internets to get some a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it’s against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed
well the poor boy had a fit locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray
well that’s what he called it didn’t even slow down the neighbour kids it pissed our dog off to no end you know you two make a cute couple
no we’re not we’re not not a couple two singles like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that… are friends
did i pluck a nerve there
okay alright everybody it’s time to eat everybody begins to do so oh lord we thank you for this meal all your bounty and we pray that you help sheldon get back on his rocker to raj and howard now after a moment of silent meditation i’m going to end with “in jesus’ name” but you two don’t feel any obligation to join in unless of course the holy spirit moves you
oh my god this is the best cobbler i’ve ever had
it was always sheldon’ s favourite you know what the secret ingredient is
shhh you’ll spook him he’s like a baby deer you gotta let him come to you
this is ridiculous dammit sheldon snap out of it you’re a physicist you belong at the university doing research not hiding in your room sheldon scuttles away
oh well that looks awful fancy what is that
it’s my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon based life form
but intelligently designed by a creator right
you know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water
well i’m done fishing throwing a pair of trousers on the bed you put those on
because you’re going to go down to your office you’re going to apologise to your boss and get your job back
i’m sorry did i start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness”
i’m not going to apologise i didn’t say anything that wasn’t true
now you listen here i have been telling you since you were four years old it’s okay to be smarter than everybody but you can’t go around pointing it out
because people don’t like it remember all the asskickings you got from the neighbour kids now let’s get cracking shower shirt shoes and let’s shove off exits
wouldn’t have been any asskickings if that stupid death ray had worked
leonard the lord never gives us more than we can handle thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup
excuse me dr gablehouser are you busy
sheldon he’s just doodling get in here
let’s go baby we’re losing daylight
um as you know several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when i called you an idiot and i just wanted to say that i was wrong to point it out
i’m sorry we haven’t been introduced dr eric gablehouser
now that’s impossible you must have had him when you were a teenager
oh aren’t you sweet his father’s dead
please sheldon shouldn’t you be working
i’m not quite sure it involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me
i’m very proud of you honey you showed a lot of courage today
is dr gablehouser going to be my new daddy
alright i’m moving my infantry division augmented by a battalion of orcs from lord of the rings we flank the tennessee volunteers and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg
not so fast remember the south still has two infantry divisions plus superman and godzilla
no no no no orcs are magic superman is vulnerable to magic not to mention you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk
why don’t you just have robert e lee charge the line with shiva and ganesh
hi you guys ready to order
hang on honey shiva and ganesh the hindu gods against the entire union army
excuse me ganesh is the remover of obstacles and shiva is the destroyer when the smoke clears abraham lincoln will be speaking hindi and drinking mint juleps
alright my boss says you either have to order or leave and never come back
what do you recommend for someone who worked up a mansized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardiofunk
i’ll take the heart smart platter
we don’t eat here i don’t know what’s good
just get a hamburger you like hamburgers
i like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers you can’t make the assumption that i’ll like the hamburgers here
i’m sorry give him a hamburger
uh which one the classic burger the ranch house burger the barbecue burger or the kobe burger
can’t we just go to big boy they only have one burger the big boy
the barbecue burger is like the big boy
excuse me in a world that already includes the big boy why would i settle for something like a big boy
because you are not at big boy
fine i’ll have the barbecue burger
waitresses don’t yell at you at big boy
i didn’t know you ate here
we don’t this is a disturbing aberration
lesley this is penny she lives across the hall from sheldon and me
and walks in quiet beauty like the night
howard i’ve asked you not to do that
lesley and i do research together at the university
yep come for the breasts stay for the brains so i’m glad i ran into you the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist
he switched over to high energy radiation research had a little mishap and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him so are you in
great we rehearse on tuesdays at your place
yeah the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone nice meeting you
yeah you too leonard i didn’t know you played the cello
yeah my parents felt that naming me leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough
if you’re into music i happen to be a human beatbox
really howard performs some of the worst beatboxing imaginable i’m actually not that into music so hey your friend’s really cute anything going on with you two
lesley no nooh what are you kidding
he asked her out once it was an embarrassing failure
oh i’m sorry was that supposed to be a secret
oh that’s too bad you guys would make a cute couple
how can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her
nevertheless this will be reflected in her tip
what did penny mean you’d make a cute couple
well i assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute an alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation is that you could manufacture one as in oh look leonard and lesley made mr and mrs goldfarb aren’t they adorable
if penny didn’t know that lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she penny thought that i should her lesley out indicating that she penny had no interest in me asking her penny out but because she did know that i had asked lesley out and that she lesley had turned me down then she penny could be offering consolation that’s too bad you would have made a cute couple but while thinking good leonard remains available
you’re talking to one of the three men in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought
i said i could follow it i didn’t say i cared
maybe some time you can try that on my instrument
that was fun lesley thanks for including me
you’re welcome if you’re up for it we could practise that middle section again
just so we’re clear you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that i’m sexually available
i thought you weren’t interested in me
that was before i saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs
no i mean the obvious crude double entendre i’m seducing you
what can i say i’m a passionate and impulsive woman so how about it
well i thought i saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her which unless you’re a heroin addict points to sexual attraction
well i did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils so i guess there’s no point in bringing it up
no no there’s nothing going on between penny and me
so you’re open to a sexual relationship
yeah yeah i guess i am
yeah yeah it is good did you want to start now
why don’t we finish the section first
oh okay a little musical foreplay terrific
i’m good i’m good to go
me too exit in direction of bedrooms
oh hey sheldon what’s going on
i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics
semiotics the study of signs and symbols it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics
okay sweetie i know you think you’re explaining yourself but you’re really not
oh come on you went to college
alright look a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re you know getting busy
so you’re saying leonard has a girl in there
well either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into bryan adams
we really shouldn’t be standing here
oh come on you know leonard’s had girls over before right
oh yes but there’s usually planning courtship and advance notice last time i was able to book a cruise to the arctic to see a solar eclipse
wait you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex
i didn’t have to the dates just happened to coincide
so do you know who’s in there
well there’s leonard picking up violin case and he’s either with lesley winkle or a 1930’s gangster
hmmm good for him good for leonard okay night
i don’t know what the protocol is here do i stay do i leave do i wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage
gee sheldon you’re asking the wrong girl i’m usually on the other side of the tie
hi leonard it’s me sheldon in the living room i just i wanted you to know i saw the tie message received you’re welcome you carry on give my best to lesley
big boy wakes up looks at watch wraps self in blanket walks towards kitchen someone touched my board oh god my board leonard leonard
my equations someone’s tampered with my equations
of course i’m sure look at the betafunction of quantum chronodynamics the sign’s been changed
oh yeah but doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having
are you insane are you out of your mind are you… hey look that fixes the problem i’ve been having
yeah i noticed it when i got up to get a glass of water so i fixed it now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies pretty cool huh
listen i got to hit the lab thanks for a great night
thank you i’ll see you at work
who told you you could touch my board
i don’t come into your house and touch your board
there are no incorrect equations on my board
i’m sorry i’ve got to run if you come up with an adjective text me leaves
inconsiderate that is the adjective inconsiderate
you can stare at your board all day sheldon she’s still going to be right
just pretty good i’d think you were doing very good
pretty very there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good why do you ask
well a little bird told me that you and lesley hooked up last night
so is it serious do you like her
wuh i don’t… ththththat’s really two different questions uh i’m not… sheldon we have to go
boy you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse
alright well i’ll talk to you later but i am so happy for you leonard
thank you what did she mean she’s happy for me is she happy because i’m seeing someone or is she happy because she thinks that i’m happy because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy you know because the second person though happy is now romantically unavailable to the first person
do you realise i may have to share a nobel prize with your booty call
you know what i’m being ridiculous but who cares what penny thinks lesley is a terrific girl she’s attractive we like each other she’s extremely intelligent
i don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky
regardless i have a chance at a real relationship with lesley i’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy
careful  leonard liquid nitrogen 320 degrees below zero
brrrr why are you smashing a flash frozen banana
because i’ve got a bowl of cheerios and i couldn’t find a knife
so anyway puts arms around her hello
just extending the intimacy do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower
okay uh what exactly do you think’s going on between us
i’m not sure but i think i’m about to discover how the banana felt
listen leonard neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex i mean dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure you stick electrodes in a rat’s brain give him an orgasm button he’ll push that thing until he starves to death
well the only difference between us and a rat is that you can’t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus that’s where you come in
yeah well i’m just glad to be a part of it so what happens now
well i don’t know about your sex drive but i’m probably good till new years
you want to make plans for new years
woah leonard please you’re smothering me
the blogosphere is abuzzing with news of you and lesley winkle making eine kleine bangbang music
wha… how did it get on the internet
well how did you know about it
a little bird told us apparently you are a magnificent beast
you know i think i may have misjudged this restaurant
i won’t go out on a limb but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger
your old tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted
way ahead of you i was thinking of moving big boy to thursdays and just dropping soup plantation
yeah the name always confused me anyway soup plantation you can’t grow soup
terrific you’ll be happy to know that i plan to come here every tuesday night for the foreseeable future
who do i speak to about permanently reserving this table
um i don’t know a psychiatrist so hey how are things with you and lesley
oh to be honest i don’t think it’s going to work out
oh oh that’s too bad well hey don’t worry i’m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you walks away smiling
well what did she mean by that was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention
you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy this is a single decker hamburger whereas the big boy is a double decker this has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio
are you even listening to me
of course i’m listening blah blah hopeless penny delusion blah blah blah
okay then you know you can grow the ingredients for soup sheldon nods
okay if noone else will say it i will we really suck at paintball
oh come on some battles you win some battles you lose
yes but you don’t have to lose to kyle bernstein’s barmitzvah party
i think we have to acknowledge those were some fairly savage preadolescent jews
you know we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command
no i want to talk about the fact that wolowitz shot me in the back
i shot you for good reason you were leading us into disaster
i was giving clear concise orders
you hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah get the kid in the yarmulkah”
so how was paintball did you have fun
sure if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun to howard you clear space on your calendar there will be an enquiry
okay um oh hey i’m having a party on saturday so if you guys are around you should come by
well there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party so it’ll just be a bunch of my friends we’ll have some beer do a little dancing…
but thanks thanks for thinking of us
are you sure come on it’s halloween
yes but are the costumes random or genre specific
he’s asking if we can come as anyone from sciencefiction fantasy…
tv  film dd manga greek gods roman gods norse gods…
anything you want okay any costume you want bye
i’ll get it he enters wearing a flash costume opens door
bjow they stare at each other in shock
oh no he is also wearing a flash costume
make way for the fastest man alive enters also in a flash costume oh no
see this is why i wanted to have a costume meeting
we all have other costumes we can change
or we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast
no no no it’s a boygirl party this flash runs solo
okay how about this nobody gets to be the flash we all change agreed
hey sorry i’m late but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus
what just because i’m indian i can’t be a norse god no no no raj has to be an indian god that’s racism i mean look at wolowitz he’s not english but he’s dressed like peter pan sheldonentering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines is neither sound nor light but he’s obviously the doppler effect
i’m not peter pan i’m robin hood
really because i saw peter pan and you’re dressed exactly like cathy rigby she was a little bigger than you but it’s basically the same look man
hey sheldon there’s something i want to talk to you about before we go to the party
i don’t care if anybody gets it i’m going as the doppler effect
if i have to i can demonstrate neeeeoooowwwww
terrific um this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group and i need you not to embarrass me tonight
well what exactly do you mean by embarrass you
for example tonight noone needs to know that my middle name is leakey
well there’s nothing embarrassing about that your father worked with lewis leakey a great anthropologist it had nothing to do with your bedwetting
all i’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for penny to see me as a member of her peer group a potential close friend and… perhaps more i don’t want to look like a dork
just a heads up fellas if anyone gets lucky i’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver
and you said the party starts at seven
well yeah when you start a party at seven noone shows up at you know seven
yes yes it is okay well um come on in
what are all the girls in the bathroom
probably but in their own homes
so what time does the costume parade start
yeah so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume you know most frightening most authentic most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle
oh sheldon i’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes
this party is just going to suck
no come on it’s going to be fun and you all look great i mean look at you thor and oh peter pan that’s so cute
i’m peter pan and i’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it
no you don’t oh hey what’s sheldon supposed to be
yes it’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer
oh sure i see it now the doppler effect alright i’ve got to shower you guys um make yourselves comfortable
mmmm by odin’s beard this is good chex mix
no thanks peanuts i can’t afford to swell up in these tights
i’m confused if there’s no costume parade what are we doing here
oh hey when did you get here hi
penny is wearing the worst catwoman costume i have ever seen and that includes halle berry’s
she’s not catwoman she’s just a generic cat
and that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition
hey guys check out the sexy nurse i believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough
i’m going to use the mirror technique she brushes her hair back i brush my hair back she shrugs i shrug subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync we belong together
where do you get this stuff
you know psychology journals internet research and there’s this great show on vh1 about how to pick up girls
oh if only i had his confidence i have such difficulty speaking to women or around women or at times even effeminate men
if that’s a working stethoscope maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat
no seriously you can i have transient idiopathic arrhythmia
i  want to get to know penny’s friends i just i don’t know how to talk to these people
well i actually might be able to help
like jane goodall observing the apes i initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured but patterns emerge they have their own language if you will
well it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “how wasted am i” which is met with an approving chorus of “dude”
that’s as far as i’ve gotten
this is ridiculous i’m jumping in
aren’t you afraid i’ll embarrass you
yes but i need a wingman
alright but if we’re going to use flight metaphors i’m much more suited to being the guy from the faa analysing wreckage
so what are you supposed to be
me i’ll give you a hint neeeeooooowwwww
okay if that is some sort of learning disability i think it’s very insensitive
why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra
well why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves
yes well i’m the doppler effect
what do you suppose he’s doing here besides disrupting the local gravity field
if he were any bigger he’d have moons orbiting him
oh snap so i guess we’ll be leaving now
why should we leave for all we know he crashed the party and penny doesn’t even want him here penny and kurt hug
maybe they just want to be friends
or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more
then he and i are on equal ground
yes but you’re much closer to it than he is
look if this was 15000 years ago by virtue of his size and strength kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners
and male partners animal partners large primordial eggplants pretty much whatever tickled his fancy
yes but our society has undergone a paradigm shift in the information age sheldon you and i are the alpha males we shouldn’t have to back down
true why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down
no i’m going to assert my dominance face to face
face to face are you going to wait for him to sit down or are you going to stand on a coffee table
oh hey guys you having a good time
given the reaction to my costume this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system
and what are you supposed to be an elf
uh a hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth whereas an elf is an immortal tall warrior
so why the hell would you want to be a hobbit
because he is neither tall nor immortal and none of us could be the flash
well whatever why don’t you go hop off on a quest i’m talking to penny here
i think we’re all talking to penny here
okay maybe you didn’t hear me go away
aw i am being nice right little buddy
okay i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me i mean you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery
are you calling me a puffy animal
of course not no he’s not you’re not right leonard
no i said animalistic of course we’re all animals but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree
if he understands that you’re in trouble
you know you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf
no penny it’s okay i can handle this i’m not a dwarf i’m a hobbit a hobbit are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from shortterm to longterm memory
okay now you’re starting to make me mad
a homohabilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what
i think i’ve made my point
yeah how about i make a point out of your pointy little head
let me remind you while my moral support is absolute in a physical confrontation i will be less than useless
there’s not going to be a confrontation in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation
c – o – n… frontation
kurt put him down this instant
i don’t care i’m finishing it put him down
fine you’re one lucky little leprechaun
he’s a hobbit i’ve got your back
yeah no i’m fine it’s good it’s a good party thanks for having us it’s just getting a little late so…
oh okay alright well thank you for coming
happy halloween they leave if it’s any consolation i thought that homohabilus line really put him in his place
tea when people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages there there you want to talk about it
good there there was really all i had
hey i just wanted to make sure you’re okay
i’m so sorry about what happened
yes it is that’s why i broke up with him he always does stuff like that
so why was he at your party
well i ran into him last week and he was…  just all apologetic about how he’s changed he was just going on and on and i believed him and i’m an idiot because i always believe guys like that and… i can’t go back to my party because he’s there and i know you don’t want to hear this and i’m upset and i’m really drunk and i just want to… bursts into tears and rests head on leonard’s shoulder
god what is wrong with me
you really think so don’t you she kisses hm
how much have you had to drink tonight
are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here
it might boy you’re really smart
leonard you are so great why can’t all guys be like you
because if all guys were like me the human race couldn’t survive
thank you she kisses him again kurt is watching
that’s right you saw what you saw that’s how we roll in the shire closes door quickly locks and chains it
he’s not here maybe the avenger summoned him
he’s not the marvel comic story he’s the original norse god
i’m supposed to give him a ride home
well i’m sure he’ll be fine he has his hammer
watch this it’s really cool call leonard hofstadter
did you say call helen boxleitner
did you say call temple beth sader
here let me try call mcflono mcfloonyloo hehheh
calling rajesh koothrappali raj’s phone rings
oh that’s very impressive and a little racist
if we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology can we get on with halo night we were supposed to start at eight it is now 8
yes first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time bathroom time or the pizza break
we can split it two two and two
if we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can’t take it out of bathroom time there is a knock on the door
oh what fresh hell is this
see a penny pick her up and all the day you’ll have good luck
no you won’t uh can i hide out here for a while
well there’s this girl i know from back in nebraska christie well anyway she called me up and she’s like “hey how’s california” and i’m like “awesome” ‘cos you know it’s not nebraska and the next thing i know she’s invited herself out here to stay with me
anyway she got here today and she’s just been in my apartment yakketyyakking about every guy she’s slept with in omaha which is basically every guy in omaha and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink
well is she doing it one thong at a time or does she just throw it all in like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse
he really needs to dial it down
so if you don’t like this christie why are you letting her stay
well she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother so she’s kind of family
you know i apologise for my earlier outburst who needs halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha
oh i don’t think she’s a whore
no yeah she’s definitely a whore i mean she has absolutely no standards this one time she was at… where’s howard
bonjour mademoiselle i understand you’re new in town
ugh i cannot believe christie let howard into my apartment
and i cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more serious note it’s 8
okay fine we’ll just play one on one until he gets back
one on one we don’t play one on one we play teams not one on one one on one
well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half
oh sure cut the foreigner in half there’s a billion more where he came from
hey if you guys need a fourth i’ll play
uh no the wheel was a great idea relativity was a great idea this is a notion and a rather sucky one at that
this is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve there are myriad weapons vehicles and strategies to master not to mention an extremely intricate backstory
oh cool whose head did i just blow off
okay i got this lock and load boys
it’s the only way we can play teams
yes but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh… another explosion
haha there goes your head again
okay this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned you need to give them a chance to explosion now come on
raj raj she’s got me cornered cover me
okay that’s it i don’t know how but she is cheating noone can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game
wait wait sheldon come back you forgot something
this plasma grenade explosion ha look it’s raining you
you laugh now you just wait until you need tech support
gosh he’s kind of a sore loser isn’t he
well to be fair he is also a rather unpleasant winner
you know penny we make such a good team maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime
or we could just have a life
i guess for you that’s an option
as usual nice talking to you raj leaves
what do you suppose she meant by that
and another thing there’s a certain ethic to the game penny a well estab…
well she could have said goodbye
it’s called carpal tunnel syndrome and quite frankly you deserve it
um well howard and christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom
look i grew up on a farm okay from what i heard they’re either having sex or howard’s caught in a milking machine do you mind if i stay here tonight
no take the couch or my bed i just got new pillows hypoallergenics
hold that thought leonard a moment
let me guess you have a problem with this
it’s up to you crazy person’s choice
well first we don’t have house guests frankly if i could afford the rent i’d ask you to leave
your friendship means a lot to me as well what else
well our earthquake supplies we have a two day two man kit
so if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon
i’m sorry are you suggesting that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism
noone ever thinks it will happen until it does
penny if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep you can stay
he’s engaging in reductioadabsurdum it’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result and i do not appreciate it
i’ll get you a blanket and a pillow
okay well since i’m obviously being ignored here let’s go over the morning schedule i use the bathroom from 7 to 7
how am i supposed to plan my bodily functions
i suggest no liquids after 11pm
thanks leonard arranges pillows on left of couch
your head goes on the other end
it’s culturally universal a bed even a temporary bed is always oriented with the headboard away from the door it serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders
yes if you use my toothbrush i’ll jump out that window please don’t come to my funeral have a good night
fyi his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the uv light
funny expression sleep tight it refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight
every saturday since we have lived in this apartment i have awakened at 6
every saturday since we have lived in this apartment i have awakened at 6
i know i know look you have a tv in your room why don’t you just have breakfast in bed
because i am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating mother’s day
what the hell is your problem
okay this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity i now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste
why do you people hate sleep are you wearing my robe
oh yeah sorry i’ll have it cleaned
that’s okay keep it where’s christie
in the shower oh by the way where did you get that loofah mitt yours reaches places that mine just won’t
more precisely we used your loofah i exfoliated her brains out
ah well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection
mmmm there’s my little engine that could
well there’s one beloved children’s book i’ll never read again
uh so christie what are your plans
oh well howard said he’d take me shopping in beverley hills
yeah no i meant plans to find some place to live other than with me not that i don’t love having you but it’s… a little crowded
penny you’re always welcome to stay with us
oh terrific now we’re running a cute little bb
let me offer a little outside the box thinking here why doesn’t christie stay with me
for one thing you live with your mother
i do not my mother lives with me
well then it’s all settled christie will stay with howard penny can go back to her apartment and i’ll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who although at this point it’s more like doctor why bother
so what do you say you wanna repair to castle wolowitz
what is that like a mexican deli
i’m sorry i should have mentioned this earlier my last name is wolowitz
oh that’s so cool my first jew
i imagine there aren’t many kosher cornhuskers
but you’re still taking me shopping right
okay i’ll go pack my stuff
when they perfect human cloning i’m going to order twelve of those
howard can’t you see she’s using you
who cares last night she pulled off her blouse and i wept
look howard i know her okay she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things
yay if you’ll excuse me i have some barmizvah bonds to cash
i’m sorry we cannot do this without wolowitz
we can’t order chinese food without wolowitz
let me walk you through it our standard is the steamed dumpling appetizer general so’s chicken beef with broccoli shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lomain do you see the problem
our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people
so we’ll just order three entrees
fine what do you want to eliminate and who gets the extra dumpling
we could cut it into thirds
then it is no longer a dumpling once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich
hi fellas oh where’s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks mandarin
he’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good pointing at waiter where he comes from that’s punishable by death
can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four
this isn’t a substitution it’s a reduction
fine bring us three orders of dumplings that’s twelve we’ll each have four
no if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree
if we have extra we’ll just take the leftovers home
and divide it how i’m telling you we cannot do this without wolowitz
wolowitz is with his new girlfriend if you had let me invite penny then you would have had your fourth
have you seen penny eat chinese food she uses a fork and she double dips her egg rolls
exactly but we’d have to if she was here
can we please make a decision not only are there children starving in india there’s an indian starving right here
here’s an idea why don’t we just go out for indian food
you are nice boys tell you what i’m going to do i’m going to bring you the four dumplings when i’m walking over to the table maybe i get bumped one of the dumplings falls to the floor noone has to know
yeah we can always divide soup
well with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christie
she’s not my friend friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty
right anyway uh with wolowitz occupied elsewhere we had something we wanted to ask you sheldon
yes penny we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our halo team i don’t think i need to tell you what an honour this is
oh that’s so sweet but i’m going out dancing with a girlfriend
you can’t go out it’s halo night
well for penny it’s dancing night
look why don’t i play with you guys tomorrow
tonight is halo night it’s like talking to a wall
alright now sheldon you and i are about to have a problem
yes but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational
alright fellas i gotta go good luck
maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend
okay assuming we could dance which we can’t there are three of us and two of them
it’s the chinese restaurant all over again i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67 of a woman
aaah for god’s sake sheldon you are driving me crazy
your anger’s not with me sir but with basic mathematics
no i’m pretty sure my anger’s with you
what’s happening to us we’re falling apart
the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe
and this is christie van der bell
we can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex
you’re not going to put that on your message are you
no i’m just kidding i’ll rerecord it beep
sheldon think this through you’re going to ask howard to choose between sex and halo
no i’m going to ask him to choose between sex and halo 3 as far as i know sex has not been upgraded to include highdef graphics and enhanced weapon systems
you’re right all sex has is nudity orgasms and human contact
i’m just saying you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while
why so you and howard can hump on it
ladies ladies i’m sure there’s a middle ground
you girl’s talk i’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin
are you happy you drove your own son out of the house
why don’t you stop butting in where you don’t belong
what are you guys doing here
he’s not a man he’s a putz and don’t you take that tone with me you gold digger
you heard me and i’ll tell you something else you’re barking up the wrong tree cos as long as you’re around howard is out of the will
that’s right go back to babylon you whore
i thought she was the whore of omaha
sheldon you got him in your sights fire he’s charging his plasma rifle
i can’t shoot now i’m cloaking
that’s why the call it cloaking dead man
hi guys my friends and i got tired of dancing so we came over to have sex with you
that will do raj straight for the tank
there are no rules in hell
son of a bitch medpack i need a medpack
there’s a sniper use your rocket launcher
all i’ve got is a needler and i’m all out of ammo
and now you’re out of life why did you hit pause
the online description was completely misleading they said eight slots plus removable id to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards but they don’t tell you the removable id takes up one slot it’s a nightmare
okay now do you really need the honorary justice league of america membership card
it’s been in every wallet i’ve owned since i was five
it says keep this on your person at all times knock on door it’s right here under batman’s signature
and this is leonard and sheldon’s apartment
guess whose parents just got broadband
may i present live from new delhi dr and mrs v m koothrappali
lift up the camera i’m looking at his crotch
oh that’s nice like haroun and tanweer
no no not like haroun and tanweer
such sweet young men they just adopted the cutest little punjabi baby
yeah we’re not like haroun and tanweer
so are you boys academics like our son
and your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential
god it’s just a question he’s so sensitive
okay that’s my life that’s my friends good to see you say goodbye
wait wait before you go we have good news put the computer down and gather your friends
is it just me or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless
rajesh do you remember lalita gupta
the little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable
yes well now she’s a dental student at usc so we gave her your contact information
you’re 26 years old rajesh we want grandchildren
if you decide on a spring wedding we can avoid monsoon season
it’s up to you dear we don’t want to meddle
if you don’t want to meddle then why are you meddling
if i may your parents probably don’t consider this meddling while arranged marriages are no longer the norm indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives
why are you telling me about my own culture
sorry mommy papa but with all due respect i really can’t go through…
sorry darling we have to go doogie howser is on grandma it’s doogie time bye bye
neither do i doogie howser’s been off the air for like twenty years
actually i read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in india
it might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession
excuse me hello my parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger what am i going to do
i suggest you go through with it
romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century up until then arranged marriages were the norm and it served society quite well
it’s the entire premise of fiddler on the roof
i’m not a big fan of musicals but i love that show
me too of course it speaks to me culturally
understandable but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity
let’s not forget it’s got some really catchy tunes
okay i know what i’m going to do
so who wants to rent fiddler
no need we have the special edition
well maybe we are like haroun and tanweer
this is dr sheldon cooper yeah i need to cancel my membership to the planetarium yeah well i’m sorry too but there’s just no room for you in my wallet yeah i understand but it was between you and the museum of natural history and frankly you don’t have dinosaurs well i’ll miss you too bye bye okay i know you’re texting about me and i’d really like you to stop
oh dear i am rightly and truly screwed
hey i thought you were finding new friends
i’ve got some feelers out in the meantime listen to this
hi rajesh this is lalita gupta your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me so i’m calling you and ah… call me back bye
can you believe how pushy she is
if i don’t call her i won’t hear the end of it from my parents
how can i call her you know i can’t talk to women
just give it to me dials
don’t worry you’ll thank me in a fake indian accent hello lalita raj koothrappali raj starts to chase howard across the room yes it is good to talk to you too so what are you wearing oh not important so anyhow when would you like to meet friday works for me and i call you with the time and place but in the meantime keep it real babe in own voice you may now thank me
for what making me sound like a simpsons character
fine next time make your own date
i didn’t want to make this one
look on the bright side she might turn out to be a nice beautiful girl
great then we’ll get married i won’t be able to talk to her and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence
okay there’s a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try but if your research is going to have human applications may i suggest white mice instead their brain chemistry is far closer to ours
i swear to god sheldon one day i’m going to get the hang of talking to you
his mom’s been saying that for years what’s up
well i finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift so i need to practice making drinks
oh great well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition
with certain obvious exceptions suicide for example
look penny we’d love to help you but raj is going through some stuff right now and besides he doesn’t drink so… raj whispers in his ear really um raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking
okay here you go leonard one tequila sunrise
thank you this drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container thank you
okay raj what’ll it be raj whispers in leonard’s ear
uh how about a grasshopper i make a mean grasshopper okay good coming up sheldon what are you going to have
okay can you please order a cocktail i need to practice mixing drinks
fine i’ll have a virgin cuba libre
that’s um rum and coke without the rum
yes and would you make it diet
there’s a can in the fridge
a cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge
bartenders are supposed to have people skills
okay raj here you go alright who’s next
i’d like to try a slippery nipple
okay you’re cut off anybody need a refill
where did my life go penny one day i’m a carefree batchelor and the next i’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi
a… are you talking to me
is there another penny here i had such plans i had dreams i was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astrophysics but with a penis of course
ever since i was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him how can i be a gynaecologist i can barely look a woman in the eye you know what i’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer it’s time for a showdown somebody give me a computer with a webcam
okay sweetie i think that’s the grasshopper talking
and it’s about to tell my parents that i’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta
okay calm down noone can make you get married why don’t you just meet this girl and see what happens
haven’t you been listening to me i cannot talk to women
no no let’s see how long it takes him
um raj honey you say you can’t talk to women but… you’ve been talking to me
you’re right i… i am talking to you hello penny how are you
okay now i just need to make sure i have a lalita before i meet the grasshopper it’s a sweet green miracle
okay if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it
overdo what happiness freedom this warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey
yeah that uh why don’t you bring her to my restaurant when i’m tending the bar so i can keep an eye on you
wait a minute what’s the plan here let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married what’s he going to do stay drunk for the rest of his life
i can’t believe i’m sitting here next to little lalita gupta
little lalita that’s kind of fun to say little lalita little lalita little lalita you should try it
you have lost so much weight that must have been difficult for you because you were so so fat do you remember
of course you do who could forget being that fat
so you’re a dental student hmm are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate not as high as say air traffic controllers but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers so in pure numbers you’re still winning
you have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious
drinks do not work that way
i’d say he was doing fine look at her last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail
nothing i just really didn’t want to come virgin diet cuba libre please
in a tall glass with a lime wedge
oh i’ll wedge it right in there
so how’s koothrappali d… oh my lord
i’m pretty sure her name’s lalita
no no princess punchali from the monkey and the princess
oh yeah i tried to watch that online but they wanted a credit card
when i was a little boy and got sick which was most of the time my mother would read it to me it’s about an indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different for some reason i related to it quite strongly
we all know the reason sheldon what are you getting at
that woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess punchali in the book how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life
every year at comic con every day at disneyland you can hire snow white to come to your house course they prefer it if you have a kid but…
hey guys this is lalita gupta lalita this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny isn’t it great she isn’t fat any more
forgive me your highness for i am but a monkey and it is in my nature to climb i did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair
you are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess punchali
oh no kidding oh who is that
a beloved character from an indian folk tale
oh us indian or “come to our casino” indian
the resemblance is remarkable i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair
thanks i imagine you smell very nice too
i shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as i can
but you’re a dentist he’s nuts
don’t be insulting rajesh so sheldon tell me more about this princess you say i look like
it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips
if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath
and i am not your lady
you are my lady our parents said so we are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up
okay let’s get something straight here the only reason i came tonight was to get my parents off my case i certainly don’t need to be getting this old world crap from you
exactly the kind of spirit with which princess punchali led the monkeys to freedom
hey you can’t talk to me like that
luckily for you she could have you beheaded
beats the hell out of me
i’ll tell you what just happened i just learned how to pick up indian chicks
what are we supposed to say to lalita’s parents
i play golf with her father i won’t be able to look at him
maybe you should keep your eye on the ball papa
oh now you’re a funny man this is not funny mr funny man
doctor and mrs koothrappali in all fairness it wasn’t entirely raj’s fault
this is a family matter sheldon
oh sorry you all look alike to us
but he’s right papa listen to him sheldon enters you you are the one who ruined everything
who is it we can’t see
go ahead tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren
how would i know do you have a low sperm count
this has nothing to do with my sperm count
you are wearing the boxers that we sent you aren’t you rajesh
because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities
can we please stop talking about my testicles sheldon tell them what you did
you left with his date friends don’t do that to each other
sorry that’s all you can say is sorry
take it raj it’s more than i’ve ever gotten
and may i point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring
i knew it he moves to america and becomes an alcoholic
it was just this one time papa i swear
are you in denial do we have to come over and do an intervention
don’t embarrass him in front of his friends
alright carry us outside we want to talk to you in private
please wait until i get into the hall
hold on what happened with you and lalita
we ate she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks nothing i didn’t already know and i came home
so you’re not going to see her again
why would i see her again i already have a dentist exits
i wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren
i don’t believe it what’s gotten into him
oh maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty
hey you do your experiments i do mine
gentlemen i am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local isp racing down fibreoptic cable at the speed of light to san francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to lisbon portugal where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in halifax novascotia and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our isp and the x10 receiver attached to this clicks mouse lamp switches on lamp the others cheer and clap
look at me look at me i’ve got goosebumps
are we ready on the stereo
no problem turning it down using mouse again san francisco lisbon halifax the music gets quieter et voila
hang on hang on do you not realise what we just did
yeah you turned your stereo down with your laptop
no we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet
oh you know you can just get one of those universal remotes at radio shack they’re really cheap
no no no you don’t get it um howard enable public access
public access enabled they all stare around for a moment in silence
boy that’s brilliant but i’ll see you
no hang on hang on the lamp goes off and on again see
someone in sezchuan province china is using his computer to turn our lights on and off
huh well that’s handy um here’s a question why
they found the remote controlled cars
well wait wait what’s on top of them
the monster truck is out of austin texas and the blue viper is being operated from suburban tel aviv
you may want to put on slacks
what seeing red car is trying to get between her legs ew stop it no leave me alone
you know in the future when we’re disembodied brains in jars we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted
i don’t want to be in a jar i want my brain in an android body eight feet tall and ripped
i’m with you i just have to make sure if i’m a synthetic human i’d still be jewish i promised my mother
i suppose you could have your android penis circumcised but that’s something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers
not to mention you’d have to power down on saturdays
sheldon why is this letter in the trash
well there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but occam’s razor would suggest that someone threw it out
it’s from the institute for experimental physics they want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on boweseinstein condensates
i know i read it before i threw it out
okay… if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question why did you throw it out
because i have no interest in standing in the rose room of the pasadena marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech which if i were there it would be
i don’t know sheldon those topical conferences on boweseinstein condensates parties are legendary
forget the parties what a nerd
are there any other honours i’ve gotten that i don’t know about did ups drop off a nobel prize with my name on it
leonard please don’t take this the wrong way but the day you win a nobel prize is the day i begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets
hoohoohoo the only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma”
i’ve got one hey leonard your mamma’s research methodology is so flawed…
shut up howard sheldon we have to do this
no we don’t we have to take in nourishment expel waste and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying everything else is optional
okay let me put it this way i’m doing it
you can’t i’m the lead author
oh come on the only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically
i let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea not to put too fine a point on it but i was throwing you a bone you’re welcome
excuse me i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis
so the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word
they’re not supposed to but they should
alright i don’t care what you say i’m going to the conference and i’m presenting our findings
if i’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is
oh you admit that it’s our work
no once again i’m throwing you a bone and once again you are welcome
so how’s it going with sheldon are you guys still not talking to each other
not only is he still not talking to me but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode you know like in the classic scifi movie scanners put’s fingers to head you know bzzzpchew never mind how about this one it says “i know my physics but i’m still a fun guy”
oh hey i didn’t know they still made corduroy suits
they don’t that’s why i saved this one
okay well let’s just see what else you have okay here take this and this and this and these
is this all stuff you want me to try on
no this is stuff i want you to throw out
seriously don’t even give it to charity you won’t be helping anyone what’s this
oh that’s the bottled city of kandor
you see kandor was the capital city of the planet krypton it was miniaturised by brainiac before krypton exploded and then rescued by superman
it’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it
here why don’t you put these on while i find a shirt and sportcoat to match
well where you going just put them on
i know you won’t look why would you look there’s nothing to see well not nothing…
so you know isn’t there maybe some way you and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing
no no scientists do not compromise our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions not to mention sheldon is batcrap crazy
oh careful that’s my original series battlestar galactica flight suit
oh why didn’t you wear it at halloween
because it’s not a costume it’s a flight suit
okay alright moving on oh wow a paisley shirt
uhhuh it goes with my corduroy suit
if you mean it should end up in the same place then i agree is this your… your only tie
ah technically yes but if you’ll notice it’s reversible so it works as two
oh sweetie i don’t think it even works as one is this all your clothes
yeah everything since the eighth grade
okay well i guess we’re back to the corduroy suit
yup leonard picks up paisley shirt i said no put it down
uh just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly
oh you know that is so weird that yours came and mine didn’t sheldon looks confused it was a joke sheldon gives a fake laugh yup tip your waitresses i’m here all week
penny just to save you from further awkwardness know that i’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence
oh yeah me too zip it lock it the begin to climb put it in your pocket so you and leonard…
a little misunder… galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding
anyway i was talking to leonard this morning and i think he feels really bad about it
well i’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend
oh i hadn’t thought about it like that i wonder if i’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil
you should just talk to him i’m sure you guys can work this out
it’s certainly preferable to my plan
okay so you absolutely should talk to him look i know leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing
yeah i mean he tried to explain it to me i didn’t really understand it but…
of course you didn’t he said little idea
uh well no no not in… not in those words
um gee the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s
hey sheldon i’ve been thinking instead of arguing about this why don’t…
don’t you ever speak to me again
what… sheldon goes into apartment and slams the door
uh he… makes “he’s screwy” hand movements turns to go
okay i’m leaving for the conference
have fun presenting my lucky hunch
sheldon i didn’t mean it like that
then why did you say it
i don’t know i wasn’t choosing my…
were you trying to impress penny
no no not at all a little bit
how’d that work out for you
okay i’m going to ask you one more time we did the work together lets present the paper together
and i’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering it’s undignified and bite me
goodbye penny places fingers to head to try to make leonard’s brain explode leonard leaves oooh one of these days pkshhhh
you’re right this side does look better
no no i didn’t say better i said less stained
i just checked the house there’s probably twenty twentyfive people in there
all in particle physics twenty five is woodstock
i wasn’t expecting such a crowd i’m a little nervous
it’s okay just open with a joke you’ll be fine
a joke okay how about this um okay uh there’s this farmer and he has these chickens but they won’t lay any eggs so he calls a physicist to help the physicist then does some calculations and he says um i have a solution but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum raj and howard laugh right
oh sorry i’ve just i’ve heard it before
i really should have brought my own car
so in conclusion the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero the moment of inertia changes and the solid becomes a supersolid which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter applause thank you penny is asleep on howard’s shoulder howard is taking a photograph with his camera phone are there any questions
yeah what the hell was that
doctor sheldon cooper here i am the lead author of this particular paper no reaction thank you and you sir you have completely skipped over the part where i was walking through the park and i saw these children on a merrygoround which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero
i didn’t skip it it’s just an anecdote it’s not science
oh i see was the apple falling on newton’s head was that just an anecdote
no no that’s true gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple
you cannot possibly be that arrogant
you continue to underestimate me my good man
look if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me
as i have explained repeatedly unlike you i don’t need validation from lesser minds no offence
really so why did you come
because i knew you’d screw this up
oh please i admit that spherical chicken joke that was hilarious but it was straight downhill from there
i’ve had enough of your condescension maybe i didn’t go to college when i was eleven like you maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room no offense and i am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation
so you admit that you’re an egotist
yes to audience my name is dr leonard hofstadter and i could never please my parents so i need to get all my selfesteem from strangers like you but he’s worse
okay that is it tries to explode brain again
you cannot blow up my head with your mind
then i’ll settle for an aneurysm
you hit me you saw him he hit me
you were trying to blow up my head
it wasn’t it was not you are a nutcase
oh we’ll see about that tries again heads up you people in the front row this is a splash zone
stop stop it quit it the start to fight
is this usually how these physics things go
you could have offered me a ride home
you’re lucky i didn’t run you over
i really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about you begged me to come i came there’s just no pleasing you
you’re right i’m the problem i’m the one that needs help
well that’s not much of an apology but i’ll take it
excuse me is there anything you’d like to apologise for
yes i’m sorry i tried to blow up your head it was uncalled for
somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube
that would be me hey check it out it’s a featured video the watch
oh jeez is this suit really look that bad
forget your suit look at my arms waving i’m like a flamingo on ritalin
howard would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “me and my girlfriend”
see the liquid metal terminators were created in the future by skynet and skynet was developed by miles dyson but that future no longer exists due to dyson’s death in terminator 2
okay then riddle me this assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by skynet but then reprogrammed by the future john connor why would skynet an artificial computer intelligence bother to create a petite hot 17 yearold killer robot
skynet is kinky i don’t know
artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes
alright oh wait they use it to in…
buzzing noise too late i win
let’s goohoh ouoooout tonight i have to goohohoh ouooooout tonight
i don’t know but if cats could sing they’d hate it too the continue up the stairs and disappear from view
you wanna prowl be my night owl leonard and sheldon reappear running down the stairs we’ll take my… appearing hey guys hi where you going
what oh we just had to… mail some letters and seeing sheldon has large bag in hand and bin is nearby throw away some chicken sheldon very reluctantly does
you’ll never guess what just happened
i don’t guess as a scientist i reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as i’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot
believe it or not personal growth what happened
alright remember when i auditioned for that workshop production of rent but i didn’t get it and i couldn’t figure out why
i have a conclusion based on an observation
no you don’t no he doesn’t
well the girl they picked to play mimi she dropped out and they asked me to replace her
oh congratulations what a lucky break
it’s not a big deal just a one night showcase but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so you never know
it’s this friday at eight you guys want to come
because… uh friday we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium
i think that’s a week from tuesday at six
no it’s this friday at eight
oh too bad well i got to get to rehearsal see you guys
and you did it so casually no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration
so lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath
sheldon are you worried about your safety
no i imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago
knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard…
i need to speak to you
it’s two o’clock in the morning
i highly doubt that go away long pause are you still out there
you’re right it can wait until morning
never mind i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle you’re in no state to talk
i’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny
what was i supposed to say
you could have told her the truth
that would have hurt her feelings
then i suppose you could have agreed to go
and what would i have said afterwards
i would suggest something to the effect of singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree i’d recommend you have a cat scan to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain
i couldn’t say that i would have to say you were terrific and i can’t wait to hear you sing again
it’s the social protocol it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at
i was not aware of that
when we played chess earlier you were terrific and i can’t wait to play you again goodnight
knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock…
oooaw this would be so much easier if i were a violent sociopath opening door what
i was analysing our lie and i believe we’re in danger of penny seeing through the ruse
simple if she were to log on to wwwsocalphysicsgrouporgactivitiesother click on upcoming events scroll down to seminars download the pdf schedule and look for the seminar on molecular positronium well then bippidyboppidyboo our pants are metaphorically on fire
well sir my trousers will not be igniting today
knock knock knock knock penny knock knock knock knock penny knock knock knock knock penny door opens good morning
do you have any idea what time it is
of course i do my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder colorado it’s accurate to one tenth of a second but as i’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical
remember how leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium
he lied and i’m feeling very uncomfortable about it
hungry tired i’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit
you told her i lied why would you tell her i lied
i’m sorry i’m not seeing the help
she was going to see through your lie eventually so i told her that you were lying to protect me
oh i’m getting a bad feeling
hunger indigestion i’m sorry i’m really not very good at this anyway penny now believes that on friday night we’re going to participate in my cousin leopold’s drug intervention
yea who most people call leo but he also answers to lee remember that it’s important
details leonard the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details
do you have a cousin leopold
no i made him up i think you’d call him lee
i don’t get it i already told her a lie why replace it with a different lie
well first of all your lie was laughably transparent where mine is exquisitely convoluted while you were sleeping i was weaving an ununravelable web
yes if she googles leopold houston she’ll find a facebook page an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmonycom
okay why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousing
ah because it’s in long beach and i don’t drive
no of course not there’s no cousin leo there’s no intervention focus leonard
we just leave the house on friday night and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab
so he goes back into rehab
yes but he can relapse if penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again
you still told her i lied
for a noble purpose to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drugaddled first cousin which i’m assuming is embarrassing yes
i don’t know how am i supposed to remember all of this
that’s the best part you don’t have to see i told penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force
so she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach
oh hey penny wow look at you all ready for your showcase you look great
thanks i just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium
you know i got to tell you a lot of friends would let their friend go alone but that’s not who you are you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to
i don’t know what to say
well uh penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of rent which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by dr emile farminfarmian
wait a minute farminfarmian is speaking and you’re bogarding the symposium
i don’t know what to say
no it’s okay it’s your millenium falcon you and chewbacca do whatever you want to do me and princess leia here will find some other way to spend the evening
howard wait sheldon i think we should tell them
okay sure i don’t see a problem with that
there’s no symposium leonard lied to me isn’t that right leonard
well… i don’t know what to say
it’s okay i do look leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis he made up the whole story about the symposium with dr farminfarm…ian
hah yeah because he didn’t want sheldon to be embarrassed and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay every family in america has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner
no i’m lost too i think she skipped a step
no look sheldon’s cousin leo escaped rehab and he’s in a motel 8 at long beach the whole family’s going out for an intervention leonard is driving sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man
so road trip to long beach
no we’re not going to long beach
because sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin leopold
oh too bad i’ve always wanted to go to long beach
it’s a very nice community the queen mary is docked there once the largest ocean liner in the world it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner
no no no leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front and even then it’s iffy
wait are we really going to long beach
knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard…
let it go sheldon the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not
no that’s the least of our worries i’ve been doing some research on addiction both the biochemical and behavioural aspects and i think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie
what are you talking about it’s fine she bought it it’s over
sadly it’s not substance abuse is a lifelong struggle but beyond that i have realised that the leo i described would not have agreed to go to rehab
because leo is a middle child
there is no leo how can you say that
you didn’t read the bio did you he’s not just a middle child he’s the quintessential middle child from a broken home to boot psychologically speaking the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of selfdestruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab
fine he leaves a moment later he comes back i’ve hesitated to point this out but i must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit i’m just trying to clean up after your mess leonard throws a glass ornament at him he just manages to shut the door in time we’ll talk in the morning
oh god sheldon does not have a cousin leo
au contraire i’m 26 years old i’m originally from reads off crib notes denton texas but i was a navy brat so i was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world as a result i’ve often felt like an outsider never really fitting in which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem
excuse me we just went over this as the quintessential middle child your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention
oh sheldon are we really going to go with pop psychology
for your information this is all based on solid research stick with the character profile i wrote for you
i’m sorry leonard this is toby loobenfeld he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab but he also minored in theatre at mit
it was more of a double major actually theatre and physics you can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards
yeah i got it sheldon why
well you see while leo would not have gone into rehab it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us
sheldon how about this as my motivation when i was fourteen years old i was abused in the philippines by a club footed navy chaplain
no we’re going with middle child and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production
swell how do i play genetic predisposition
subtextually of course there is a knock on the door just have fun with it opening door morning penny
hi how did the intervention go
unfortunately we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab
well based on what you told me i’m not surprised
but we did convince him to leave the motel come say hello leo this is penny our friend and neighbour
hi leo how are you feeling
let me ask you something penny have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel covered in your own vomit next to a transsexual prostitute
then don’t ask me how i’m feeling
well that’s leo hey um why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night
oh it was okay i guess wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it
there were only two people there
the philippines 1992 the subic bay naval station a young boy on the cusp of manhood his only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful loving god but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat what choice did he have but to drink shoot and snort his pain away
don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction
how could there be a double blind study who would be the control group
as you can see detoxing can get pretty ugly let’s give them some privacy
yeah hey do you want to come over to my place have coffee
i have a video of me singing last night do you want to see it
this is even better than you coming to the showcase because now i get to watch you watch me
yeah funny how things work out
and that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide
your parents made the right decision
this is amazing just sitting on a couch watching tv with a woman not being drunk or high or… or… wondering if you’re a dude down there
leo you are a very sweet really funny guy you’re gonna do okay
one day at a time penny one day at a time
how long is he going to stay here
he’s a homeless drug addict leonard where is he going to go boy you have a lot to learn about lying
obviously you’re not well suited for threedimensional chess perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed
it must be humbling to suck on so many different levels
yeah right here how was nebraska
oh better than north dakota pause i guess that joke’s only funny in nebraska
from the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion all you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here
boy it’s good to be back
ugh it was the worst trip everyone got sick over the weekend
i don’t need you to guess i need you to know now when did the symptoms first appear
friday was that morning or afternoon
think woman who blew their nose and when
sheldon relax she doesn’t have any symptoms i’m sure she’s not contagious
oh please if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago somewhere between tool using and cave painting homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose
penny you’ll have to excuse sheldon he’s a bit of a germophobe
thanks for your consideration now please leave
you’d better go before he starts spraying you with lysol
okay well thank you for getting my mail
no problem welcome home sees penny out turns to find sheldon spraying the air with lysol
what the hell are you doing
i’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures
i need a growth medium and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt here swab my throat
leonard if i’m going to get ahead of this thing i need to find out what’s growing in my throat
sheldon you are not sick this is but you are not
we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny has introduced into our environment and having never been to nebraska i’m fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibodies
sheldon don’t you think you’re overreacting
when i’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance
wait handing him a measuring jug put this in the bathroom
i need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down
i mix pancake batter in this
no that measuring cup has always been for urine
you had time to make a label for everything in this apartment including the label maker but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup
it’s right here on the bottom
huh i guess i owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology
oh dear god shouting leonard leonard i’m sick
leonard leonard leonard leonard my comforter fell down and my sinuses hurt when i bend over leonard bends to get phone ow
they asked me to come in
well i didn’t hear the phone ring
well as i predicted i am sick my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am and i am producing sputum at an alarming rate
no not only that it has shifted from clear to milky green
alright well get some rest and drink plenty of fluids
what else would i drink gasses solids ionised plasma
i’m at work sheldon a woman enters the apartment building with a barking dog
yes they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists i have to go
i know it’s the phone ma i hear the phone
well who’s calling at this ungodly hour
well ask them why they’re calling at this ungodly hour
how can i ask them when i’m talking to you into phone hello
howard it’s leonard code milky green
for god’s sake ma i’m twenty six years old
excuse me mr grownup whaddaya want for breakfast
howard’s sleeping this is his mother why are you calling at this ungodly hour
then call your own mother to leonard it was sheldon
it’s my own fault i forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ’06
you call koothrappali we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours
stand by ma can my friends come over
i just had the carpets steamed
that’s a negatory but there’s a planet of the apes marathon at the new art today
five movies two hours apiece it’s a start
homeless crazy guy at table eighteen
no just crazy sheldon what are you doing here
i’m sick thank you very much
how could you have gotten it from me i’m not sick
you’re a carrier all these people here are doomed you’re doomed
shhh sheldon what do you want
why didn’t you just… louder throat clearance why didn’t you just have soup at home
penny i have an iq of 187 don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home i would have thought of it
i did not think of that clearly febrile delirium is setting in please bring me some soup while i still understand what a spoon is for
okay what kind of soup do you want
well my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons
we have chicken tortilla and potato leek
can i get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons
then surprise me blows nose into handkerchief shows it to next table would you call that moss green or forest green
look at this everyone went chimp
well i’d like to point out i voted for orangutan but you shouted me down phone rings
i’m… uh… in a… i’m in a radiation suit what’s up
yeah well i’m at work too and you’ll never guess who’s here infecting my entire station
sheldon’s at the cheesecake factory into phone just tell him to go home
he won’t leave he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs
he’s paranoid and he’s established a nest
can you please come get him
uh yeah i’d be… i’d be happy to penny holds phone up howard makes warning siren noises oh my god there’s a breech in the radiation unit raj joins in the whole city is in jeopardy oh my god professor googenfeil is melting gotta go bye to howard and raj i feel really guilty
you did what you had to do steals some of howard’s popcorn
take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape
oh it’s okay i didn’t really need to work today it’s not like i have rent or car payments or anything
um home to write some bad cheques
sheldon you are a grown man haven’t you ever been sick before
well of course but not by myself
well once when i was fifteen and spending the summer at the heidelberg institute in germany
no visiting professor anyway the local cuisine was a little more sausagebased than i’m used to and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia
and there was noone there to take care of you
no no my mum had to fly back to texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again
it was tornado season and it was an aluminium house anyway the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any english when i finally managed to convince her i was sick she said “möchtest du eine darmspülung”
based on what happened next i assume it means “would you like an enema”
okay sweetie i’ll take care of you what do you need
well my mom used to give me sponge baths
okay ground rules no sponge baths and definitely no enemas
here we go ten and a half hours of apey goodness
oh dammit my glasses okay i’m blind here guys can you help me find them
sorry don’t you have a spare
well if you leave now you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of charlton heston
unless sheldon’s there in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snotweb
hi penny i was wondering is sheldon still at the restaurant okay that was very nice of you okay gotta go got kind of a full blown chernobyl thing here gotta go bye to howard he’s home i’m screwed ten and a half hours of apey blurriness
you want me to get eye surgery
would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with sheldon or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam
okay nice and cosy okay i’ll see you later
wait will you please rub this on my chest
oh sheldon can’t you do that yourself
vaporub makes my hands smell funny
please please please please please please please
i can’t believe i’m doing this
no no counterclockwise or my chest hair mats
my mom used to sing it to me when i was sick
i’m sorry honey i don’t know it
i’ll teach you “soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr” now you
little ball of fur keep rubbing
what do you see what do you see
the living room appears to be empty
okay he must be in his bedroom my spare glasses are in my bedroom on my dresser next to my batsignal
well i can’t do it i can’t see anything
it’s all right wireless minicam and bluetooth headset we’ll be your eyes
one more thing this is a subsonic impact sensor if sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop at that point based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon you’ll have seven seconds to get out glasses or no glasses
won’t my footsteps set it off
no you’ll be on your hands and knees now you’ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldon’s room
well how do i carry it if i’m on my hands and knees
stay low bear left now keep true
you don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings you say keep true
alright bangs head on a trunk i just hit my head
because you didn’t keep true time shift leonard is now outside bedrooms okay turn right
angle your head to the right a little more a little more leonard now has his head at right angles to his body that’s it now just keep true alright you’re close enough to sheldon’s room deploy the sensor now turn it on
then why did i have to crawl
good from this point forward you will have to crawl
hang on the sensor’s picking up something turn your head back camera angle shows a pair of female legs
told you the sensor would work
you deliberately stuck me with sheldon
well i had to you see what he’s like
uh it’s okay sweetie good news leonard’s home
here you go good luck bye
wait penny take me with you runs after her and bumps into pillar falls semiconscious to the floor  sheldon appears in his comforter
do you think penny will come here and take care of us
i don’t think penny’s ever coming here again
can you go to the kitchen and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus
under the sink yellow tupperware bowl
assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have actually transported the individual you would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another
personally i would never use a transporter because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon
would the new sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old sheldon
no he would be exactly the same
gentlemen i’d like you to meet dennis kim dennis is a highly sought after doctorial candidate and we’re hoping to have him do his graduate work here
and he’s only fifteen years old
not bad i myself started graduate school at fourteen
well i lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of north korea
i thought maybe you boys could show dennis around let him see why we’re the best physics research facility in the country
i already know you’re not you don’t have an open science grid computer or a free electron laser and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end
excuse me that is my research and it is by no means a dead end
well obviously you don’t see it yet but trust me you will
dennis we discussed this we’re in the process of updating our equipment and we welcome your input on our research goals and we’ve agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20 of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of pyongyang we want him here boys make it happen
you can count on us we’re on it what the hell do you mean dead end
i mean the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the fivehundredth power in addition… ooh look chocolate milk
i sense a disturbance in the force
a bad feeling i have about this mmmhmmm
so dennis how long have you been in america
no kidding you speak english really well
so do you except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions
he’s not wrong alright and this is my office
is this part of the tour
come on sheldon we’ve hardly shown him anything
oh alright this is my desk these are my books this is my door please close it behind you goodbye
looks like you’re doing work in quantum loop corrections
you see where you went wrong don’t you
come on dennis i’ll show you the rec centre they’ve got nautilus equipment
do i look like i lift weights
it’s startling to me you haven’t considered a lorentz invariant field theory approach
you think i haven’t considered it you really think i haven’t considered it
come on dennis i’ll show you the radiation lab
wow you won the stephenson award
yes in fact i am the youngest person ever to win it
you were the youngest person ever to win it
it’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror isn’t it
mmm this is really delicious isn’t it raj looks uncomfortable then nods still can’t talk to me unless you’re drunk huh shakes head oh sweetie you are so damaged
hey i’m damaged too how about a hug for howie
something you’d like to share a tale of woe perhaps
fifteen years old dennis kim is fifteen years old and he’s already correcting my work today i went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart to… you know that other guy
oh god now even you’re smarter than me
you know sheldon you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them
just eat sheldon you’ll feel better
why waste food in texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes
i’m confused did sheldon stop giving milk
you can’t let this kid get to you you always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter
yes but i assumed i would have been dead hundreds of years and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg
so you’ve got a bit of competition i really don’t see what the big deal is
well of course you don’t you’ve never excelled at anything
i don’t understand exactly how did he get any friends in the first place
well what are you going to do sheldon give up
yes that’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a postpubescent asian wunderkind he ceases his fruitless efforts he donates his body to scientific research and he waits to die
you know i’m confused again is he waiting or do we get to shoot him between the eyes
i’ve decided you’re right my career is not over
but since the arrival of dennis kim has rendered my research pointless i just have to find something else to focus on
so i’ve decided i’m going to collaborate with you
what exactly is it you do i know you chatter on about it all the time but i’ve never really paid attention
okay well right now i’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sealevel but i really don’t need any help
oh sure you do now see what’s this here in the schematic is that a laser array
no hmmm what happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon
pretty sure’s not very scientific is this how you normally work just hunches and guesses and stuff
okay sheldon i understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but i need to tell you something and i want you to listen carefully
if you’re concerned about sharing credit with me you’re name can go first… i’m going
it’s a small brown paper bag ma i’m looking at it right now pause why would i make that up there’s no dingdong in it pause how are two dingdongs tomorrow going to help me today
engineering where the noble semiskilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream hello oompahloompahs of science
sheldon what are you doing here
i just came by to say hello
i’ve been at this lab for three years you’ve never came by to say hello
well up until now i’ve had better things to do so what are we making today
a small payload support structure for a european science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle
when this is done it will be attached to the payload bay and the sensor apparatus will rest on it
uh huh so it’s a shelf
no you don’t understand during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah okay it’s a shelf
now i notice you’re using titanium did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes they’re lighter cheaper and half twice the tensile strength
sheldon there’s a diploma in my office that says i have a masters in engineering
and you also have a note from your mother that says i love you bubbula but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes
did leonard tell you to say that
no i thought of it all by myself
huh it can’t be a coincidence there must be some causal link i’m missing
if he were i wouldn’t be
do you know what he did he watched me work for ten minutes and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me
something’s got to be done about him leonard
like what he’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen yearold kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is
well what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to sheldon
then our problem would be solved
hang on are we talking about murdering dennis kim i’m not saying no
we don’t have to go that far there are other means available
we can’t send him back to north korea he knows how to get out
the only thing we need to do is make this kim kid lose his focus
that won’t happen he’s not interested in anything but physics
you know biology the one thing that can completely derail a world class mind
yeah so when i was fifteen i met denise polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 50 to a 18
no i just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did
oh good you’re all here look i’ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re working on and join me we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade twelve years tops they stare at him go away they nod hmm could it be me
we need a hot fifteen yearold asian girl with a thing for smart guys
howard that’s racist any fifteen yearold girl will do the trick penny slams door
it’s possible she may have misunderstood us
dr cooper oh are we interrupting
no no please come in yeah i think you’ll appreciate this very exciting
oh what are you working on
something remarkable since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics have disappeared thank you very much i’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the nobel peace prize look i’m going to solve the middleeast crisis by building an exact replica of jerusalem in the middle of the mexican desert
you know it’s like the baseball movie build it and they will come
we’ll make it nice put out a spread
okay well um speaking of spreads we’re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for mr kim who’s agreed to join us here at the university
of course he has the oracle told us little neo was the one you can see the matrix can’t you
okay well uh obviously you’re very busy with your… uh um come dennis you’ll have to excuse dr cooper he’s been under a lot of… um… he’s nuts
ah lalala hava nagila they’ll come they’ll settle and i’ll win the prize…
i really don’t understand your objections professor goldfarb why wouldn’t the senoran desert make a perfectly good promised land
we could call it nuevo cherusalem
why are all these young women here
it’s take your daughter to work day
really i was not aware of that
oh yes there was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16
there’s the man of the hour
okay so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive ageappropriate women
all he has to do now is hook up with one of them the look at dennis who is picking his ear
does anyone else see the flaw in this plan
like what we can’t get fifteen yearold girls drunk
i don’t think you mean we can’t i think you mean we shouldn’t
hey howard you’re a jew if there was another wailing wall exactly like the one in jerusalem but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs would you still be able to wail at it okay it’s definitely me
okay we cannot leave this to chance lets pick a girl and figure out how to get her together with dennis
uhuh i know the type cheerleader student council goes out with jocks won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme and if after two years of begging she does agree to go out with you it turns out to be a setup and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you
sure if he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with nonfat white russians while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you and they she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you
okay so not her either how about her
interesting kind of pretty a little chubby so probably low selfesteem
i think that’s our girl one of us should go talk to her
i can’t talk to her you do it
i can’t just go up and talk to her howard you talk to her
oh no she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this
you know if we were in india this would be simpler five minutes with her dad twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done
alright why don’t we do it your way then we’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end
could i have everyone’s attention please what a wonderful occasion this is and how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day we’re here to welcome mr dennis kim to our little family
mr kim was not only the valedictorian at stamford university he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious stephenson award
youngest till the cyborgs rise up
and now without any further ado let me introduce the man of the hour mr dennis kim dennis dennis
would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research
um no thanks i’m going to the mall with emma
did anyone see how he did it
don’t worry i’ve got this ladies and gentlemen honoured daughters while mr kim by virtue of his youth and naivety has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me thank you
forget the mission how did that little yutz get a girl on his own
i guess times have changed since we were young smart is the new sexy
well why do we go home alone every night we’re still smart
maybe we’re too smart so smart it’s offputting
unbelievable components i built are on the international space station and i get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park
i don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me i have a rocket in my pants”
hey look at that there is a group of youngsters on the grass laying about one is playing a guitar dennis kim is among them he is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag it’s dennis kim
wow i almost didn’t recognise him
you know i kind of feel bad about what we did to him dennis is now snogging the face off emma
yeah we really ruined his life
ooh more details about the new star trek film there’s going to be a scene depicting spock’s birth
i’d be more interested in a scene depicting spock’s conception
oh please for vulcans mating or if you will pon farr it’s an extremely private matter
still i’d like to know the details his mother was human his father was vulcan they couldn’t just conceive
maybe they had to go to a clinic imagine spock’s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears
how come on star trek everybody’s private parts are the same no alien lady ever told captain kirk hey get your thing out of my nose
hi can you help me i was writing an email and the a key got stuck now it’s just going “aaaaaaa”
what did you spill on it
nothing diet coke and yoghurt a little nail polish
i’ll take a look at it
gentlemen switching to local nerd news fishman chen chowdry mcnair aren’t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year
they formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig playing knotsbury farm
wow so in your world you’re like the cool guys
this is our year with those guys out the entire physics bowl will kneel before zod
good story clasps hands to mouth in shock
you want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition would you ask picasso to play pictionary would you ask noah webster to play boggle would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish
come on you need a four person team we’re four people
by that reasoning we should also play bridge hold up a chuppah and enter the olympic bobsled competition
i want tickets to that please
sheldon what do i need to quote spock’s dying words to you
outweigh the needs of the few
or the one dammit i’ll do it
okay first order of physics bowl business we need a truly kickass team name suggestions
how about the perpetual motion squad it’s beyond the laws of physics plus a little heads up for the ladies
perpetual motion squad we can go all night
i don’t teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures thus intimidating ones opponent
then we can be the bengal tigers
poor choice gram for gram no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant
maybe so but you can’t incinerate a bengal tiger with a magnifying glass
let’s put it to a vote all those in favour…
point of order i move that any vote on team names should be unanimous no man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger when common sense dictates it should be an army ant
will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question
after we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes all of which the gentleman will lose does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way
i move we are the army ants all those in favour
good afternoon and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round i’m penny and i’ll be your host because apparently i didn’t have anything else to do on a saturday afternoon and isn’t that just a little sad gentlemen are you ready
fire away raj puts his thumb up
you know it’s none of my business but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little
oh uh he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd he only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice
oh thanks raj it’s vanilla oil
i was actually the one who noticed okay let’s just start
okay the first question is on the topic of optics what is the shortest light pulse ever produced dr cooper
and of course the answer is 130 adoseconds
good for you sweetie okay next question what is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives howard
and of course the answer is giant magneto resistance
but i answered it’s called teamwork
don’t you think i should answer the engineering questions i am an engineer
by that logic i should answer all the anthropology questions because i’m a mammal
okay what artificial satellite has seen glimpses of einsteins predicted frame dragging raj buzzes
and of course it’s gravity probe b
sheldon you have to let somebody else answer
what do manners have to do with it this is war were the romans polite when they salted the ground of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again
leonard you said i only had to ask questions
the objective of the competition is to give correct answers if i know them why shouldn’t i give them
some of us might have the correct answers too
oh please you don’t even have a phd
maybe we should take a little break
good idea i need my wrist brace all this button pushing is aggravating my old nintendo injury
he compared sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve
yeah and the bag it came in
leonard excellent i want to show you something
can it wait i need to talk to you
just look i’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team the colours are based on star trek the original series the three of you will wear support red and i will wear command gold
isn’t that confusing aa might mean something else to certain people
why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium
no i meant… never mind hey check it out i got you a batman cookie jar
well you’re a friend and you like batman and cookies and you’re off the team
howard raj and i just had a team meeting
yes we did i just came from it
okay i don’t know where you just came from but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because i’m on the team and i wasn’t there ergo the team did not meet
okay let me try it this way uh i was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team
because you’re taking all the fun out of it
well i’m sorry is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun
okay let me try it this way you’re annoying and noone wants to play with you any more
i see well at this point i should inform you that i intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears
so who’d he get to be on his team
he won’t say he just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar
he’s using psychological warfare we must reply in kind i say we wait until he looks at us then laugh like yes you are a smart and strong competitor but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you
how exactly would that laugh go
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee
that sounds more like we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians
guys let’s remember that sheldon is still our friend and my room mate
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee
okay we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team
you know who’s apparently very smart is the girl who played tv’s blossom she got a phd in neuroscience or something
raj we’re not getting tv’s blossom to join our physics bowl team
how about the girl from the wonder years
gentlemen i believe i’ve found the solution to all our problems
why because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney
sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team
fine here i go taking one for the team in the sack hey leslie
leslie i have a question for you and it might be a little awkward you know given that i…
leonard there’s no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we’ve seen each other’s faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus
there’s not gee cos it sure sounds like there should be
rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences your idiosyncrasies your performance are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom
that’s all very comforting but if it’s okay i’d like to get on with my question now
we are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team
no thanks i’m really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search
well we tried just have to face sheldon manoemanoemano amano
wait you’re going up against sheldon cooper
that arrogant misogynistic easttexas doorknob that told me i should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing
so how do you feel nice and loose come to play got your game face on the guys look confused are you ready
oh yeah you know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing
oh no no i want to it sounds really interesting
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee
sheldon i’m just going to sit down
actually i don’t need a team i could easily defeat you singlehandedly but the rules require four so may i introduce the third floor janitor he lady from the lunchroom and my spanish is not good either her son or her butcher and what about your team what rat have you recruited to the ss sinking ship
yeah leslie winkle the answer to the question who made sheldon cooper cry like a little girl
yes well i’m polymerised tree sap and you’re nonorganic adhesive so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you
here’s your teeshirt hands her a teeshirt with pms on it takes jacket off to reveal similar
pms it’s a couple of days early but…
no it stands for perpetual motion squad
oh right of course what was i thinking
good afternoon everyone and welcome to this year’s physics bowl today’s preliminary match features two great teams… aa versus pms
all night long y’all stands and turns round to reveal the back of the teeshirt which reads “we can go all night”
okay well let’s jump right in first question for ten points what is the isospan singlet partner of the pi zero meson buzz pms
the velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt
denied alright for ten points what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope buzz aa
and of course the answer is technetium
terrific next question what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation buzz pms
sheldon can suck on the casimir effect
how does a quantum computer factor large numbers buzz pms
41855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie
lamda equals one over pi r squared n
760 degrees celsius the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row
mr wolowitz this is your second warning
yes assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth
correct ladies and gentlemen i hold in my hand the final question the score now stands aa 1150 pms 1175 so for one hundred points and the match please turn your attention to the formula on the screens solve the equation
it looks like something they found on the ship at roswell
leonard it’s not going to work if you rush me you have to let me get there
you’re never going to let that go are you
um eight gablehouser stares at him point four
i’m sorry that’s incorrect aa if you can answer correctly the match is yours
he doesn’t have it he’s got squat
aa i need your answer buzz
the answer is minus eight by alpha
hang on hang on a second that’s not our answer what are you doing
how do you know anything about physics
here i am janitor in former soviet union i am physicist leningrad politechnica go polar bears
well that’s a delightful little story but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything i answer the questions
hey look now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved russia but on this physics bowl team i rule with an iron fist makes fist in the air ow
aa i need your official answer
well it’s not what he said
you can’t have a different question
denied i need your official answer
no i decline to provide one
well that’s too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct
alright the winner of the match is…
hang on sheldon is proving that you are singlehandedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team
that trophy is meaningless i forfeited therefore you did not win
i know someone who would disagree
my physics bowl trophy in weird voice “leonard is so smart sheldon who”
you’re right i’m sorry in voice waving trophy in sheldon’s face i’m not
i’m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here okay are you ready
okay marsha jan and cindy were the three daughters of what tv family they stare at her the brady bunch okay sammy hagar replaced david lee roth as the lead singer in what group
van halen alright madonna was married to this ridgemont high alum pause oh my god sean penn
how do you know these things
i go outside and i talk to people alright here what actor holds the record for being named people magazine’s sexiest man alive
wait i don’t think it’s shatner
then it’s got to be patrick stewart
alright singer who sang “oops i did it again” sheldon starts involuntarily twitching again okay tweetie bird taught he taw a what
yes he taught he taw a romulan
well this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster i asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat
turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat it’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order in a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash
i know it’s basic culinary science
some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and noone is bidding on it
a time machine from the movie the time machine
no a time machine from sophie’s choice
boy sophie could have used a time machine in that movie did you see it it’s rough
it was a spur of the moment thing i figured it would go for thousands and i just wanted to be a part of it
there’s only 30 seconds left in the auction
not to blow on a miniature time machine
don’t worry the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid and then they swoop in and get it it’s called sniping
congratulations you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine
i wonder why noone else bid this is a classic piece of scifi movie memorabilia
yeah i know i still can’t afford it
why don’t we share it we’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes
a time share time machine i’m in sheldon
need you ask but i still don’t understand why noone else bid
i understand why noone else bid
did the listing actually say miniature
i just assumed who sells a full sized time machine for 800
in a venn diagram that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need 800”
it’s actually a tremendous bargain even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound
how are we going to get it upstairs
if we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator
yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years
i’ve been meaning to ask you do you think we should make a call about that
not necessary i have a masters in engineering i remotely repair satellites on a regular basis i troubleshoot space shuttle payloads when the mars rover started pulling to the left i performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away presses lift button nothing happens no that baby’s broken
if i push any harder i’m going to give birth to my colon
i can’t feel my fingers hurry up
it’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go basic physics
if my fingers ever work again i’ve got a job for the middle one
uh hi penny raj and howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs take a break guys
oh just you know moving… something upstairs
yeah okay neat but i really got to get to work so…
uh just give us a few minutes
i don’t have a few minutes i’m running really late
then i have a simple solution go up to the roof hop over to the next building there’s a small gap don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo and use their stairwell
oh i never joke when it comes to vertigo
damn okay i’ll just take the roof
hey if you wait for us to set up the time machine i can drop you off at work yesterday time travel joke it’s not… never mind
for what it’s worth i thought it was humorous
let’s just do this guys ready to push
in a minute howard stepped outside to throw up
i don’t know what you were worried about i think it really works in the room
yeah it is by far the coolest thing i have ever owned
the exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor from victorian england into the postapocalyptic future which society had splintered into two factions the subterranean morlocks who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling eloy
oh yeah the guy who lives next to me is always like i have a jacuzzi on my balcony i have a jacuzzi on my balcony but wait until i tell him i’ve got a time machine on my balcony stuff that in your speedos jacuzzi bob
gentlemen i know we said we’d take turns but i think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here
you can’t just keep it here what if i meet a girl and say “you wanna come up and see my time machine it’s at my friends house” how lame is that
alright i think we’re going to need some ground rules in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine i propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine
i was going to put down a towel
i still want it on my balcony i say we move it on a bimonthly basis
hold on bimonthly is an ambiguous term do you mean move it every other month or twice a month
sheldon you can’t be selfish we all paid for it so it belongs to all of us now out of the way so i can sit in my time machine sits and turns it on the three lights on the front illuminate all let out an “oh” okay i am setting the dials for march 10th 1876
good choice alexander graham bell invents the telephone and calls out for dr watson
wait a minute i’d want to see that too
so when it’s your turn you can
but if we all go back to the same point in time bell’s lab is going to get very crowded he’ll know something’s up
also since the time machine doesn’t move in space you’ll end up in 1876 pasadena
and even if you can make it to boston what are you going to do knock on the door and say to mrs bell “hey mrs bell big fan of your husband can i come in and watch him invent the telephone”
mrs bell was deaf she’s not even going to hear you knock
oh i have a solution first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device
ooh how far into the future
if i remember correctly captain kirk will steal a cloaking device from the romulans on stardate 50273 which will be january 10th 2328 by prefederation reckoning
okay i am setting the dials for january 10th 2328 here we go into the future pulls lever the disk begins to spin the other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion that was fun
okay first of all what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide i slipped and skinned my knee
zzzzzzzzz second of all the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked so i had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely armenian family who insisted i stay for lunch
it was eight courses of lamb and they tried to fix me up with their son
not done by the time i finally got to work they’d given my shift away yeah that’s right i’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…
the lights flash and the dish spins you wanna try it
no i don’t want to try it my god you are grown men how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…
oh please it’s not a time machine if anything it looks like something elton john would drive through the everglades
it only moves in time it would be worse than useless in a swamp
pathetic all of you completely pathetic storms out a beat and then…
leonard it’s two in the morning
so it’s my turn why did you set it for the day before yesterday
because i want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine
you can’t if you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it ergo you would still have it this is a classic rookie time travel mistake
can i go back and prevent you from explaining that to me
same paradox if you were to travel back in time and say knock me unconscious you would not then have the conversation that irritated you motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious
what if i knocked you unconscious right now
but it would make the present so much nicer
well it was a number of things first the late hour then your demeanour seems very low energy plus your irritability…
oh i don’t usually pick up on those things good for me
oh wait did you want to talk about what’s bothering you
uh here’s the thing girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines
i disagree your inability to successfully woo penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine that failure clearly stands on its own
in addition your premise is flawed in the original film rod taylor got yvette mimeaux with that very time machine in back to the future marty mcfly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother
well of course they’re movies were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine that’s absurd
if i push any harder i’m going to give birth to my colon
uh hi penny raj and howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs take a break guys
oh just you know moving a… time machine
yeah okay neat but i really got to get to work so…
no problem removes glasses pulls down out of order tape from lift doors and forces them open hang on takes penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable
but what about your time machine
some things are more important than toys she puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable
don’t worry baby i’ve got you
oh leonard kisses him as they descend from view leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine
i’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell
well is that really necessary if you need money you can always sell blood and semen
lox and bagels the breakfast of time travellers
terrific does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine
because i don’t want it any more
my spideysense tells me this has something to do with penny
look do you want to buy me out or not
i’ll give you a hundred dollars which will make me half owner and we’ll put it on my balcony
screw his balcony i’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage
i paid two hundred dollars for my share
dude everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot
i’ll go for two hundred that time machine stays right where it is
three hundred and i’ll throw in my original 1979 mattel millenium falcon with real light speed sound effects
no no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or darth vader voice changers i’m getting rid of all of it
you can’t do that look what you’ve created here it’s like nerdvana
more importantly you’ve a darth vader voice changer
oh i call dibs on the golden age flash
hang on i need that to complete my justice society of america collection
well you can’t just call dibs
i can and i did look up dibs on wikipedia
dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war
it’s not a bidding war i’m selling it all to larry down at the comic book store
why larry did larry call dibs
he offered me a fair price for the whole collection
what’s the number i’ll match it
i’ll match it plus a thousand rupees
none of your business take it or leave it
mom my barmizvah bonds how much do i got thanks i can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in israel
forget it guys if i sell to one of you the other two are going to be really mad at me
who cares as long as you pick me
okay leonard put down the box let’s talk
sorry raj my mind is made up
no i can’t let you do this
sheldon get out of my way
okay i did not want to do this but i have here the rare mint condition production error star trek
okay man be cool we’re all friends here
little miss “grown ups don’t play with toys” if i were to go into that apartment right now would i find beanie babies are you not an accumulator of care bears and my little ponies and who is that japanese feline i see frolicking on your shorts hellohello kitty
okay okay look if this is about yesterday leonard i am really sorry about what i said i was just a bit upset
no i needed to hear it
no you didn’t look you are a great guy and it is things you love that make you who you are
i guess that makes me large breasts
still i think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life
oh wow good for you kisses his cheek
thanks hey do you want to i don’t know later…
yeah i just have to change
my turn on the time machine
it worked it really worked they said i was mad but it worked large hairy creatures with glowing eyes emerge from the forest and walk towards him menacingly oh no not morlocks not flesheating morlocks heeeeeeeelp with a yelp he wakes up in the time machine in the living room
we have to get rid of the time machine
it is a little big for the living room isn’t it
yeah that’s the problem it’s too big
i’m glad you agree i hired some guys to help us move it come on in fellas a pair of morlocks come through the door
oh no morlocks eat him eat him aaaaargh sheldon wakes up in his own bed leonard
on the other hand some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works it will create a black hole and swallow up the earth ending life as we know it
psh what a bunch of crybabies no guts no glory man
hey check it out the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers
we are testing a new medication for social anxiety panic attacks agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder why would they be looking for test subjects here
i don’t know raj maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board sees crowds in the corridor what’s going on
shhh hot girl in sheldon’s office
don’t think so i followed her here from the parking lot
well she’s free to examine my briefs
i know i’m disgusting i should be punished by her oh look i did it again
thank you for coming by he rises from his desk everyone rushes to look nonchalant hello
sorry i’m late i’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle
how can you be late i wasn’t expecting you at all
nobody ever expects me sometimes you just look and… bam shakes girl’s hand howard wolowitz
sheldon are you going to introduce us
oh alright this is missy missy this is leonard and rajesh and you’ve already met howard
so how do you two know each other
oh he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head
she’s my twin sister she thinks she’s funny but frankly i’ve never been able to see it
it’s because you have no measurable sense of humour shelly
how exactly would one measure a sense of humour a humourmometer
well i think you’re delightfully droll or as the french say tres drole
okay so let me see if i got this leonard howard and… i’m sorry what was your name again raj looks uncomfortable turns and walks away disappears round corner he then reappears takes the orange paper from the noticeboard and leaves again
so missy what brings you all the way from texas
was it perhaps destiny i think it was destiny
my friend’s getting married in disneyland tomorrow night
and i had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dad’s estate
the papers could have been mailed mom just sent you here to spy on me didn’t she
i guess that’s why they call you a genius
they call me a genius because i’m a genius tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds and that i’m having regular bowel movements enjoy the wedding goodbye
if the wedding’s not until tomorrow why don’t you stay with us tonight
oh i don’t think so shelly doesn’t like company even as a little boy he’d send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day
they were not friends they were imaginary colleagues
look you’re here we have plenty of room
so what i don’t issue invitations to your mother
well it would be nice not to have to drive out to anaheim in rush hour
and don’t ever call me shelly
so it’s settled you’ll stay with us
i’ll walk you to your car you’re in structure 3 level c right
so anyway we’re eight years old and sheldon converts my easybake oven to some kind of highpowered furnace
i needed a place to fire ceramic semiconductor substrates for homemade integrated circuits
he was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room
made necessary by her insistence on going into my room
anyway i go to make those little corn muffins they give you there’s a big flash next thing you know my eyebrows are gone
yep i had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my mom drew on
is that what that was i just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical
hey leonard you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs
really they have your little name label in them
yeah no i do i use those… uh… just to polish up my… spearfishing equipment i spear fish when i’m not crossbow hunting i spear fish uh penny this is sheldon’s twin sister missy missy this is our neighbour penny
wow you don’t look that much alike
fraternal twins come from two separate eggs they are no more alike than any other siblings
hey guess what i’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness
yes i’m very hopeful hello missy he waves his hand it keeps waving they mentioned there may be side effects
so missy have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india
well there’s dr patel at our church
ah yes dr patel good man
do you like motorcycles ‘cos i ride a hog
a hog you have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front
you still have to wear a helmet
have you ever heard of the kama sutra
the indian sex book in other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love it was us
hey sheldon’s sister’s pretty cute i w…
i didn’t say you were i just said she was cute
oh huh um maybe if you like women who are tall… and perfect
sheldon why are you ignoring your sister
i’m not ignoring my sister i’m ignoring all of you
we indians invented them you’re welcome
yeah well my people invented circumcision you’re welcome
missy i’m going to go get my nails done do you want to come
uh yeah no uh bye penny
okay you two have to back off
why should i back off you back off dude
excuse me this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister
so what you’ve already got penny
how do i have penny in what universe do i have penny
excuse me can i interject something i’m ordering pizza online is everyone okay with pepperoni
sheldon can i talk to you in private
i guess don’t worry i was going to order you cheeseless
that’s okay lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about
i’m a fancy indian man we invented pajamas
hey look at me i don’t have a foreskin
sheldon are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman
hmmm she certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable it’s noteworth that at other points in history heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence
i didn’t say it was fascinating i said it was noteworthy
alright noted but my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister
oh okay you know i don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought
what i’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis
whatever you have to do something about it
i don’t understand yes we shared a uterus for nine months but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways
okay uh… oh consider this with your father gone it is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate
i hadn’t considered that we do share dna
so there is the possibility however remote that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself
exactly and you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring
you’re right if someone wants to get at missy’s fallopian tubes they’ll have to go through me
i am shiva the destroyer i will have the woman
i’m warning you i was judo champion at math camp
alright that’s enough juvenile squabbling stop it stop it i say i’m going to settle this right now neither of you are good enough for my sister
who are you to decide that
he’s the man of his family you have to respect his wishes
you’re out too by the way
it’s nothing personal i’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an eskimo pie
what are you so happy about
i’m not happy it’s the medication i can’t stop smiling waves hand at mouth it keeps waving
now that leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister
wait a minute leonard made you aware of that
we all make mistakes let’s move on
excuse me but i think you’re missing a big opportunity here
everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring why not put a little mocha in the family latte
in principle you have a point but as a practical matter need i remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex
i think you’re focussing entirely too much on the drugs finger keeps waving leonard has to reach out and stop it
is it ‘cause i’m jewish ‘cause i’d kill my rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister
this has nothing to do with religion this has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny tiny man who still lives with his mother
sheldon you are really being unreasonable
am i here eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister
shelly can i speak to you for a minute alone
why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone usually nobody wants to be alone with me
we all make mistakes let’s move on
okay i’m not even going to ask why you’re pimping me out for cheese but since when do you care at all about who i sleep with
truthfully i’ve never given it any thought but it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential
what on earth are you talking about
let me explain you see i’m a superior genetic mutation an improvement on the existing mediocre stock
and what do you mean mediocre stock
that would be you but residing within you is the potential for another me perhaps even taller smarter and less prone to freckling a sheldon 20 if you will
exactly now i am not saying that i should be the sole decider of who you mate with if you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced
you have got to be kidding me
not at all frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation
okay shelly sit down now i’ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is as mom puts it one of god’s special little people
i always thought i was more like a cuckoo bird you know a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death luckily for you that’s where the metaphor ended
i thought it ended at cuckoo now you listen to me if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me then terrific bring it on but you try one time to tell me who i should be sleeping with and you and i are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little remember sheldon hurriedly crosses his legs
you donate eggs we will place them in cryogenic storage i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs have them fertilized and implanted in you that way everybody wins
correction missy can date whoever she wants
look we have to settle this
i agree sheldon’s sister is hiding at penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time
she’s not hiding she needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick oh and then i believe she has to wash her hair
you want to go again let’s go
if we’re going to fight over missy let’s do it the right way the honourable way
come on come on get up
stay down bitch yeah ha ha natural selection at work
excuse me while i go tell missy the good news leaves and knocks on penny’s door
hi penny how’s it going listen that guy mike that you were dating is that still going on
nothing just catching up by the way may i speak to missy please
well since you’re leaving tomorrow i was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me
that’s so sweet but no thanks
oh you have other plans or…
oh alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening
um here’s something we didn’t anticipate
i’m fine thanks for asking i’ve come to call on missy
the amazing howard do you like magic
then you are in for a treat behold an ordinary cane taps against doorpost while humming he tries to perform a trick but the cane falls in half with a yellow handkerchief flying out howard has to retrieve the pieces dadah emerges with the handkerchief on which are written the words “will you go out with me”
okay does something with hands from which another yellow handkerchief emerges this one reads “are you sure” missy closes the door
thank you i apprec… looks panicked apprec… appreeee… ohoh
oh honey is your medication wearing off  raj nods
oh hi cutie pie i was hoping you’d show up
we had a dog who made a noise like that had to put him down
any news you want me to pass along to mom
well she might be interested to know that i have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory
yeah i’ll just tell her you said hey
okay well it was pleasant seeing you other than that business with my testicles holds out hand to shake
come on shelly hugs him he looks uncomfortable then hugs back half heartedly i want you to know i’m very proud of you
yup i’m always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist
you tell people i’m a rocket scientist
my god why don’t you just tell them i’m a toll taker at the golden gate bridge rocket scientist how humiliating
hey guys guys some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something
it combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport
yeah that’s terrific but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out to someone off right come on guys come on singing while approaching another table happy birthday to you happy birthday to you…
we might as well stop it’s a stalemate you’re beating me in tetris but you’ve got the upper body strength of a keebler elf
keebler elf i’ve got your keebler elf right here strains to push sheldon’s arm down tries using both hands still with no effect okay it’s a stalemate
so leonard will we be seeing you on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake
he can’t eat cheesecake he’s lactose intolerant
okay he can have carrot cake
what about the cream cheese frosting
forget about the cake how did you know that my birthday is saturday
i did your horoscope remember i was going to do everybody’s until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants
for the record that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of bertram forer who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum
blah blah blah a typical taurus so seriously are we going to see you saturday
no it’s no big deal it’s just the way i was raised my parents focussed on celebrating achievements and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them
it’s actually based on very sound theories his mother published a paper on it
what was it called “i hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake”
it was obviously effective leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist perhaps if she’d also denied him christmas he’d be a little better at it
well i love birthdays waking up to mom’s special french toast breakfast wearing the birthday king crown playing laser tag with all my friends
yeah see that’s what kids should have
so you’ve really never had a birthday party
no but it was okay i mean when i was little i’d think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party like this one birthday i came home from my cello lesson and i saw a lot of strange cars parked out front and when i got to the door i could hear people whispering and i could smell german chocolate cake which is my favourite
uh it turns out my grandfather had died
oh it was kind of like a birthday party i got to see all my cousins and there was cake so…7
that’s the saddest thing i’ve ever heard
you think go ahead tell her about your senior prom
make sure they remember no peanuts
howard every thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts they see me coming they go “ah no peanut boy”
i know i want to talk to you
what would we talk about we’ve no overlapping areas of interest i’m aware of and you know i don’t care for chitchat
okay can you just let me in
well alright but i don’t see this as a promising endeavour
okay here’s the deal we are going to throw leonard a kickass surprise party for his birthday on saturday
i hardly think so leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party
he just doesn’t know he wants one because he’s never had one
i suppose that’s possible but for the record i’ve never had a threesome and yet i still know i want one
howard here’s the difference the possibility exists that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over
fine if i do have a threesome you can’t be part of it i’m just kidding yes you can can you bring a friend
i think a birthday party is a terrible idea i envy leonard for growing up without that anguish
year after year i had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation
okay sweetie i understand you have scars that no nonprofessional can heal but nevertheless we are going to throw leonard a birthday party
have i pointed out that i am extremely uncomfortable with dancing loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity
in addition i really don’t think that leonard wants a…
okay here’s the deal you either help me throw leonard a birthday party or so help me god i will go into your bedroom and i will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books and on one of them you won’t know which i’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink
you can’t do that if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint
sheldon do you understand the concept of blackmail
well of course i… oh yeah i have an idea let’s throw leonard a kick ass birthday party
that’s not the secret knock this is the secret knock he knocks two one two
the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a nonverbal signal to verify the identity of one’s coconspirators
can you just let us in
luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor
so what did you get the birthday boy
well raj got him an awesome limited edition dark knight sculpture based on alex ross’s definitive batman and i got him this amazing autographed copy of the feynman lectures on physics
nice i got him a sweater
okay well he might like that i’ve seen him… chilly
uh sheldon i didn’t see your present
that’s because i didn’t bring one
the entire institution of gift giving makes no sense
let’s say that i go out and i spend fifty dollars on you it’s a laborious activity because i have to imagine what you need whereas you know what you need now i can simplify things just give you the fifty dollars directly and you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer and i ask you is it worth it
well sheldon you’re his friend friends give each other presents
i accept your premise i reject your conclusion
try telling him it’s a nonoptional social convention
question how am i going to get leonard a present before the party i don’t drive and the only things available within walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station i suppose i could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers
okay let’s do this um i will drive sheldon to get a present and howard you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours
and then raj you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up
stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable
so listen the new art is showing the revised definitive cut of blade runner
no you’ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut this one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage they say it completely changes the tone of the film
come on afterwards there’s a q  a with harrison ford’s body double
look i am in the halo battle of my life here there’s this kid in copenhagen he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 247
can’t you play him some other time
not if you believe his doctors
oh my god do you smell gas
alright you know they have dvds over there
yes but they have dvd burners over here leonard needs a dvd burner
sheldon a gift shouldn’t be something someone needs it should be something fun you know something they wouldn’t buy for themselves
well it’s a fun sweater it’s got a bold geometric print
is it the geometry that makes it fun
okay the point is one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them
okay i see so not a dvd burner
something he wouldn’t buy for himself something fun something like… oh an 80211n wireless router
here you go copenhagen boy how about a taste of hans christian hand grenade raj enters carrying party supplies howard waves him away while in the background leonard is heard saying “oh that did not feel good” come on come on oh you clever little… come on come on take that
this granola bar there’s peanuts in it
oh my god why did you eat it
i don’t know it was just there
well if i had a gun there would you have shot yourself
don’t yell at me i’ve got to go to the emergency room
no after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket
alright um just uh let me get my keys
oh god oh god oh god oh… into phone after leonard leaves room the laundry is out of the hamper looks exasperated okay sheldon what was it supposed to be fine it’s out of the washer i’ll call you when it’s in the dryer
alright let’s go they exit with howard making croaking noises
because of the two additional ethernet ports
he doesn’t need them he’s already got a 640 connect switch
i don’t know the man on the box looks so happy
penny if i’m going to buy leonard a gift i’m going to do it right i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did
oh i know i’m going to regret this but what trauma
on my twelfth birthday i really wanted a titanium centrifuge so you know i could separate radioactive isotopes
instead of a titanium centrifuge my parents bought me… wow this is hard they got me… a motorised dirt bike
what twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike
okay so we’re getting this one
i know everything about this stuff
okay i have my own wholesale flower business and i want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse
here buy this one look it’s the one we’re getting see happy guy available
no no no no she doesn’t want that she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender
it depends on what bus you have
not now penny this poor man needs me to woman approaching you hold on i’ll be right with you what computer do you have and please don’t say a white one
fill this out have a seat
no listen see we’re throwing my friend a surprise party and i’m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours
uhhuh fill this out and have a seat
no see the only way i could get him to leave is to tell him i ate a peanut because i’m allergic to peanuts
oh well in that case fill this out and have a seat
look all i need from you is to take me in the back and give me a bandaid so i can pretend i had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour hour and a half
oh i understand but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid
okay i get it i know how the world works how about if i were to introduce you holding up a five dollar bill to the man who freed your people
hey sorry i couldn’t find a parking spot how are you doing
really ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home
becauth pretends tongue has swollen up becauththth brissket brissket water need water
penny look i’ve got a problem
yeah well so do i look you’ve got to stall leonard a little longer
you have to we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise”
okay you have to understand something we’re in a hospital right now
leonard’s fine i’m fine thanks for asking by the way
okay i don’t need your attitude just hold him there a little longer
look i’ve done my best but he wants to go home and i don’t know how to stop him
okay how about this you keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party i’ll point out which of my friends are easy
i’ve got a hot former fat girl with no selfesteem i’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who’s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat
thy will be done thinks reaches into back pocket finds the half a granola bar from earlier looks down i’m doing this for you little buddy takes a bite
okay we don’t have that in stock but i can special order it for you
excuse me sir you don’t work here
yes well apparently neither does anyone else
well for one thing we’re late for leonard’s birthday party and for another i told him to call security
good luck to assistant by the way a six yearold could hack your computer system
yeah 1234 is not a secure password
excuse me my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts
look sir we are very busy here and i just don’t… sees leonard whose face has swollen all over holy crap
code 4 i need a gurney right away right away
say what you will about the healthcare system in this country but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything
i really don’t think the colonoscopy was necessary
you know before you got all swollen up i actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party
oh right it’s your birthday i had no idea it was your birthday i completely forgot wow what a lousy way to spend a birthday well it’s all over now
there is a party isn’t there
how could i be mad you actually risked your life because you cared about me
yeah that’s why i did it
alright here we go my first birthday party
dude everybody left an hour ago surprise
okay leonard here i am at your birthday party i don’t know where you are dude but it’s really kickass everyone is very very drunk and uh… girl pours booze into his mouth oh look there’s a girl taking her shirt off
that’s my friend carol remind me i’ve got to introduce her to howard
oh sweet krishna shake it thata rupee maker
i’m so sorry you didn’t get your party
happy birthday anyways she kisses him full on the lips
hey penny when uh when’s your birthday
no it’s wo de ming zi shi sheldon makes a hand movement with every syllable
wo de ming zi shi sheldon copies hand movements
that’s what you did i assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase
how am i supposed to know that as the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter
you know i’m really glad you decided to learn mandarin
once you’re fluent you’ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me
you just called leonard a syphilitic donkey
my apologies leonard i’m only as good as my teacher
i believe the szechuan palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them
if i were you i’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken
i need to use your window
oh yeah no sure go ahead
hey jerkface you forgot your ipod throws it out
oh i’ll tell you what’s going on that stupid selfcentred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog out of window drop dead you stupid selfcentred bastard to leonard thank you exit
not now i have a blog to find
i’m fine leonard just go away
look i understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful…
okay feel better bye goes back to apartment she doesn’t want to talk
not surprising penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless leonard stares at him or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk
hey look i found an ipod
it’s smashed beyond repair what are you going to do with it
what else sell it on ebay as slightly used
it was penny’s boyfriend’s they broke up
apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which i cannot find anywhere
you know what i’m going to go back and try talking to her again
good idea sit with her hold her comfort her and if the moment feels right see if you can cop a feel
i’m not going to do that howard
i’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all
twelfth century code of chivalry not exactly current you’d also have to be knighted for that to apply
i don’t care she’s upset i’m going over there
remember to sit on your hands a bit so they’re warm
i’m her friend i’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability
what so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her right there right now you’ll just walk away
i said i’m her friend not her gay friend
hey listen i know you said that you didn’t want to talk…
tell me the truth am i just an idiot who picks giant losers
okay so i pick good guys but turn them into losers
well it’s got to be one or the other which is it
i’m sorry what were the choices again
i really thought mike was different i thought he was sensitive and smart i mean not you smart normal nonfreaky smart
you know and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it
actually it’s not all that easy to find
yeah really well my friends at work found it my sister found it judging by my email a number of prisoners at the michigan state penitentiary found it
okay well what exactly did this guy write not that i need to know the details of your sex life i just thought… never mind
nope you know what you might as well read it everybody else has go ahead oh god i just feel so betrayed and embarrassed i just want to crawl into a hole and die
okay well you know this isn’t that bad it just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales
elevators parks movie theatres out of curiosity is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop
doesn’t that violate the health code
no at the sub shop we were only making out
huh okay but my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed
really do you think i overreacted
‘cause i do that i do overreact maybe i should call mike and apologise
no no no that that would be underreacting he did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and in your case the elevator parks and fast food franchise
yes you’re right i should just say i’m done with him
yes you should go ahead say it
but i never gave the man a chance to explain
what is there to explain it’s all right here it’s a betrayal
no you were right the first time this is a man who loves me but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels
i’m pretty sure i never said that
no you did better than that you helped me see it on my own
aw good for me where are you going
i’m going over to mike’s leonard thank you so much
oh sure huh maybe i am her gay friend
howard i’m going to need another mandarin lesson i obviously didn’t make my point with those people
for god’s sake sheldon if you don’t like the tangerine chicken don’t order the tangerine chicken
i like tangerine chicken i’m not getting tangerine chicken
can we please change the subject
sure tell us again how you screwed up and got penny back together with her old boyfriend
enslaved by warlocks stay here till you roll 2 4 or 6…7
she was mad at him she was done with him the relationship was broken beyond repair and i walked over there and i fixed it
boy that story gets better every time you hear it
actually i thought the first two renditions were far more compelling previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character now i just find him to be whiny and annoying
i’d love to but i don’t have tangerine chicken
thank you so much for your stupid advice slams door again
incredible you managed to screw up the screwup
i’m sorry i yelled at you it’s not your fault
well i went over to mike’s to make up with him
yeah i know i know that part
but he had already moved on
that’s what i said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck
oh penny i am so sorry
oh well you know you did throw an 8 gig ipod… yeah no how could he do that
i swear to god i am done with guys like that you know macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money
yeah that must get old quick
you know just once i would like to go out with someone who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me
what about if you went out with me
um… yes… i am… asking you out
i was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
no i know i got that yeah totally
…thing and honest but it’s no big deal…
yes i will go out with you
yeah why not i mean what do i have to lose
show me your citrus peels gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei show me your citrus peels gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei show me your…
aieee ya xia si wo le
i’m sorry look do you have a second
a second what pair of underwear
i was just wondering if i could talk to you it’s about leonard
why me why not koothrappali or wolowitz
well raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk and wolowitz is you know disgusting
all i’m saying is you know leonard the best
not necessarily i’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard just the other day i discovered he not only has a loofah he hides it why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally but i don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process  time shift and until recently i had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance he can tolerate small amounts of nonfat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that i maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised begins to unlock apartment door
leonard might come home can we talk in my apartment
ach why not we’re already through the looking glass anyway
okay so here’s the thing i guess you’re aware that leonard asked me out
well he didn’t actually say anything but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia
oh that’s nice anyhow the thing i wanted to talk to you about is you know since leonard and i have become friends i was just… want to sit down
oh i wish it were that simple you see i don’t spend much time here and so i’ve never really chosen a place to sit
there are a number of options and i’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice
alright why don’t you just pick one at random and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time
no no that’s crazy you go ahead and talk while i figure it out
okay um here’s the thing so i’ve known for a while now that leonard has had a little crush on me…
a little crush well i suppose so in the same way menelaus had a little crush on helen of troy
alright yeah i don’t really know who they are…
well menelaus was the brother of agamemnon…
yeah i don’t care i don’t care the point is leonard isn’t the kind of guy i usually go out with
leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees
no what i’m saying is leonard might be different in a good way obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well
the last one worked out well for koothrappali he got a free ipod oh glare
but on the other hand if things don’t go well with leonard i risk losing a really good friend i mean i guess he’s not looking for a fling he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for i don’t know like you would say light years
i would not say that noone would say that a light year is a unit of distance not time
draft you see people hear the word year and they think duration foot pound has the same problem that’s a unit of work not of weight
not the first one i’ve made today
okay i think this will be my seat
sheldon do you have anything to say that has anything to do with you know what i’m talking about
well let’s see we might consider schrodinger’s cat
schrodinger is that the woman in 2a
no that’s mrs grossinger and she doesn’t have a cat she has a mexican hairless annoying little animal yip yip yip yip…
sorry you diverted me anyway in 1935 erwin schrodinger in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time now since noone knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead
i’m sorry i don’t get the point
well of course you don’t get it i haven’t made it yet you’d have to be psychic to get it and there’s no such thing as psychic
just like schrodinger’s cat your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad it is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is
okay so you’re saying i should go out with leonard
no no no no no no let me start again in 1935 erwin schrodinger…
chong sho sha pwe caption translates to “long live concrete” xie xie thank you
sheldon i think i’ve made a mistake
i can see that unless you’re planning on running a marathon choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy
a mistake involving penny okay you’ll have to narrow it down
i don’t think i can go out with her tonight
other people would say “why not”
now that i’m actually about to go out with penny i’m not excited i’m nauseous
ah then your meal choice is appropriate starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion
you also made a common grammatical mistake you said nauseous when you meant nauseated but go on
sheldon this date is probably my one chance with penny what happens if i blow it
well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from scooby doo cartoons comes to mind
alright what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion
tell me whether or not to go through with the date
you sound surprised mmm hou zi shui zai li du your monkey sleeps inside me
thank you you look very nice
i made an eight o’clock reservation
okay great listen um maybe we should talk first
oh okay but before you say anything have you ever heard of schrodinger’s cat
actually i’ve heard far too much about schrodinger’s cat
good he grabs her and kisses her
alright the cat’s alive let’s go to dinner
show me your mucus your mucus
this is not a tangerine bicycle
no don’t call the library show me your mucus leonard and penny are seen entering and then leaving again quickly oxen are in my bed many many oxen oy vey
so you see what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures it’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness
it’s also not pink and has no berries
yeah but it doesn’t really answer my question
oh right no i’m lactose intolerant
well good night they kiss camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift leonard spots its movement and shuffles penny away
why don’t we just go into your…
oh yeah you know what maybe we should just slow things down a little
no no i didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast
no i know i… i know what you meant it’s just… it’s only our first date
yeah okay sure no problem why don’t we just figure out where we’re going and when we want to get there and then rate of speed equals distance over time solve for r
or we could just wing it
goodnight he throws the camera a dirty look
oh hey leonard how was your date
bite me sheldon how could you just sit there and let them spy on me
they were clever leonard they exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing
you should thank us when future generations try to determine why your relationship with penny crashed and burned this right here is the black box
what are you talking about the date went fine
dude she said she wants to slow things down
okay so she said she wants to slow things down it’s like saying “i’m really enjoying this meal i’m going to slow down and savour it”
no it’s like “this fish tastes bad so i’m going to slow down and spit it out”
oh really did you make a second date
well we sort of decided to wing it
oh even i know that’s lame
okay alright let’s assume your hypothesis we went to dinner we talked we laughed we kissed where could i have possibly gone wrong
think back leonard the littlest things can set women off like hey the waitress is hot i bet we could get her to come home with us or how much does your mom weigh i want to know what i’m getting into
i didn’t say anything like that
they also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate sadly that’s my home run swing
look everything went fine i didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters the woman across the hall is into me
let’s go to the tape look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss no change in respiration pupils undilated no flushing of the chest
nice close up by the way
interesting her jaws are clenched no tongue access clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans
please you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement
and the worst sign of all is you’re here and not there
i’m not there because i’m taking things slow which by the way compared to you guys approaches warp speed and take down that camera
he was a lot more fun when he had no hope
oh hi penny fyi the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so i’d avoid using that for your delicates
oh good lord why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock
sheldon may i ask you a question
i would prefer that you not but i won’t go so far as to forbid it
alright i heard yes so… okay here’s my question has leonard ever dated you know a regular girl
well i assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity because i’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate
no i meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac
oh well a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a phd in french literature
how is that not a braniac
well for one thing she was french for another it was literature
so do you think that if leonard and i keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me
do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics
do you know any card tricks
okay okay you know i get it leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college
why would you lie about that
well he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and i didn’t want him to think i was some stupid loser
you thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate
you know there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates
right okay look this is between you and me you cannot tell leonard any of this
you’re asking me to keep a secret
well i’m sorry but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret so that i could choose whether or not i wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping you can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis
secret keeping is a complicated endeavour one has to be concerned not only about what one says but about facial expression autonomic reflexes when i try to deceive i myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility long pause it’s a joke it relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the bloodsucking arachnid and tic the involuntary muscular contraction i made it up myself
okay look if leonard finds out that i lied i will absolutely die of embarrassment
oh sheldon please look i’m asking you as a friend
so you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences
interesting see one more question and perhaps i should have led with this when did we become friends
ie i couldn’t become green lantern unless i was chosen by the guardians of oa but given enough startup capital and an adequate research facility i could be batman
sure in a gravelly voice i’m batman see
hey penny if you’re not doing anything friday night i thought maybe we could go and see a movie
oh um you know i think i have the dinner shift on friday
you know i’m not sure the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet how about i let you know
great so you just let me know when you know so… she leaves oh god i am the bad fish what did i do wrong
why are you asking me i have no information about your interactions with penny other than what you provided me nor do i have any method of learning such things runs away
nothing you seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and penny where obviously none exists
i just think you need to be careful how you phrase things sir
well i might ask you the same question why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me but exist between you and penny a person to whom i barely speak his eye begins to twitch
there’s no reason to bring my looks into this good day leonard
i said good day he leaves
also today we have a fresh caught alaska salmon and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice our soup of the day…
you must release me from my oath
why don’t you take a minute to decide leads her away i can’t keep your secret penny i’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space like a renaissance triptych like a cheap suit
oh look why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret
i’m constitutionally incapable that’s why i was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider located beneath a fake agricultural station 125 miles south east of travers city michigan which you did not hear about from me
look just forget i told you about me not graduating from community college okay
forget you want me to forget this mind does not forget i haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me it was a drizzly tuesday
okay look you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it
what do you mean you’re moving out why
there doesn’t have to be a reason
not necessarily this is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma either the reason is predicated on a series of subreasons leading to an infinite regression or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements or it’s ultimately circular ie i’m moving out because i’m moving out
leonard i don’t see how i could have made it any simpler
we just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers
and some of those skinless chicks were hot
if you’ll excuse me i’m going to pack
that’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia
it’s not you howard he says he’s moving out
what did you do did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television
did you take a band aid off in front of him
did you buy generic ketchup forget to rinse the sink talk to him through the bathroom door
adjust the thermostat cook with cilantro pronounce the t in often
did you make fun of trains
i didn’t do anything he’s just gone insane
well we all knew this day was coming
it’s my prepacked disaster evacuation bag recommended by the department of homeland security and sarah connor
until i find a permanent place i will stay with friends
well you can’t stay with me i have a teeny tiny apartment
excuse me but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of menushya yajna one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the hindu householder
don’t be ridiculous you love trains
yes i do come on see you later leonard sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word
this is a very old building
sixty years used to be a watch factory
don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials
i can’t believe i didn’t bring my gieger counter you know i had it on my bed and i didn’t pack it
well if you’re not comfortable staying here sheldon…
i’m kidding i packed it it was a joke i was subverting the conversational expectations i believe they call that the um old switcheroo
yes isn’t she an amazing actress
actually i’d say she’s a poor man’s madhuri dixit
how dare you aishwarya rai is a goddess by comparison madhuri dixit is a leprous prostitute
sorry i didn’t mean to offend you obviously you’re not that familiar with indian cinema
strippergram howard opens door outside are raj and sheldon
shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire
i’ve never slept on an air mattress before no lumbar support whatsoever
maybe you’d be happier on a park bench
i don’t see any way to get a park bench in here
no that’s fine i’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle
get out of bed we’re switching
now only if you want to
for god’s sake ma i’m 27 years old it’s not even a school night to sheldon comfy now
meh that poster of halle berry’s a little unnerving
she’s like my fourth favourite catwoman
yeah julie newmar michelle pfieffer eartha kitt and then her
oh i forgot about lee meriwether
that makes halle berry my fifth favourite catwoman there’s julie newmar michelle pfieffer eartha kitt lee meriwether…
please i’m begging you go to sleep
i’m trying i’m counting catwomen she did make a fine mutant in the xmen movies though
but she’s not my favourite of the xmen in order that would be wolverine cyclops oh wait i forgot professor x professor x wolverine cyclops iceman then storm angel the beast oh wait nightcrawler professor x nightcrawler wolverine cyclops iceman then storm angel…
i’m coming opens the door sheldon falls inside wearing his pyjamas howard is outside
hey there he is there’s my old buddybudbud
koothrappali dumped him on me and he couldn’t get to sleep so i gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it but he still wouldn’t shut up so tag you’re it
i still don’t know why you left
that i wouldn’t tell you the secret shhhhh
what secret tell me the secret
mom smokes in the car jesus is okay with it but we can’t tell dad
not that secret the other secret
dammit sheldon you said penny told you a secret what was the secret
okay i’ll tell you but you can’t tell leonard
penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for leonard
so it’s nothing i did it’s her problem
i drank milk that tasted funny
penny thinks i’m too smart for her that’s ridiculous
i know most of your work is extremely derivative don’t worry that’s not a secret everybody knows
yeah hi listen i know what’s been bothering you about us and i have the answer
first i want to say that it’s not sheldon’s fault he tried very hard to keep your secret if howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave
yes but it’s okay now that we know what the problem is there’s a simple solution hands her a brochure
a place for fun a place for knowledge see this man here’s playing hacky sack and this girl’s going to be a paralegal
wow i get it because dr leonard hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree
well it’s really not that fancy it’s just a city college
right but i have to have some sort of degree to date you
that doesn’t matter to me at all
so it’s fine with you if i’m not smart
absolutely she slams the door in his face okay this time i know where i went wrong looking up and seeing the camera oh bite me
it was rife with historical inaccuracies for example the tavern girl serving flagons of mead now her costume was obviously germanic but in 1487 the bavarian purity laws or rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead at best they would have had some sort of spiced wine
ohho really well here’s another nit for you the flagons would not have been made of polypropylene
renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy they’re about taking chubby girls who work at kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy
bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century if anything they would have said “huzzah”
i don’t care what the bosoms say sheldon i just want to be part of the conversation
hi guys looks like you’ve been to the renaissance fair i’m hoping
renaissance fair more of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair
okay fine whatever um you guys this is my friend eric
so yeah good to see you
yeah yeah it’s good to see you too we should really go
thanks my mom made it penny with a new guy tres awkward
it wasn’t awkward it wasn’t fun besides what’s the big deal we dated we stopped dating and now we’re both moving on
by moving on do you mean she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with wolowitz
that was not fifteenth century soap my god those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it
can we please just go in my chain mail is stuck in my underwear
relatively modern why what are you wearing
i fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen
you went out and bought linen
don’t be silly i borrowed one of your pillow cases
you know what i’m happy that penny’s moving on it gives me the freedom to move on myself
are you saying that you’ve been holding back
so how do you explain the ten years before penny
what i’ve dated plenty of women there was joyce kim leslie winkle
notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary the word plenty has been redefined to mean two
uh what about that girl last year at comiccon
what happens in costume at comiccon stays at comiccon
you’re only saying that because of what happened to you
it wasn’t your fault raj he was dressed as a green orion slave girl
hhhhow did we get on me we were mocking leonard for not moving on dude you have totally not moved on
yes i have it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone
well there’s joyce kim but she defected back to north korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable
her research methodology is sloppy she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me
you’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension mud
look i like leslie but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release
yeah so be a tool go get yourself a little rebound stress release
technically it would only be rebound if he and penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy
you mean like you and richard the slave girl
i bought him dinner and we kissed once that was it leaving and he told me his name was kimberley
you know how i know we’re not in the matrix
if we were the food would be better
hello to you insufficiently intelligent person
ooh rush me to the burn unit hey leonard do you have a second i need to ask you something
well if you’ll excuse me i’m going to go do work that promises significant results as opposed to what you do which does not yeah you heard me
wow so i heard your relationship with penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory
actually i read it wolowitz texted me shows him text
like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory yep
i thought it was a pretty good one i gave him an lol anyway it got me thinking now that you’re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment
are you suggesting another bout of stress release
no i’m all done with casual sex from now on i’m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm
it’s hard to say i guess there’s just a time in every woman’s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn’t know
yeah i can see how that would… a bunch of people
anyway i just figure it’s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you
oh i’m flattered so how do you suggest we proceed
your place we’ll order chinese you’ll rent a movie artsy but accessible then light petting no coitus
i’ll leave the details up to you i think it’s better if you assume the male role
great news my mom sent me my old nintendo 64
you know what this means don’t you break out the red bull it’s time to rock mario old school
i kind of have other plans tonight
but it’s friday friday’s always vintage game night look mom included the memory card we can pick up where i left off in 1999 when i had pernicious anaemia
well the thing is someone’s coming over
well then no problem i have three controllers the more the merrier
sheldon it’s a date i have a date coming over
oh well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion
why what’s so unusual about me having a date
alright alright well uh nevertheless i have one now and i would appreciate it if you would you know make yourself scarce
leonard i am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an iq which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests how much scarcer could i be
you know what i mean could you just give us a little privacy
you want me to leave the apartment
you mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else
well why should i leave this is my apartment too
i know it is and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy i would be more than happy to get out of your way
playing super mario on a poorly coded nintendo 64 emulator
yeah but why are you doing it on the stairs
i’m a modern day napoleon exiled to the elba of the staircase because leonard get this has a date
oh oh well good for him yeah but why are you sitting here why don’t you just go to a movie or something
what if i choke on my popcorn who will administer the heimlich manoeuvre
no popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself
well why don’t you go to a coffee shop
i don’t know you know cookies pastries…
leslie winkle of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world why does it have to be leslie winkle
well they have a lot in common i mean they’re both scientists
oh please the only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space
okay well i have a date too so see ya
everybody has a date even you mario going after princess peach and what am i doing i’m just enabling you
this is pretty good orange chicken
oh so how many children do you think we should have leonard splutters and coughs i’m sorry that was a little abrupt
i mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction
besides shortness what genetic weaknesses run in your family
i’m sorry to interrupt batteries dying continue
uh genetic weaknesses right um there’s the lactose intolerance
don’t forget the male pattern baldness when his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs exits extension cord trails after him eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose
okay now my uncles are bald but my aunt edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet so… sweet lady it always tickles when she hugs me sheldon knocks and enters again what now
listen i’m sorry about all of sheldon’s interruptions he can be a bit of an eccentric
if by eccentric you mean passiveaggressive east texas blowhole i agree
well i think tonight was a very good start
me too you’re sure you’re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test
no problem i’m very skilled at postponing intercourse so i guess i’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening
yes i believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so i’m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness
again it’s your decision you’re the man
no it wasn’t my cat it was an experiment designed by this guy named schrodinger
no he was some kind of scientist let me start again oh hey leonard
okay well goodnight leans in to kiss leslie
okay well goodnight grabs eric and kisses him more passionately
that ain’t going to make your point grabs him and tries to outpassion penny the two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until leonard grabs leslie’s ass okay that’s enough sweetly call me exits
right goes back inside flat closes door
had a great time ciao closes door
i’m sorry i am not going back to the renaissance fair
come on sheldon there’s so few places i can wear my jester costume
i don’t care there are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort
oh okay how about this you can go dressed as a star trek science officer exploring a planet similar to earth in the 1500s
hey why don’t we all move over there so leslie can join us
hmm let’s do it sheldon does not move leonard looks confused
if you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may i suggest one potato two potato or as i call it the leslie winkle experimental methodology
don’t make this hard for me
it’s not hard it’s simple you can either sit with me your friend colleague and roommate or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with
you’re right it is simple sits with leslie
third floor tonight mixing it up sheldon indicates extension cord oh you know i still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something
alright let’s say i go to dinner alone and during the meal i have to use the rest room how do i know someone’s not touching my food
penny hold on are you sure things can’t work out with you and leonard
i’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try or in your case the old community college try
okay where is this coming from
leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy
yes the doctor doom to my mr fantastic the doctor octopus to my spiderman the doctor sivana to my captain marvel
okay i get it i get it i get it
do you know it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out
sheldon come back you’re losing me
leslie winkle penny she belittles my research
given this situation i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with leonard
oh gee well thankyou for that but um i think for now leonard and i are just going to stay friends
no that response is unacceptable to me
sheldon you are a smart guy you must know…
smart i’d have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as smart
are you going to let me talk
you must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together nothing you can do is going to stop it
you continue to underestimate my abilities madam
okay let me put it this way if you’re really leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with
wait a minute why am i doing all the giving here if leonard’s really my friend why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of leslie winkle
oh now you’re just making stuff up
oh mario if only i could control everyone the way i control you hop you little plumber hop hop hop
when the two of you reach a natural stopping point i’d like to have a word
if the word is peepee just do it
leonard you are my friend and friends support their friends apparently so i am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie
i will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory you kids have fun
hang on a second loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory
okay well for one thing we expect quantii spacetime to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours
balderdash matter clearly consists of tiny strings
are you going to let him talk to me like that
okay well there is a lot of merit to both theories
no there isn’t only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes sheldon grunts
sheldon don’t make that noise it’s disrespectful
i hope so it was a snort of derision
you agree with me right loop quantum gravity is the future of physics
sorry leslie i guess i prefer my space stringy not loopy
well i’m glad i found out the truth about you before this went any further
truth what truth we’re talking about untested hypotheses uh it’s no big deal
oh it isn’t really tell me leonard how would we raise the children
i guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory
we can’t let them choose leonard they’re children storms off
i’m sorry i could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat icecream or ever get a good view of a parade but this this is a deal breaker leaves
only nine more months to comiccon
captain i’m getting an unusual reading
yeah that’s great you guys want corn dogs
that’s a temporal anomaly corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century
fellow warriors this is sheldor the conqueror we are about to enter axel’s fortress now this is a long run so let’s do another bladder check alright barry we’ll wait for you again but you really should see a doctor there is banging at the door sheldor is afk goes out to find penny having trouble getting into her apartment penny are you experiencing some sort of difficulty
yes i can’t get my stupid door open
you appear to have put your car key in the door lock are you aware of that
alright then turns to return inside one of the grocery bags penny is holding falls to the floor spilling groceries
dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit
would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly
i can’t get the damned key out
well that’s not surprising that baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders whereas the key for your volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system
you’re welcome point of inquiry why did you put your car key in the door lock
why i’ll tell you why because today i had an audition it took me two hours to get there i waited an hour for my turn and before i could even start they told me i looked too midwest for the part too midwest what the hell does that even mean
well the american midwest was mostly settled by scandinavian and germanic peoples who well they have a characteristic facial bone structure…
i know what it means sheldon god you know i have been in la for almost two years now and i haven’t got a single acting job i have accomplished nothing haven’t gotten a raise at work haven’t even had sex in six months and just now when i was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and i ate it
well actually insects are a dietary staple in many cultures they’re almost pure protein
i believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag but returning to your key conundrum perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you
i did and he said he’ll get here when he gets here
and you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology
no i am frustrated because i am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly bursts into tears
there there reluctantly would you prefer to wait in our apartment
no sheldon i’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three yearold
alright then turns to go inside again
for god’s sake stomps into apartment
just when i think i’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm
make yourself comfortable sits in sheldon’s place not there sits on other end of sofa puts feet on table sheldon looks disapprovingly removes feet from table sheldon sits and replaces headset sheldor is back online
afk i’m playing age of conan an online multiplayer game set in the universe of robert e howard’s conan the barbarian
yes but what does it stand for
now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on
oh i don’t know can i see them in another colour
just click on them congratulations you are now a level three warrior
leonard guess what i’m a level three warrior
great you know there are groceries outside of your apartment
i only bring it up because your icecream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife
uhhuh yeah do i stay in the jungle or go towards the beach
it doesn’t matter right now you’re looking for treasure
okay leonard motions for sheldon to talk in the kitchen wait wait where are you going
you’re okay if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots
well let’s see uh she attempted to open her apartment with her car key because her face is overly midwestern um she hasn’t had sex in six months and she ate a fly
oh my god a treasure chest i’m rich
level three and she thinks she’s rich what a noob
hey check it out it’s just corn starch and water
they make up a nonnewtonian fluid which is liquid but solid under the percussive action of the speaker
that’s what makes it get all funky
yeah okay listen i need to talk to sheldon
no that’s what she said sheldon
okay look i bought the game and i’ve been exploring the island of tordage but i can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain
do you have the enchanted sword
no no i’ve a bronze dagger
you can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger my lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again
alright alright how do i get the sword
well have you been to the temple of mithra
is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it
no no no it’s… oh for god’s sakes gimme takes laptop
thank you i really appreciate this
you’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself penny
don’t patronise me just get the sword
beats me they were playing all last night too
it’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover
like if hulk were dating peppermint patty
i always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian
no that’s marcie peppermint patty’s just athletic
there you go one enchanted sword
right gimme gimme gimme i want to kill the guard captain leaves
that girl needs to get a life
no danger look it’s just me penny look i got to level 25 and reached purple lotus swamp right
yeah leonard gave me an emergency key
people can’t be in my bedroom
okay well can we go talk in the living room
i can’t wear different pyjamas these are my monday pyjamas penny people cannot be in my bedroom
okay just tell me is it too soon to join a quest to the black castle
you were invited on a quest to the black castle
yeah yeah by some guys in budapest i’m just not sure it’s the right move for my character
of course it’s not you’re only a level 25 the hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder
really boy you’d think you could trust a horde of hungarian barbarians
please penny enough i have to sleep
okay well you were great thanks comes out door oh hey leonard listen don’t got in sheldon’s room he’s not wearing bottoms
sheldon you want to catch me up again
people i am very busy today
i realise that dr gablehauser but it is your job as head of the department to mediate all interdepartmental disputes university policy manual chapter four subsection two mediation of interdepartmental disputes
fine dr winkle what colourful name did you call dr cooper this time
here’s the problem i was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in buckman 204 and dr winkle just wantonly ripped the signup sheet off the wall
it wasn’t even an official signup sheet he printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months
if it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing subatomic wild geese then i plead guilty his phone rings oh penny
you need to get that dr cooper
well don’t turn it off you might miss your call from the nobel committee letting you know you’ve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year
oh yeah well you wouldn’t even be nominated dr gablehauser i have a series of important multibit calculations and simulations to run all she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…
excuse me gablehauser holding phone out to sheldon it’s for you
hello penny this is not a good time no i told you you’re not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls you need to be in a group of at least five for that quest and one should be a level 35 healer penny i can’t log on and help you we’ll talk when i get home puts phone down i’m not getting the computing time am i
leonard you have to do something about penny she is interfering with my sleep she’s interfering with my work and if i had another significant aspect of my life i’m sure she’d be interfering with that too
why should i do something you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming
well yes but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in if you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening
why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone
i did i told her i texted her i sent out a very emphatic twitter i even changed my facebook status to sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone i don’t know what else to do
well what am i supposed to do
i don’t know but if you don’t figure something out i warn you i shall become very difficult to live with
you mean up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime sheldon
no fritz i need you on my flank no i don’t know german flankenzie flankenzie
yeah i see that shouldn’t you be at work
okay um here’s the thing um sometimes people good people you know they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own you know kind of addicted
yeah get to the point i’m about to level up here
well iiiit’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment
yeah jabber jabber jabber okay boys queen penelope’s back online
penny you’ve got cheetos in your hair
hey penny it’s me again leonard
i said not now chops off his head
penny’s been keeping him up at night
me too but probably in a different way
she’s gotten really hooked on age of conan she’s playing nonstop
ah yes online gaming addiction there’s nothing worse than having that multiplayer monkey on your back
oh yeah well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males… oh i’m too tired to do this
right i heard you’ve been pulling all nighters with middleearth barbie
she comes into my room noone’s supposed to be in my room
well i would postulate that she’s escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration
i do that too but probably in a different way
that’s not what she’s doing leslie she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem it has nothing to do with sex
everything has to do with sex
mmmm testify puts up hand for a handslap
leslie you are way off base here
hang on leonard while i have no respect for leslie as a scientist or a human being for that matter we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness
thank you my point is that tinkerbell just needs to get her some
some what oh yes some sexual intercourse
excuse me this whole idea is insane
yeah yeah enough debate i’m going to take action leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table excuse me are you currently involved in a sexual relationship
zip it pip it can i have your phone number
uh… checks out sheldon’s package yeah yeah pulls out pen and writes it on sheldon’s hand
okay i’m at the gate to the treasury of the ancients i’m going in
stay close to the wall avoid the mummies
i must say you’re playing very well for a woman of 23
right 22 cut to his screen he is filling in an online dating profile
oh here come the mummies which spell do i use the hateful strike or the frenzy stance
what happened to the rest of your group
i dumped them they’re a bunch of wussies
so listen would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands or staying at home curled up with a good book
these are market research questions i’m filling out the online registration for your game
oh okay wild adventure oh frenzy stance isn’t working die you undead mummy die
you’re welcome anyhow on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being always initiated by him and 5 being always initiated by you how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin
oh yes it’s quite extensive but if we complete it we get a free expansion pack 75 additional quests
ooh awesome okay i totally like to initiate i’m a big old five
good to know big old five
hi tom sheldon didn’t i explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria
yes you were very clear as was everyone else at the table tom however has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for penny
well what passes for science on dating sites they claim to use heuristic algorithms but it may well be hokum
you got penny to sign up for online dating
no of course not no i used trickery and deceit
tom is a paramedic with the fire department but he’s going to med school at night uh he likes the outdoors and uh strong women who initiate sex
i’m surprised you struck out with penny apparently she’s a big old five
oh good you got my note penny i’d like you to meet tom uh penny this is tom tom may i present penny
yeah hi listen as long as i’m here i’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs they don’t know what they’re doing we’ve got one assassin three spellcasters and no tank
can we talk about this later
no no no no i need you now
but wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with tom who is a sexually passive outdoorsman
whatever i’ll figure it out myself
it is i sir howard of wolowitz can i interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern
oh my god i need help closes laptop and throws it away
let’s see raj was the kung palo chicken
who was the shrimp with lobster sauce
that would be me come to poppa you unkosher delight to penny i’m not necessarily talking to the food
i had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers
i thought the blowers were more sanitary
hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry
hey guys i just got the most amazing new… spots penny ewewew
gosh raj do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk shakes head okay well i’ll just um go eat by myself
penny you don’t have to do that
no it’s okay between indicates raj him not talking indicates sheldon him talking and… indicates howard him i’m better off alone so to raj goodbye you poor strange little man gives him a kiss and exits
remember that little planetary object i spotted beyond the kuiper belt
oh yeah two zero zero eight nq sub seventeen
or as i called it planet bollywood anyway because of my discovery people magazine is naming me one of their thirty under30 to watch
excuse me thirty what under thirty what to watch what
thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields
if i had a million guesses i never would have gotten that
it’s pretty cool they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in indonesia and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners and ellen page star of the charming independent film juno
do i get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used
sorry it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative in which a humble boy from new delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to america to reach for the stars
poverty your father’s a gynaecologist he drives a bentley
i’m confused was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included
peer review it’s people magazine people picked me
yeah but exactly who are these people what are their credentials how are they qualified what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty
boy i bet ellen pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap
oh there’s my missing neutrino you were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge weren’t you you little subatomic dickens
here look look i found my missing neutrino
oh good we can take it off the milk cartons
well we’re going to go apologise to raj and invite him out to dinner
well he came over last night with some pretty good news and we weren’t very supportive
i sense you’re trying to tell me something
oh no i beg to differ of the three of us i was by far the most supportive
how will raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him when i was eleven my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug and frankly the man coasted until the day he died
okay let’s try it this way what if the people magazine thing is the best raj is ever going to achieve
i often forget other people have limitations it’s so sad
not really it’s what you and i would call condescension
and when we go in there let’s show raj that we’re happy for him
well then fake it look at me i could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz but i’m bigger than that
fine what do you want me to do
we’re here to see koothrappali not kill batman
try less teeth does it isn’t much better
close enough come on knocking and entering hi raj
we just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight
celebrate your thirty under thirty thing right sheldon he smiles
it’s very nice of you i would like that
mister wolowitz boys i’ve got a question for you who in this room discovered a star
actually 2008 nq sub 17 is a planetary body
i’m not talking about you i’m talking about me you my exotic young friend are my star
well you didn’t discover him you merely noticed he was here much like he did with 2008 nq sub 17
well we’ve got to get you into a better office something more suited to your status
really you don’t have to go to any trouble
how about if i put you in von gerlick’s old office
i’d rather have fishbine’s it’s bigger
wait a minute i called dibs on fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe
he gets a new office i can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room
let me ask you something what do you think the business of this place is
and this boy’s picture in people magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than… well taller than you ruffling howard’s hair
who doesn’t dr koothrappali have you ever had lunch in the president’s dining room
i didn’t even know there was a president’s dining room
it’s the same food as the cafeteria only fresh come on little buddy
okay big buddy see you tonight guys they leave
so anyway after a fantastic lunch i was whisked off to the people magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot
it’s fantastic apparently the camera loves me and i it they shot me in front of a starry background where i posed like this stares into space they’re going to digitally add a supernova they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent
right a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself leonard nudges him he smiles phone rings
excuse me oh it’s my assistant trevor go for koothrappali uhhuh
they gave him an assistant if i want a new pen i have to go to the bank with wire cutters
have we at this point met our social obligations
okay just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why i can’t go alrighty koothrappali out god bless that boy i don’t know what i’d do without him
you just got him this afternoon
yes but i’m finding that having a lackey suits me
oh i’m sorry is that politically incorrect in india we just call them untouchables
speaking of untouchables i’ve got great news for you guys people magazine is having a reception this saturday and i managed to get you invited
oh you’re welcome of course i couldn’t get you into the vip section because you know that’s for vips and you guys are just you know ps
there’s a tribe in papua new guinea where when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin superstitious nonsense of course but one can see their point smiles
here you go raj you might want to drink this one slowly
okay so saturday night can i count on my posse
gee i’d love to raj but i can’t make it
well uh no i… the… no
i can make it but i won’t
what are you guys talking about
well there’s a reception for my magazine article on saturday
and you guys aren’t going i can’t believe you raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him
a tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind
that would be cool i’d go to that reception
come on this is huge raj is going to be in people magazine and he didn’t even have to knock up one of the spears sisters
would you like to go with me
of course i would i would be honoured
look at that i got a date with penny i can’t believe it took you a whole year
now they all get up and leave raj looks around himself then leans over to the next table
hey buddy i’m going to be in people magazine
i know i am resplendent like the noonday sun am i not
um yeah starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you
it was in the limo they sent a limo i have a limo i just love saying limo here sip on this while you’re getting ready
um yeah why what’s wrong with it
nothing i was just hoping for something a little more you know redonkulous
yeah well this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get
okey dokey let’s roll alright it’s time to raise the roof ooooh ooooh
uh come on good night leonard
hey leonard did you see my limo downstairs
it’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in
i’m coming up so you better get this party started
hey good news you don’t have to sulk about penny any more look there are hundreds of croatian women just waiting for you to contact them
i’ll lend you my user name it’s wealthybigpenis
well you gotta make it easy for them they’re just learning english
so you’re just going to sit around here and mope while penny is out with doctor apu from the kwikemart
it’s not a date and that’s racist
it can’t be racist he’s a beloved character on the simpsons
let’s just eat so i can get to bed with any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me
did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded
even though the menu description specifies shredded
did you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard
did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market
fine opens carton shows it to leonard in disgust
alright it’s shredded what do you want me to do
i want you to check before you accept the order
were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali might have intercourse with penny tonight
he’s not going to have intercourse with penny
then there’s no excuse for this chicken you know this situation with koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood
oh goody more tales from the panhandle
that’s northwest texas i’m from east texas the gulf region home to many vietnamese shrimpers
do the shrimpers feature in your story
no anyway when i was eight a montgomeryward delivery van ran over our cat lucky
he’s irony impaired just move on
okay dead cat named lucky continue
while others mourned lucky i realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs a faithful companion that i could snuggle with at night and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command
please no nothing so pedestrian i wanted a griffin
irrelevant see i was studying recombinant dna technology and i was confident i could create one but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them
sheldon not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story what’s your point
my point is if koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow undeserved fame perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort
you want to breed a new friend
that’s one option but who has the time but consider this the japanese they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence now you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at disney next thing you know we’re playing halo with a multilingual abraham lincoln
sheldon don’t take this the wrong way but you’re insane
that may well be but the fact is it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people
uh for the record it could kill us to meet new people they could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens and i’m not insane my mother had me tested
if we do get a new friend he should be a guy you can trust a guy who has your back
and he should have a lot of money and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties
he should share our love of technology
and he should know a lot of women
yeah let’s see money women technology okay we’re agreed our new friend is going to be iron man
yes it’s very nice goodnight raj
no wait the evening’s not over
no it’s time to put on some r kelly and suck face
oh wow is the evening over
wait wait that’s my mummy and daddy calling from india i want you to meet my parents
hello mummy and daddy good to see you i’m not drunk
just making conversation mummy daddy i want you to meet my new squeeze penny
i am not your squeeze there is no squeezing
i can’t see her centre her in the frame
so she’s not indian the boy’s just sowing some wild oats
no no there’s no sowing no squeezing and no sucking face
what if he gets her pregnant is this little hotsytotsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren
what right do you have to pick who i can have children with
look rajesh i understand you’re in america you want to try the local cuisine but trust me you don’t want it for a steady diet
now you listen to me i am no longer a child and i will not be spoken to like one now if you’d excuse me i have to go throw up
i don’t know maybe it’s the local cuisine okay well it’s nice to meet you just gonna set you on down over here and i’m going to leave so namaste leaves then almost immediately returns and fyi you’d be lucky to have me as a daughterinlaw
raj what are you doing he hands her the note no no notes if you have something to say to me say it
oh sweetie it’s okay she hugs him as she does leonard exits his apartment to see penny in bathrobe hugging raj who is apparently about to leave as she goes back inside raj turns smiles and puts both thumbs up leonard turns with an upset look to sheldon who is standing behind him sheldon gives him his exaggerated smile
yeah we’re going to have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work i bought these star wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep i don’t like the way darth vader stares at me
oh just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years that’s no reason to give up
sheldon i was up all night using the new freeelectron laser for my xray diffraction experiment
did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas
then you can drive let’s go
didn’t i tell you i’d be working nights and that you’d have to make other arrangements
but how am i going to get to work
i can’t take the bus any more they don’t have seatbelts and they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords
you tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords
i didn’t try i succeeded for some reason it alarmed the other passengers and i was asked to debus
oh you’re a big boy you’ll figure it out
don’t talk to me like i’m a child now take me to return my star wars sheets
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny…
thanks for the update begins to close door
no wait you have to drive me to work
yeah uh i really don’t think i do
but i don’t drive and i can’t take the bus
yeah honey you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing okay
penny didn’t you recently state that you and i are friends
then i hereby invoke what i’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship the favour
i’m sorry i didn’t realize i was interrupting your morning prayers when you’re done we’ll go
thank you for driving me to work
you know this is my day off sheldon
oh good i’m not keeping you from anything your check engine light is on
typically that’s an indicator to you know check your engine
it’s fine it’s been on for like a month
well actually that would be all the more reason to you know check your engine
if it were fine the light wouldn’t be on that’s why the manufacturer installed that light to let you know it’s not fine
is there a “check the check engine light light” penny takes a drink of coffee ooooh
studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol
euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies but it has speed bumps which appreciably increase pointtopoint drive time making it the less efficient choice but you have the conn of course if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps i withdraw my previous objection here’s a fun question do you know what the most common street name is
the answer’s tricky it’s second street you see you’d think it would be first street but in most towns first street eventually gets renamed to something else you know like main street broad street michigan avenue leonard and i often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brainteasers like that we also play games would you like to play one
oh come on it’s fun ooh another bump okay i’ll say an element and uh you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one i said okay i’ll start helium now you could say mercury that would give me a y ooh  very clever that’s a tough one so i go ytterbium which gets you back to m so you go molybdenum and i say magnesium you say manganese and  i say europium and and you’re left with mendelevium and  there are no more m’s because i believe that meitnerium should still be called ekairidium so congratulations you win do you wanna go again
how about we just have a little quiet time now
all right hmm huh i’m sorry i’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the checkengine light to be very troubling
well i have to tell you that while i do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine i’m not sure i’m capable of performing diagnostics
okay i’ll give it a shot gets out penny drives away
oh leonard there you are i’m ready to go home
sheldon i told you i only have access to the freeelectron laser at night i can’t drive you for the next few weeks
no you said you couldn’t drive me to work this is from work
no just for the fun of it i’m gonna take his side
now how do you propose i get home
how did you get here in the first place
penny but i sense that’s no longer an option
look i need to get to the laser lab you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home
oh damn i picked the wrong side
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa oh god not euclid avenue aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
why did howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway
we had a difference of opinion
whether or not he was trying to kill me for the record i maintain he was where are you going
oh but i’m not going home it’s wednesday wednesday is new comic book day we have to go to the comic book store and then we have to stop at soup plantation it’s creamy tomato soup day and radio shack there’s a sale on triplea batteries plus we have to go to pottery barn and return my star wars sheets
you want to go to pottery barn first
can you drive me to pottery barn she closes the door maybe if i turn off the nightlight i can keep the sheets
she’s in my spot don’t look at me like that everybody knows that my spot
sheldon you know  that we care about you
and it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up
you’re hurting the people around you sweetie
so we made you an appointment and we want you to keep it
department of motor vehicles new driver handbook but i don’t have a problem
sheldon you need to learn how to drive
penny’s taking you to the dmv i’m going to bed
hold on i have one condition
we have to stop at pottery barn
ooh i want to go to the comic book store he leaves
i just don’t see why i need a driver’s license albert einstein never had a driver’s license
yeah but albert einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour
yeah and i never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts you know i gotta ask why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else
examining perturbative amplitudes in n4 supersymmetric theories leading to a reexamination of the ultraviolet properties of multiloop n8 supergravity using modern twistor theory
well how ’bout when you were 17
take this to the testing area put your name at the top sign the bottom answer the questions bring it back next sheldon moves forward application
i’m actually more of a theorist
the application in your hand give it to her
take this to the testing area put your name at the top sign the bottom answer the questions bring it back next
excuse me but i have some concerns about these questions
look at that sign up there
does it say i give a damn
just look see this first question makes no sense how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving there’s no possible way to answer that a car length is not a standardized unit of measure
sheldon it’s c just put down c
i don’t need your help penny
listen to that little girl honey put c next
no no wait no hang on look at this next question
sheldon why are you arguing with the dmv
how else are they going to learn look question 2 when are roadways most slippery now okay there are three answers none of which are correct the correct answer is when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction
here’s your learner’s permit go away
but i’m not done i have many additional concerns about these questions
don’t make me climb over this counter
okay that’s it let’s boot it up
this is a stateoftheart simulator i adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army
is that why i appear to be in downtown fallujah behind the wheel of an uparmored humvee
i haven’t configured it yet let’s see… bradley tank… transport truck…  batmobile…
here we go red 2006 ford taurus on the streets of pasadena
statistically red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour i don’t want any hassles with the fuzz
fine what colour do you want
you know the pale blue of luke skywalker’s lightsaber before it was digitally remastered
okay now what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive
i haven’t fastened my seat belt yet
click now are there air bags
what if a simulated van rearends me
i’ll hit you in the face with a pillow
okay now shift into drive pull out slowly into traffic
watch watch out watch out for pedestrians
oh god wait slow hit the brakes hit the brakes
sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
how did you manage to get on the second floor of the glendale galleria
i don’t know i was on the pasadena freeway i missed my exit flew off the overpass and one thing led to another
maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow
no i quit stands up there is more sound of crashing and panic then animal noises
remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software it’s amazingly detailed
so waityou’re just gonna give up
no i’m not giving up i never give up
so what is it you’re doing
i’m transcending the situation i’m clearly too evolved for driving
leonard have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size
i wonder a lot of things about you sheldon but not… not that
well those are indicators that i’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human
well no no i’m not going to go so far as to say that i represent a distinct new stage in humankind you know a homo novus if you will no that’s for anthropologists to decide but i am convinced that the reason i cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because i’m not meant to
yes you are you’re meant to learn how to drive please learn how to drive
no no leonard i’m meant for greater things like unraveling the mysteries of the universe not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road
yeah well i know that now
fine assuming that everything you say is true how does the biologically superior homo novus get to work tomorrow morning
well hang in there maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings
good morning is there some new kind of casual friday i don’t know about
well since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until i’m finished with my experiment
but you finished your experiment a week ago
you saw nothing sweeps hood around himself and vanishes through cafeteria door
so if any of you are considering going into experimental physics my door is always open once again i’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach snapple into a helium neon laser short answer is… don’t and now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is dr sheldon cooper dr cooper
excuse me sheldon we both agreed to do this
it’s a waste of time i might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles
if you don’t do this i won’t take you to the comic book store
hello nice work with the laser by the way looking out at your fresh young faces i remember when i too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student of course i was 14 and i’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to despite my 9 o’clock bedtime now there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics although it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava
in short anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you a cruel trick indeed any questions of course not i weep for the future of science now if you’ll excuse me the latest issue of batman is out come leonard
laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now huh
i love this time of the year the leaves are turning there’s a bracing chill in the air
plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable that’s right honey have another calzone daddy can wait
isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students
no if you can talk to them you can ask them out
so dumbass i heard you made a grad student throw up last night
the truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it but why should i cater to secondrate minds
because firstrate minds call you “dumbass”
oh yeah well… you’re a mean person
excuse me dr cooper i’m ramona nowitzki i was at your talk last night i think you’re just brilliant
oh now i’m gonna throw up
howard wolowitz department of engineering codesigner of the international space station’s liquid waste disposal system
ew dr cooper i’ve read everything you’ve published i especially liked your paper on grand unification using stringnetwork condensates and was wondering how you determined that threedimensional stringnets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons
the fact is i’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a stringnet condensate
oh my god that would change the way we view the entire physical universe
you know the pishkinwolowitz liquid waste disposal system is turning a few heads as well
again ew you know i’d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos could we get a cup of coffee sometime
i do i love me a cup of joe
well it doesn’t have to be coffee how about dinner
great i know a terrific little italian place
i never eat in strange restaurants one runs the risk of nonstandard cutlery
sheldon lives in fear of the threetined fork
three tines is not a fork three tines is a trident forks are for eating tridents are for ruling the seven seas
what if i brought food to your place
that would be acceptable on mondays i eat thai food mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from siam palace
you got it i already have your address
sheldon do you have any idea what just happened
yes apparently i’m getting a free dinner
oh yeah no this thing’s majorly out of order picking up out of order sign see sorry
that’s okay guess i’m taking the stairs
oh are you here to see leonard
sheldon cooper tall thin looks a little like a giant praying mantis
thanks where should i put this
uh the kitchen’s fine to penny hey what are you doing
uhhuh the viewing area’s right over there sheldon your girl… date… person… ramona’s here
oh sorry i’m late i just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper
did you enjoy the humorous footnote where i illustrate mirrorsymmetry by likening it to the flash playing tennis with himself
so funny but the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity i have to tell you i found it physically exhilarating
my hypotheses tend to have that effect
i’m sorry i didn’t bring enough for your friends i assumed we were going to be alone
oh yeah no we were just going
no come on now we’re going out
oh come on we’ll be quiet
let’s go okay you two just have a nice… whatever this is
okay you guys look i know this is none of my business but i just i have to ask what’s sheldon’s deal
you know like what’s his deal is it girls guys sock puppets
honestly we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal
come on everybody has a deal
not sheldon over the years we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce i’m an advocate of mytosis
i believe one day sheldon will eat an enormous amount of thai food and split into two sheldons
on the other hand i think sheldon might be the larval form of his species and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton
okay well thanks for the nightmares
hey do you want to hang out with us
what are you guys gonna do
my mom’s making a brisket tonight
the one with the little onions mmm
are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again
so how’d it go with ramona last night
oh great she’s smart insightful and she has a very unique way of you know revering me
here’s your spinach mushroom omelette 
thank you did anyone touch it
gloves were worn by everyone involved i was vigilant
ramona pointed out that i’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines
time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day
you don’t tackle the big issues ramona you fence with them en garde riposte
so sheldon i see you’re organizing your papers for the smithsonian museum of dumbassery
there won’t be any room until they get rid of the permanent leslie winkle exhibit
i see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you i’ll let you keep your lunch money today
okay dr cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough if you’re going to stay you’ll have to be respectful and quiet leslie leaves ramona looks pointedly at leonard

yes i’m close to a breakthrough ooh it tickles
sorry puts package down and leaves in hallway shudders  holy crap on a cracker

and who was that great man

okay well once again you guys have a good… whatever this is
dr cooper i have to tell you your friends are holding you back
i prefer to think of it as i’m pulling them forward
halo night a man with your intellectual gifts doesn’t waste an evening playing video games
not if he wants a nobel prize
he does want that does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends
now shall we get back to work
i suppose battlestar galactica comes on tonight pause i guess i can wait for the dvd pause and then never ever watch it
penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
sheldon honey i’ve told you it’s a small apartment you only have to knock one time
please please i don’t have a lot of time look ramona finally dozed off and i need you to help me get rid of her
i don’t know but apparently i’m in some kind of relationship and you seem to be an expert at ending them
i see man after man leaving this apartment never to return
okay first of all it is not man after man
um… she distracted me i told you penny i don’t have time for your nonsense i have important things to do
i know what’s going on here
really well then will you explain it to me
you’re in love with dr cooper
uh yeah no that’s not it
don’t try to deny it he’s a remarkable man but you have to let him go
i know it’s hard but he’s a gift to the whole world and we can’t be selfish
yeah he’s a gift all right
um sure sisters ramona leaves holy crap on a cracker
sheldon pause then more tapping what are you doing

sheldon i’m not going to learn morse code at three o’clock in the morning
don’t come in here don’t come in here don’t come in here don’t sheldon enters aw what’s going on
shh ramona’s sleeping on the couch
i know when is she going home
never that’s the problem i need your help
i’m invoking the skynet clause of our friendship agreement
that only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the earth
shh all right i’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause
the bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod
yes she’s in the living room go i’ll wait here
sheldon what are you doing out of bed
you know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels now come on
i’ve got it i finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of stringnetwork condensates
and i could not have done it without you
oh please i just offered a little encouragement
it was a lot more than that you helped me work out the masses of all the fermions and you pumiced my hammer toe how can i ever repay you
well would you consider naming it the coopernowitzki theorem
oh you want me to share credit
excuse me dr cooper i’m kathy o’brien i just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of stringnetwork condensates and it just took my breath away
maybe when i publish it i’ll include an inhaler
let’s see today’s thursday thursday nights i eat pizza from giacomo’s sausage mushrooms light olives
sheldon do you see what just happened here
yes i’m getting a free pizza i’m on a roll
sheldon you’ve already had four servings
you might want to slow down a bit buddy
that’s it no more thai food
that isn’t klingon it’s yiddish for meatfilled dumpling
well as it turns out it’s also a klingon word
hey guys i need to use your tv
i don’t know it just died i’m getting a bunch of static
did you pay your cable bill
you sound just like the cable company all right so shh tyra banks is about to kick someone off  america’s next top model
what do you mean aw like she didn’t know we were nerds
all right if you must watch then mute it with closed captions please
oh worf nice too bad that’s a proper noun
oh look the’s the future mrs wolowitz no wait that’s the future mrs wolowitz with her head in the lap of what a coincidence it’s the future mrs wolowitz
yeah and they can all move in with you and your mother the current mrs wolowitz
is qochbe’ spelled with a gargling or a guttural grunt
why is that mrs wolowitz crying
oh that’s anais none of the other girls in the house like her
they all live in a house together
i don’t know somewhere in la
wait a minute you’re telling me that i’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels
and they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights
all right pencils down i have lokh makh and cherrrkh anybody got those
did i miss anything did they kick giselle off
not yet but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment
sadly mrs giselle wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine lucky for her i like my fashion models pruny and bugeyed
there’s the house freeze frame freeze frame
marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels
isn’t it obvious every week they kick out a beautiful girl making her feel unwanted and without selfesteem aka the future mrs howard wolowitz
well then what took you so long
hey guys what’d i miss what’d i miss
then you’re not invited to our wedding
oh do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudoreality again
you and i have a standing tv schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise any alterations except for breaking news have to be preapproved at the weekly roommate meeting
but you have to make a motion to put it on agenda
oh i’ll make a motion but you’re not going to like it
fine mock parliamentary procedure at least put it on mute
oh giselle’s not getting kicked off it’s totally going to be summer she picks up one of sheldon’s onion rings raj lets out a high pitched squeak and points what
sheldon’s onion ring just put it back
just put it back before he comes
no no no  no i don’t think that’s where it was
okay here he comes deny deny people wall of silence
i don’t know i was hungry what’s the big deal
the big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate
all right look i didn’t know i’m sorry
well i’m sorry but that is your second strike
you have two strikes three strikes and you’re out it’s a sports metaphor
all right yeah i’ll play along what was my first strike
march 18th you violated my rule about forwarding email humour
the photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”
oh come on everybody loves lolcats they’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats
i trusted you with my email address and you betrayed that trust by sending me internet banality strike one touching my food strike two
don’t worry they only stay on your record for a year
you can get them removed early but you have to take his class
come on i touched one onion ring
and then you put it back compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings
oh honey the buses don’t go where you live do they
look penny i wish i could be more lenient with you but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group i have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else
congratulations you’re officially one of us
one of us one of us
oh jeez you’ve got to be kidding me
yeah yeah uh see here’s the thing after you leave i still have to live with him
i don’t care i’m taking a stand metaphorically
all right that’s it strike three
i’m banished what the hell kind of crap is that
listen don’t worry i’ll talk to him
just so i know would you be open to taking his class you can do it online
so based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the hollywood hills
when we find it you want to go with us
party with the pretty girls dude
are you insane you’re not going to party with them you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place
that’s what they said to neil armstrong about the moon
no one said anything of the kind to neil armstrong the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon
well my fellow americans before this year is out we will put a wolowitz on one of america’s top models
and a large number of people will believe it never happened
okay let me guess a quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactoseintolerant leonard
shrimp caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosheronlyonthehighholidays howard and for our suddenly back on the hindu wagon raj meatlover’s pizza no meat coming right up
wait excuse me you forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger barbecue sauce bacon and cheese on the side
oh i didn’t tell you you’re banished from the cheesecake factory
well you have three strikes one coming in two sitting down and three i don’t like your attitude
you can’t do that not only is it a violation of california state law it flies directly in the face of cheesecake factory policy
yeah no there’s a new policy no shoes no shirt no sheldon
i bet we could sell that sign all over pasadena
penny can i talk to you for a minute hi
look here’s the thing um i talked to sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line
yeah so just apologize to him okay
what i’m not going to apologize to that nutcase
oh come on it’s easy he’ll even tell you what to say
leonard don’t you get it if you guys keep going along with his insanity you’re just encouraging him
we’re not encouraging it’s more like knuckling under
look i like hanging out with you guys but i’m not going to apologize for something i didn’t do
well actually technically you did do it
there you go quesadilla salad there’s your pizza and thanks to sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger barbecue sauce bacon and cheese on the side
go ahead eat it i dare you
that’s it there’s the house i found america’s top models
look on the roof anais and giselle are sunbathing europeanstyle
you can recognize people on google earth
of course not i got a buddy of mine at norad to have a spy drone fly over
it was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in siberia i took it an hour out of its way tops
sheldon i just dropped him off at the comic book store why
greetings hamburger toucher you are probably wondering why you cannot im with your little friends about how much you heart various things well this recorded message is alerting you that i am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our wifi if you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company set up your own wifi and pay for it or you may apologize to me
no no no no no it is on i am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt
oh penny you don’t want to get into it with sheldon the guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain
i don’t care i was in junior rodeo i can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds
no need to neuter the nerd i can get you back online
hello puny insects as a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will everyone is awarded one additional strike
what are you complaining about i’m the one who has to take the class again
time to do your laundry huh
it’s saturday night saturday is laundry night
i know every saturday at 8
i’m implying that you’re a creature of habit and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on saturday at 8
oh no are all the machines taken what are you gonna do
no problem i’ll just do my laundry another night
another night well i guess you can try but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always saturday night
woman you are playing with forces beyond your ken
yeah well your ken can kiss my barbie
sheldon knock knock knock sheldon knock knock knock sheldon
yes i left them in the washers and when i went down to get them they were gone
really despite the sign that says “do not leave laundry unattended”
you know i do recall seeing some female undergarments where was that oh yes earlier this evening i happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye do those look familiar
how the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire
when you understand the laws of physics penny anything is possible and may i add mwahhaha
well then may i suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata
look wait sheldon this has gotten out of hand okay i’ve done some stupid things you’ve done some stupid things how about we just call it even and move on with our lives
look you’ve got to meet me halfway here
i am meeting you halfway i’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things
hey you guys are talking again good what happened
leonard remember when i said it was on well now it’s junior rodeo on
oh not junior rodeo what did you do
i had no choice leonard she ruined laundry night
telephone wires can’t electrocute you can they
no look this has to stop
oh no no no it is just beginning
all right i really didn’t want to do this but… here
he can never know that i gave that to you
look i said i wanted to hurt him but but this
it’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives
oh pause it that’s it confirmed we now have the address of the top model house
god bless you google street view registered trademark
okay for the record what you’re doing is really creepy
you know what if it’s creepy to use the internet military satellites and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that i can drop in on them unexpectedly then fine i’m creepy
hello oh hi yeah hold on a second i’ll get him sheldon it’s for you
oh good hi mom how are you but mom she keeps sitting in my spot and and she touched my food okay yes i took her clothes but she started it no that’s not fair why should i have to apologize yeah i really don’t think this is the kind of thing jesus concerns himself with no you’re right i don’t really know what jesus thinks about all right goodbye did you tell on me
are you kidding me i already have two strikes
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny… door opens i am very very sorry for what i have done here’s your laundry i rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished
can i sit wherever i want no no never mind never mind that’s that’s not important sheldon this was big of you thank you i really appreciate it
yes we here to fix the cable
she’s taller than all the women in my family combined
oh look saturn 3 is on
i don’t want to watch saturn 3 deep space nine is better
how is deep space nine better than saturn 3
simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better
in what sense is that a compromise
well five is partway between three… never mind
i’ll tell you what how about we go rockpaperscissors
ooh i don’t think so no anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rockpaperscissors players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80 of the time due to the limited number of outcomes i suggest rockpaperscissors lizardspock
it’s very simple look scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock crushes lizard lizard poisons spock spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard lizard eats paper paper disproves spock spock vaporizes rock and as it always has rock crushes scissors
okay i think i got it they prepare
rockpaperscissors lizardspock both hold up the symbol for spock oh
noticed the eye patch did you it’s all part of a technique i’ve been studying for picking up women you employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable
oh yes like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters
or in this case the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye
mock me if you will but it works you show up at a club in something distinctive scope out your target and toss out some negs
a neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game like “normally i’m not turned on by big teeth but on you they work” i’ve got a whole list of ’em who wants to be my wingman
you’re not gonna need wingman you’re gonna need a paramedic
howard your scooter’s blocking my car aw did you get pinkeye again
step one she notices the eye patch may i say penny not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair she reaches out pulls his eye patch away from his face then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place
yeah just move your stupid scooter before i pick it up and throw it in the dumpster
i’m sorry but i’m not going to watch the clone wars tv series until i’ve seen the clone wars movie i prefer to let george lucas disappoint me in the order he intended
well i want to watch it now
then i believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rockpaperscissors lizardspock moment
i saw what you did there
hello hey howard what’s wrong okay okay we’ll be right there
howard’s at the mars rover lab he says he’s in trouble defcon 5
defcon 5 well there’s no need to rush
defcon 5 means no danger defcon 1 is a crisis
how can 5 not be worse than 1
yeah star trek v worse than i
okay first of all that’s a comparison of quality not intensity secondly star trek i is ordersofmagnitude worse than star trek v
are you joking star trek v is the standard against which all badness is measured
no no no star trek v has specific failures in writing and direction while star trek i fails across the board art direction costuming music sound editing
can we just forget i said defcon and go
all right will you at least stipulate that star trek iv
i have three words for you wrath of khan
i got the mars rover stuck in a ditch
on a dusty highway just outside bakersfield where do you think on mars
yeah baby i’ll be right in
you brought a girl to the mars rover control room
yeah i picked her up in the bar she’s a doctor one free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not jewish
wait a minute so the eye patch and the insults worked
no there were three other guys with eye patches iit was a fiasco what did work was “how’d you like to visit a secret government facility”
so what exactly do you want us to do
i need you and raj to help me get the rover out of the ditch and i need you to get stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here she doesn’t exactly have clearance
really they don’t let strange women from honkytonks come in and play with 200million government projects on distant planets
yes i was bad maybe she’ll spank me can we please move on
hey howard you know it’s getting late so do i get to drive this thing or what
yeah no i’m sorry but something’s come up kind of a mars rover mars rover can howard come over situation so my friend leonard is gonna take you home
oh okay let’s go friend leonard
yeah so are you a scientist like howard
no one’s a scientist like howard
my mother is so gonna love her
oh how nice maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison
i’m sorry i totally interrupted you what what what were you saying
just said howard’s a terrific guy he’s got a great sense of humour he loves his mother a lot some people say too much
i really like that you’re such a loyal friend
yeah i am loyal you know if you look at the big picture just out of curiosity did he ever have a shot with you
are you insane the guy was wearing an eye patch
he said that i could drive a car on mars
got it so can i see you again
you’re not gonna see me now
actually i was just checking my email but uh no the rover is not responding
i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any means of propulsion
hang on there’s got to be other options
you could try calling triplea but based on nasa’s latest timetable they won’t get there for 35 years
plus i understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive
ok i guess we have to turn to plan b
erase all the hard drives scrap the surveillance tapes wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run
howard didn’t you say you worked on the mars rover
yeah when we first met you said that if i went out with you i could drive a car on mars
i don’t know what you’re talking about
will you all excuse me leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private
no yeah i remember specifically you started by asking if i was from mars because my ass was out of this world
well that does sound like me but no
yeah listen i have to kinda sneak out for a while
no wait if anyone asks you where i went you don’t know
i can’t tell you that either
so you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask
yeah i really didn’t think this through
if someone and of course we don’t know who this would be does ask where you’ve gone what should i say
i don’t know just tell them i went to the office
are you going to the office
then how can i say it convincingly
just say leonard went to the office
all right leonard went to exaggerated the office
what is no not like that just leonard went to the office
this would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office
see why don’t i believe you
i’m going out for a while
doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going
leonard is going to exaggerated the office
busy i removed an appendix a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel
i’m hoping that’s three different guys
no just the one he didn’t make it so how was your day
oh you know i’m a physicist so i thought about stuff
well i wrote some of it down
if i knew you were waiting i would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole
you’ve reached dr stephanie barnett leave a message beep
hey steph it’s me again howard listen if you’re free friday maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place my mom cooks a hell of a brisket let me know it’s howard
i’ve had her brisket melts in your mouth
maybe we should think about going to the bedroom
that’s a good idea there’s a bed in there and i’m very very very probed
you’ve reached dr stephanie barnett leave a message beep
hey it’s me again just want to let you know the head count for dinner friday has gone up my aunt betty and uncle elliot are coming in from palm springs oh and if anybody should ask you’re halfjewish on your mother’s side okay call me it’s howard
don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested
do you want me to stop and call him back right now
you’ve reached dr stephanie barnett leave a message beep
hey it’s me again howard listen my cousins from fort lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant
tell her we’re going to the olive garden i have a coupon from the paper
we’re not going to the olive garden mom
oh mr bigshot with his red lobster
i’ll call you back when we firm up the details it’s howard
well last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating
so uh what we did was in fact dating
well yeah we did have a date
exactly thank you do me a favour tell koothrappali that next time you see him
oh nice a doctor doctor or a you kind of doctor
doctor doctor surgical resident smart pretty let me ask you something if your friend thinks he’s dating someone but he’s not because in fact you’re dating her does that make you a bad person
well have you slept with her yet you dog good for you
really is that what you do when someone knocks thank you i had no idea opening door hey buddy what brings you to my little slice of hell
you’re gonna have to play outside i’m not dressed to receive
no one cares ma so what’s up
listen i need to talk to you about something
momentito yello oh stephanie thanks for calling me back i was worried… oh… uhhuh… uhhuh… uhhuh… no i understand… sure we can be friends absolutely thanks for calling yeah you have a nice day too to leonard you are dead to me
okay who gets the extra dumpling
okay one of us is going to have to stop putting up spock
howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are for all intents and purposes deceased he intends to act on this by not speaking to you feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence
that’s just ridiculous why are you cooperating with him
i don’t make the rules leonard
howard come on i didn’t plan on this these things just happen usually not to me but they do happen
did someone just feel a cold breeze
i believe this is an extension of the death metaphor the cold breeze is the socalled ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by
you know screw it i’m just gonna eat the dumpling
oh hi steph come on in
yeah but i don’t see a better one on the horizon so…
oh if it isn’t mrs dead to me
look i’m sorry you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence i’m out
he just won’t listen to me
okay i guess it’ll just be the three of us then
yeah my roommate she just went through a really bad breakup and i thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you
leonard stephanie you’re alive it’s a miracle
so anyway lisa i just wanted to tell you again how much i enjoyed the other night and again i’m sorry for how it ended but again if you could let me know about friday my mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get
it’s colloquial a conversation opener so do you find the weather satisfying are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team
what’s wrong with you you’re freaking me out
i’m striking up a casual conversation with you s’u’up
all right but i’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat
so this wasn’t the awkward part
oh good i used that right anyway you’re aware that leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component
her name is dr stephanie barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial
good what he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me
yes see of the handful of women leonard’s been involved with she’s the only one i have ever found tolerable
anyway should you have any interaction with her it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival
yeah i think she’s pretty safe
you say that now but consider the following scenario you’re sitting in your apartment it’s late you’re alone your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate or a uh hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth
yes now should that happen i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido
always nice talking to you sheldon
and you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us
you know italian housewives have a rule of thumb a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked
she doesn’t mean it she’s just being nice
well stephanie since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball i guess i’ll just have to pick it up have you ever witnessed a violent crime
hmm technically not a fruit but all right where did you do your medical internship
uh lawrence memorial in galveston texas
really that’s where i was born
i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital when i was 12 i got to ride there in a helicopter
radiation burns a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner
i’m sorry you tried to build your own cat scanner
no i didn’t try i succeeded in fact i was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig snowball before he caught fire it led to an interesting expression in our house not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner
excuse me when i come back just for fun the subject will be alternative history specifically how would the civil war have gone differently if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future to leonard look at that there’s even pasta left over
do you understand that this was supposed to be a date
i do do you because frankly you’ve been in a foul mood since i sat down
okay here’s my question why did you sit down
to help look if you fail at this relationship and history suggests you will then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed
you’re kirk i’m spock wolowitz is scotty koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed and now we’ve got mccoy
so we’re all standing around looking at the postop x ray and there it is clear as day right in the guy’s chest cavity one of my earrings
oh my god what did you do
what do you think i did i discreetly slipped off the other earring put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there
i have a bone to pick with you sir
hi stephanie i’m sorry i’m late but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation
we’re going to the movies what movie what theatre what time if you were trying to make it impossible to locate you you couldn’t have done a better job
it took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up wait here i’ll find us seats
not the right seats sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting “ha”
he’s finding the acoustic sweet spot
sometimes he brings a toy xylophone i am really sorry about this
no it’s fine you know he’s sweet
my apologies you’ve been sitting in it all along leonard you want to slide over one
leonard knock knock knock  leonard knock knock knock  leonard
what sheldon what sheldon what sheldon
tell me what you see here
the blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial
this is stephanie’s facebook page now where it should say in a relationship what does it say
yeah furthermore earlier this evening she threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike who’s mike why does he get a digital sheep and not you
it’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks
you don’t see it do you we’re losing her
okay i’m going to make this very simple for you you are not in this relationship i am ergo you have no say in anything that happens between me and stephanie
i’m afraid i can’t allow that pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a you are deemed unfit and i hereby relieve you of your command
general order 104 section a does not apply in this situation
give me one good reason why not
because this is not star trek
penny knock knock knock  penny knock knock knock  penny
it’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat
sheldon would you like to come in
i suppose i could spare a few minutes were you robbed
i’m certain this will come as no surprise to you but leonard is failing in yet another relationship
she’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet if i have any hope of keeping them together i need data specifically i need to know exactly what leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks
again urban slang in which i believe i’m gaining remarkable fluency so what is the down and the low and don’t worry this is all entirely confidential so you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom
we never got to the bedroom
oh okay all right you know what i’ll tell you what happened we were young we were very much in love but we could only communicate through a timetraveling mailbox at my lake house
it’s not enough that you made me watch that movie but now you mock me with it
gentlemen i have a question about dating and relationships
you told me you were going to have the talk with him
i’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me
more to the point it’s about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together
oh i don’t think you can
look at leonard’s record 27 days with joyce kim
during which she defected to north korea
two booty calls with leslie winkle
for which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light leonard”
and a three hour dinner with penny
which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down
based on the geometric progression his relationship with stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes
yes i’m aware of the math y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth the issue remains how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection
well if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet
i’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it that doesn’t work at all no matter how much you put on
so that’s all you’ve got apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne
penny knock knock knock  penny
i see apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and leonard crossed some sort of line i apologize
so have you and i returned to a social equilibrium
great new topic where are you in your menstrual cycle
i’ve been doing some research online and apparently female primates you know uh apes chimpanzees you they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female now this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation which brings me back to my question where are you in penny slams door clearly i’m 14 days too early
all i’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance
leonard you’re going to have to let this go you had a little cheese dip you farted i thought it was cute
yeah i assume i’m not driving anywhere tonight sheldon lets out a loud noise
i have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied
excuse me what the hell is wrong with you
when i fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male you see when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin if the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love
huh would it work if i just punched you in the face
yes actually it would but let’s see how the lid goes i’m not strong enough leonard you’ll have to do it
do you want some help with that
no no no i got it
no yeah yeah he’s got it and that’s not surprising this is something i long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male open it leonard tries again then taps jar on counter jar breaks
oh my god are you okay
oh honey you’re going to need stitches
well yeah i mean just a few
oh okay yeah hang on a sec throws up in sink
fyi i was defrosting a steak in there
what a beautiful job stephanie did i might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch but you can’t argue with her results it’s a shame it won’t scar the war wound is a timehonoured badge of masculinity
i can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking
just for the record my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears
i did not burst into tears my eyes just got a little watery
she stuck a needle into my hand
hey how’s my big cry baby
okay i’m just teasing you but yeah you did alright it’s all good what do you say we get you home and put you to bed
oh are you still going to spend the night
uh no i think that you probably need to rest
she’s right as long as you’re vomiting coitus is contraindicated
okay i’m going to go get your discharge papers
well you seem like a perfectly pleasant person i just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you
hey can you open this for me
sure holds out hand howard starts to retch
answering the question once and for all why wolowitz bailed out of medical school
your facebook status update leonard hofstadter is in a relationship
what no no that’s not right
oh man did you switch your status before she did speaking as an expert way to look needy
seriously you went first after only two weeks that’s bold
it’s not bold it’s a mistake i didn’t change my status
i had no choice he cried in front of her
oh it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything kalel
are you insane now she’s going to think i’m desperate you’ve destroyed this relationship and you want to know what the worst part is you don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in
in which i am not an expert
don’t even i don’t want to hear another word out of you
what’s wrong lassie timmy fall down the well he points oh wow she just updated her facebook status
stephanie barnett is in a relationship with leonard hofstadter”
really oh look at that i have a girlfriend
if i am permitted to speak again dr sheldon cooper for the win
i don’t see anything at all sheldon
well you’re the doctor but i am constantly hearing this annoying sound
no it’s more of a relentless narcissistic drone
yup there’s no inflammation at all sheldon
then it must be a tumour
maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies
is that possible i used to get those all the time even in church
well you know if it is from a swirly there’s something i can do okay circle circle dot dot now you have a cootie shot i’m going to bed
it’s not enough that she mocks me but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot
do you understand that stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments
how is it imaginary that i keep hearing an octave above middle c is that imaginary i don’t think so
leonard there’s one more thing under article one section three of our roommate agreement i’m calling an emergency meeting
leonard moves the meeting not occur is there a second none heard the motion fails i’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with dr stephanie
that being said we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together
i beg to disagree “a girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with unquote leonard when she has stayed over for a ten consecutive nights or b more than nine nights in three week period or c
you initialed it see lh lh lh
wait i only initialed it because i never thought it would happen i initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case i get superpowers
hmm yes you did now to review the following provisions are hereby activated in the refrigerator as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal next apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells thirdthe bathroom schedule now i’m given to understand women have different needs so we’ll have to discuss that
at least take this with you look and have stephanie initial here here here here and here this states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve
it’s not a big deal we have latex gloves
i don’t care what the symptoms are my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam
good morning dr stephanie i trust leonard satisfied you sexually last night
oh come on sheldon we don’t ask questions like that
i heard you ask it over and over how is it inappropriate for me to ask it once
see she’s not offended and now you finally have an answer
uhhuh and and and you are
i’m penny i live across the hall i’ve heard a lot about you
i haven’t heard a thing about you leonard why haven’t i heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear
she’s heard about you because we’re you know involved and you haven’t heard about her because… i never slept with her i swear
in leonard’s defence it wasn’t for lack of trying
look i’m just saying um penny is one of our many neighbours you know and in our building neighbours come and go it’s very casual no dress code in fact some mornings i’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with mrs vartabedian
really i have never once been invited to have cereal with mrs vartabedian
she doesn’t like you um well uh you have a gall bladder to remove and i have to get in the shower and penny has clothes to put on so…
well it was very nice meeting you
nice to finally meet you too
what could i possibly have done to offend mrs vartabedian
why do i feel like i’m the one that just got the prostate exam
you know she seems very nice
oh she is she’s terrific and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate
roommate you guys are living together
do i have to pull out the paperwork again
how could i not be sure
don’t you think if a woman was living with me i’d be the first one to know about it
oh sweetie you’d be the last one to know about it looking through his wardrobe hmm cute dresses i bet this looks great on you
okay hmm scented candles fuzzy slippers ooh floral bed sheets
okay moving on now who are these guys at disney world
uh the big dog is goofy and the older couple with the mouse ears  i have no idea we’re not living together
you’re going to go down swinging huh all right well we got your body lotion your instyle magazine your jewellery box
we’re not… where’s my bat signal
i did it was right here she must’ve… oh my god we’re living together
really what was your first clue
yeah stephanie got them for me
actually i think it’s more of wool fire ant blend
so the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you huh sounds serious
it is actually in fact i gave it a lot of thought and i decided it was time for us to live together
uh leonard huge mistake there’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again
at least i have an egg what do you have
a veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners see the blonde over there i can hit on her and you can’t
too bad ’cause she was checking you out before
of course not look at her
i don’t care what you guys think stephanie and i are very happy living together i will give either of you 20 dollars right now to trade pants with me
sheldon what are you doing here
hang on 130 over 80 a little high we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk
where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff
my aunt marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday she thought if i failed at theoretical physics that i should have a trade to fall back on and by the way the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer
didn’t they teach you that in medical school
i understand all i need is for you to authorize these tests
a cardiac stress test a full body mri an electromyogram a cbc baseline glucose upper gi
oh and an exploratory laparoscopy last time i had hiccups it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions
can i at least have the upper gi i already drank the barium
oh good do you have any fabric softener
yeah sure what are you washing a crocodile
no the pants that stephanie got me
oh sweetie you can’t machine wash these they’ll be ruined
oh no i wish you’d told me that sooner
yeah it’s wonderful okay maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly but it’s fine it’s great
okay leonard honey you know if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going you’re allowed to say something
are you sure that doesn’t sound right
believe me your feelings are just as important as hers
no that doesn’t sound right either
just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with
yeah i could say something like that to her i’ll go do that thank you
you have a really good grasp on this maybe you could talk to her
no but that’s okay i’ll go talk to her want to come with
you were right your larynx is terribly inflamed i mean i’ve never seen anything like it
i knew it what do i do
you’re going to need to stop talking immediately
sheldon he waves what’s going on
careful if you don’t get it all it’ll only come back worse
ohoh do we need to talk or do we “need to talk”
i don’t know what that means
okay why don’t you just tell me what it is you have to tell me
okay um well look it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick
well yeah but scary good right
sure when is scary not good but okay um i have feelings right
okay and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings right
of course honey why don’t you tell me what it is you’re feeling
okay well i ju… i think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh shoot i had it
okay how about this how about i tell you what i’m feeling
i just ate aren’t you supposed to wait an hour
oh okay i just hope i don’t get cramps
hey oh i put your clothes in the dryer
so how did the talk with stephanie go
well um on one level really really well
so you told her you wanted to slow things down
not specifically but uh i did tell her that i had feelings
and then the the subject got changed somehow
um little bit she looks at her watch what
nothing okay well it sounds like things are going to work out
yeah yeah it’s all good everything’s going to work out one way or another
come on leonard you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to
yes you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants
nothing just rethinking my whole life okay here’s the thing i’m afraid that if i ask her to move out she’ll just dump me
well it’s a chance you have to take i mean look if it’s meant to be it’ll be
very comforting okay so what do i say to her
i don’t know i mean what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down
i really like you but i want to see how things go with mark
i’m sorry i totally interrupted you what were you saying
oh right yeah um so stephanie here’s the thing i really like you
oh god here comes the speech
i really like you but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‘cause i need my space but i’ll call you on tuesday and then you never call me so i call you but you don’t call me back and then when i run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you’ve been having problems with your voice mail and i know that you’re lying but i pretend like i don’t care even though i’m dying inside
no no no i wasn’t going to say any of that i was just going to say i really like you
oh oh good ‘cause i really like you too
yeah stephanie got it for me it’s kind of fun
it’s got a big bird on it dude
yeah yeah that’s the fun part we’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom and a dust ruffle and a duvet and i don’t even know what a duvet is but i’m pretty sure if i did i wouldn’t want one but every time i talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex
you’re lucky with me it’s usually the other way around
you know if you can’t talk to her why don’t you just text her
it’s true but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater
sold “i think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place” there it’s done
yeah good for me i’ll never have sex again phone buzzes i was wrong see ya
we’re out of herbal tea do you have any
some hiney would be nice too
your argument is lacking in all scientific merit it is well established superman cleans his uniform by flying into earth’s yellow sun which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh
what if he gets something kryptonian on it
i think we can safely assume that all kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet krypton exploded
or it turned into mustard kryptonite the only way to destroy a rogue kryptonian hotdog threatening earth
raj please let’s stay serious here superman’s body is kryptonian therefore his sweat is kryptonian
yeah what about kryptonian pit stains
okay he’s invited for dinner in the bottle city of kandor he miniaturizes himself enters the city where he loses his superpowers now before dinner his host says “who’s up for a little kryptonian tetherball” superman says “sure” works up a sweat comes back to earth his uniform now stained with indestructible kryptonian perspiration
superman would have taken his uniform to a kandorian dry cleaner before he left the bottle
“kandorian dry cl…” i give up you can’t have a rational argument with this man
hey isn’t that the guy who won the macarthur genius grant last year no not all at once
i didn’t get a good look can i go again
so what his observation of highenergy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter
i have two words for you the first is big the other’s whoop
it is a big whoop it made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless
did… okay maybe  some of it but look the guy was just in the right place at the right time with the right paradigmshifting reinterpretation of the universe he got lucky
in more ways than one he’s a very handsome man
doesn’t do anything for me if i was gonna go that way i’m more of a zac ephron kinda guy
oh yeah like you have a shot with zac ephron
excuse me are you leonard hofstadter
yeah dr gablehauser said if i wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab that you’d be able to give me a hand
you want to work with me
well if you have a little time yeah
wow yyeah sure yeah no problem uh here’s my home number here’s my cell here’s my office here’s my parents’ number up in new jersey they always know how to reach me so…
congratulations on the macarthur grant by the way big fan
okay byebye what are you looking atyou’ve never seen a hypocrite before
trailing badly wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with sheldon cooper who is dominating in the ninth frame with a careerbest 68
that doesn’t count do over do over
there are no doovers in wii bowling
there are always doovers when my people play sports
where were you that’s more important than wii bowling night
it’s a rhetorical question there is nothing more important than wii bowling night
come on it’s just a video game and we suck at it
nice motivational speech from the team captain
i was working with dave underhill
ooh “dave” sounds like leonard’s got a new bff
actually he’s pretty cool i mean not only is he a brilliant scientist but it turns out he’s a black diamond skier he collects vintage motorcycles he plays in a rock band
so we’re in a rock band
no we play rock band on our xbox
nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist
he’s funny too he does this hysterical impersonation of stephen hawking having phone sex what are you wearing that’s not he does it better anyway he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow so i’m gonna go practice my situps
hey sheldon are you and leonard putting up a christmas tree
no because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of saturnalia
gather round kids it’s time for sheldon’s beloved christmas special
in the prechristian era as the winter solstice approached and the plants died pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring this custom was later appropriated by northern europeans and eventually it becomes the socalled christmas tree
and that charlie brown is what boredom is all about
okay well thank you for that but i got you and leonard a few silly neighbour gifts so i’ll just put them under my tree
wait you bought me a present
why would you do such a thing
i don’t know ‘cause it’s christmas
oh penny i know you think you’re being generous but the foundation of giftgiving is reciprocity you haven’t given me a gift you’ve given me an obligation
don’t feel bad penny it’s a classic rookie mistake my first hanukkah with sheldon he yelled at me for eight nights
now honey it’s okayyou don’t have to get me anything in return
of course i do the essence of the custom is that i now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me it’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year
okay you know what forget it i’m not giving you a present
no it’s too late i see it that elf sticker says to sheldon the die has been cast the moving finger has writ hannibal has crossed the alps
i know it’s funny when it’s not happening to us
sheldon i am very very sorry
no no i brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life i’m going to need a ride to the mall
thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle
i had no idea it was so heavy the thing just fell right over on me didn’t it
yeah lucky for you it wasn’t moving
oh hey leonard ooh are you okay
oh yeah it’s just a little motorcycle accident
my god how fast were you going
i don’t know it’s all such a blur
ha ha ha good one he couldn’t even get it started hi dave
hi penny so it’s your motorcycle
yeah lucky for the bike it landed on my leg
you mind giving me a hand with speed racer here
oh yeah yeah sure so um dave how do you know leonard
uh well it’s just that the physicists i know are indoorsy and pale
i’m not indoorsy i just wear the appropriate sun block because i don’t take melanoma lightly
so are you and leonard working on an experiment together
yeah we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector
uh sweetie sweetie dave was talking you know i love science
since always call me a geek but i am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing
the last thing i would ever call you is a geek
ha well that’s what i am queen of the nerds
well if you like i could show you the lab we’re working in we’ve got some cool toys you know lasers and stuff
you know i have always wanted to see a big science lab
how ’bout we go see it now maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast we grab a little bite to eat…
umyeah yeah that sounds great let me just get my jacket
yeah if you like that type
really i don’t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it
all right see you tomorrow leonard
see ya ‘bye penny have fun bangs head on door sheldon opens it
yes leonard falls through did you forget your key
i don’t see anything in here a woman would want
you’re kidding you’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps that’s the estrogen hat trick
what it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus bayberry cinnamon and vanilla it’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan
sheldon if you don’t like this stuff let’s just go next door and build her a bear
i told you before bears are terrifying
come on bath stuff it’s perfect you got a scented candle a cleansing buff spearmint and green tea scented bath oil promotes relaxation
she knows you she’s tense we all are buy a basket
no we’re not let’s say for a moment that i accept the bath item gift hypothesis i now lay the following conundrum at your feet which size
you put no thought into that
i’m sorry uh this one let’s go
i have insufficient data to proceed excuse me miss
if i were to give you this gift basket based on that action alone and no other data infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us
here now are we friends colleagues lovers are you my grandmother
i don’t understand what you’re talking about and you’re making me a little uncomfortable
see sounds just like you and penny we’ll take it
oh hey dave and penny what a surprise
hey leonard dave was just showing me around the university you know this place is unbelievable
yeah i know i’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half you always said you had yoga
maybe i heard you wrong a lot of words sound like yoga
this is an amazing woman leonard she has a curious and agile mind not to mention being curious and agile in other respects
yes please shut up so um dave don’t you think you and i should get back to the lab you know that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself
actually i was thinking about taking the afternoon off so i could work on another experiment with penny
really we’re going to do an experiment
uhhuh we’re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22yearold woman
it’s not an experiment you saw what happened last night
yeah oh can i drive the motorcycle
yeah why not you can’t do any worse than leonard
that’s funny by the way my leg is killing me thanks for asking
mmm great news leonard i’ve solved my penny gift dilemma
you see the danger was that i might under or overreciprocate but i have devised a foolproof plan see i will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself feigning digestive distress
it is isn’t it is it okay if i hide them in your room the smell makes me nauseated
thank you that’s very gracious     gentlemen
why couldn’t you have just done what leonard did and get penny a new boyfriend
my leg is killing me thanks for asking
okay i have just one question for you while i am perfectly happy with the way things are between us you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because i was too smart for you well news flash lady david underhill is ten times smarter than me you’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers next to him i’m like one of those signlanguage gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes so my question is what’s up with that
why are you yelling at me
sorry i’m sorry i’m sorry never mind we’re cool
dave is not smarter than you he’s an idiot
really why would you say that
because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend
he tried to take nude photos of you
that’s what you took from that the guy is married
oh yeah i’m so… oh that’s terrible
and you if you are so okay with the way things are between us why are you so jealous
well uh the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible
it’s just rum it stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago
come on it’s christmas just give me this one
by the way my leg is killing me thanks for asking
very good thanks for asking come on in
ah good penny you’re here to exchange gifts you’ll be pleased to know i’m prepared for whatever you have to offer
i should note i’m having some digestive distress so if i excuse myself abruptly don’t be alarmed oh a napkin
to sheldon live long and prosper leonard nimoy
yeah he came into the restaurant sorry the napkin’s dirty he wiped his mouth with it
i possess the dna of leonard nimoy
well yeah yeah i guess but look he signed it
do you realize what this means all i need is a healthy ovum and i can grow my own leonard nimoy
okay all i’m giving you is the napkin sheldon
oh a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons very thoughtful
yeah and i checked not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one
oh then i think you’ll appreciate what i got you
okay 101 totally cool science experiments for kids
you know ’cause you’re so into science
i know it’s not enough is it here
all right that’s the last servo behold the mobile omnidirectional neutralization and termination eradicator or…
featuring one articulated razorsharp killing saw one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 48 seconds
is it wrong to say i love our killer robot
as with my father i both love and fear it
all right enough chitchat let’s destroy something
okay what shall be first to taste the wrath of monte
okay ooh perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the magic eight ball
did it when i was four it’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water
man call spoiler alert before you say things like that
what did the toaster oven ever do to you
what did i ever do to jimmy mullins in the third grade he still punched me in the face with my own fists sorry you little nerd you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time
yeah this is an auspicious moment yeah like robert oppenheimer or neil armstrong we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event
no i think i’m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry monte bursts through boys door penny screams and runs down the stairs
oh yeah they still got the full monte
yeah well it almost killed me
if it wanted to kill you you’d be dead
so who exactly does it want to kill
i’m sorry are you unaware of the upcoming southern california robot fighting league round robin invitational
you know since i moved last year not all my mail has been forwarded
it’s a big deal there’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward perhaps you’d like to come with me i know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there
how is it supposed to be a dance if i’m the only girl
well that may be a slight exaggeration you’d be the only doable girl
how is doable anything but a compliment
howard why don’t we just work on the robot
please leonard not now once again penny and i have begun our little tango
the carnal repartee the erotic to and fro but as delicious as the appetizer might be at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot
look normally i can just ignore you i mean i get it you’re a little peculiar you know like sheldon
yeah excuse me penny but in this room you’re the one who’s peculiar
yeah you might be right but back to you i know you think you’re some sort of smoothtalking ladies’ man but the truth is you are just pathetic and creepy
um so what are you saying
i am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable it’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say “ooh it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that” and most important we are not dancing a tango we’re not to’ing and fro’ing nothing is ever going to happen between us ever
wait a minute this isn’t flirting you’re serious
flirting you think i’m flirting with you i am not flirting with you no woman is ever gonna flirt with you you’re just gonna grow old and die alone
i’m going home to live my creepy pathetic life
well someone had to say it raj whispers in leonard’s ear what
he said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition
here’s a crazy idea ma answer it
hello all right hold on it’s your friend leonard he wants to know why you’re not at school today
i don’t go to school ma i work at a university
that’s a school now pick up the phone
i don’t want to talk to anybody
should i ask leonard to bring over your homework
i don’t have homework i’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering
excuse me mr fancypants want me to get you a popsicle
i ate the cherry all that’s left is green
you make me want to kill myself
i don’t know now they’re just yelling about popsicles sounds like penny really got to him
i’m not surprised despite his hard and crusty shell howard is a very sensitive man do you know he writes poetry mostly about men from nantucket and hermits named dave but he does it with real sensitivity
hey hofstadter word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot
well if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot the kwipke kwippler in the southern california wobot fighting league wound wobin invitational aka the scawflawawi his name is gonna be swrap metal
come on is that really necessary
leonard i believe it is this is trash talk and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events kripke your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution also i’m given to understand that your mother is overweight
now of course if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony i withdraw that comment
what difference does it make fat is fat
tell you what forget the scawflawawi let’s settle this woboto a woboto
there’s no guawantee we’ve gotta go against each other in the wound wobin so let’s thwow down you know unless you’re afwaid
we accept your challenge name a time and place
tomowow thwee o’clock the kinetics wab
no don’t make it so barry we can’t fight you tomorrow our engineer is incapacitated
he’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls
we’re all pathetic and cweepy and can’t get girls that’s why we fight wobots if you’re not there you’ll be exposed to widicule
i’m curious what part of america is that accent from
yeah come on in what’s up
i need you to apologize to how…
come on wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle
well then have the robot go and get him
the robot didn’t hurt his feelings
his feelings needed to be hurt
he’s been in bed for two days
yeah probably with a blowup doll
he’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with the guy is devastated
oh please how could i possibly devastate howard
okay don’t take this as a criticism but you kind of have that overexposedtogammarays thing going on
you know like most of the time you’re the easygoing bruce banner but then when you get angry you kind of turn into like you know grrrrr
seriously gamma rays bruce banner you didn’t get the incredible hulk from that never mind just please go talk to him
and say what that i didn’t mean it because i meant it
well maybe you can go at it from a different angle like um you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine
okay let’s try it this way remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your tv back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that what did you say oh yes you said you owed me one
okay come on that’s not fair
i came home with no pants
fine i’ll go over there tomorrow
thank you i should probably give you a heads up about his mother
she’s a delightful woman you’ll love her
howard there’s a blonde girl patsy here to see you
okay now she’s saying it’s penny
i don’t want to talk to her
she ran past me was i supposed to tackle her
so i just came by to see how you were doing
people move away from her on the bus what do you want
okay look howard i just want to apologize for some things that i have said about you i’ve been informed that you have feelings and apparently i have hurt them so i’m sorry howard
hey i’m a big boy i’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman i mean get over yourself
okay well bye penny leaves room sound of howard crying through door so close goes back in
oh my god that’s kripke’s robot
as you can see the kwippler is weducing the chevy cavawier to wubble
sheldon we have to call it off
we don’t have that option we’ve accepted the challenge we can’t run away from a fight
oh please we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights personally i can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size
impressive as that may be monte is not us monte has no fear
sheldon did we all not just watch the same video kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a midsized automobile
you are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify monte so that he’s prepared
you want to prepare him install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself
excuse me but how are we going to make any modifications without wolowitz have you heard from penny yet
have faith gentlemen we don’t need wolowitz engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics watch and learn do either of you know how to open the toolbox
and then when i was 14 i met marcy grossman she was so beautiful she just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite it was so hot like a sexy little chipmunk i didn’t have the courage to ask her out but i dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show
marcy grossman is sunshine on a cloudy day when it’s cold outside marcy grossman is the month of may…
i guess you’d say what can make me feel this way marcy grossman marcy grossman marcy grossman talkin’ ’bout marcy…
and then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair which brings us to tenth grade
howard do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard
look at me what chance do i have if i don’t try too hard
well you’d have a terrific chance i mean you’re smart you’re funny you have a cool job you build stuff that goes into outer space
look i’m telling you i’ve known you for like a year and a half and this is the first time i feel like i’m talking to a real person and you know what i like him he’s a nice guy
i do howard tries to kiss her she punches him
nice little bot you’ve got here
yep at 3400 rpm it can cut through steel like it was wubber
neat good work sheldon we’ve got to call this off
no leonard for years merciless thugs like kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named indian burns that stops now
but sheldon we don’t have a chance the only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote
what you fail to realize is kripke suffers from a fatal flaw overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power
trust me kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare observe kripke i would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker but as you are its maker clearly the two of you have met
way to bust out the jedi mind tricks dude
i just want to make sure that we’re all clear standard robotic fighting league rules apply
are you cwazy this is a stweet fight the stweet has no rules
he’s right leonard the paradigm is to the death
i will however give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war
never i’d rather see monte dead than in your hands
that could be easily awanged weady set go
come on sheldon you got this
indeed we are prepared for anything he can throw at us a flame begins to jet out of kripke’s robot that’s new
don’t hurt us don’t hurt us
well so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood
i did this monte was killed by my hubris and my pride no matter what anybody says this is my fault
no one’s arguing with you dude
i got your text how bad is… oy
forget the robot what happened to you
yes i slipped and fell in the bathroom bounced right off the tub
yes now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect
yeah they sucker punch you when your eyes are closed
so what do you think howard it’s not that bad right
oh no a little electrical tape some solder are you insane i’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this
you’re right monte’s gone we’ll bury him in the morning a simple ceremony i’ll speak leonard you’ll play your cello
sheldon honey aren’t you getting a little carried away i mean it’s just a toy robot
i know i got it sheldon i’m sorry
well don’t get the wrong idea the way i see it i’m halfway to pity sex
mmm gentlemen i put it to you the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour
first off that is axiomatically wrong because the best pudding is chocolate secondly the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death it is extracted from the plant…
hey i’m thinking of growing a mustache
ah no kidding a fu man chu a handlebar pencil
it is extracted from the plant…
i’m not sure yet you know george clooney has one now
really i once saw him shopping at ralph’s he was buying tequila
oh you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey
alright this is cruel we better let him finish before his head explodes
tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly
it is also indigenous to brazil as is the cocoa bean from which we get chocolate the best pudding and you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore
heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults vewy impwessive
don’t feel bad leonard negative results are still results
alright please don’t cheer me up anymore
c’mon don’t let him get to you it’s kripke
that’s why he eats by himself instead of sitting here at the cool table
hey it’s true kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted but he also controls the new open science grid computer that i need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe
good luck getting time on it the only people he lets use it are his friends
well then the solution is simple i shall befriend him kripke
what’d you say of the idea of you and i becoming friends
i would say i have no intewest in becoming your fwiend
really that seems rather short sighted coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable why don’t you take some time to reconsider
well i think we’re off to a terrific start
there you go now any email from wolowitz will go right into your spam folder
thanks i mean the email doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit
yeah i got the same one and that’s not a bathing suit it’s a tan line
hello this is sheldon cooper i’m leaving a message for barry kripke barry it was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria i saw that you purchased the chef’s salad apparently you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat nevertheless i hope you enjoyed it i’m following up on our pending friendship and i look forward to hearing from you regarding its status sheldon cooper
oh he’s trying to make a new friend
oh really well good for him
well unless he’s makes one out of wood like gepetto i don’t think it’s gonna happen
well how did you guys become friends
there was a flier on the bulletin board at the university roommate wanted whistlers need not apply
i assumed he was joking you’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side
well what about howard and raj i mean how did you become friends with them
i don’t know how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring proximity and valence electrons
well yeah sure when you put it that way but it all worked out right
i suppose i do miss whistling though
oh come on really leonard whistles
penny knock knock knock  penny knock knock knock  pennythis is for you
it’s a questionnaire i devised i’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work so i’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me
yes well that is a good question but is this really the best way to figure it out
yeah i agree the social sciences are largely hokum but short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship this is the best i can do
okay question 1 rank the following aspects of sheldon cooper in order of appeal intelligence ruthless attention to hygiene playfulness java applet writing
i know i may have started off with a fairly obvious one you did an aspect of my most appealing trait playfulness why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1 i’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest it should take you no more than 3 hours
wait how many questions are on this thing
only 211 don’t worry in deference to you i’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level
sheldon honey did you ever consider making friends by being i don’t know pleasant
well that’s certainly a thoughtprovoking hypothesis may i suggest it as the topic for your essay
you answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern a b b a c a b b a c
aw you picked up on that huh
come on there’s over 200 questions and look at some of these things sheldon is to camaraderie as the space shuttle is to blank
there are a number of acceptable answers for example c
hold on i put some real work into that
yes well it’s better than what wolowitz did he drew a raccoon with what appears to be a distended scrotum
it’s kinda cute until you get to the scrotum
what hope do i have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me
sheldon i’m not going to defend a bigballed raccoon
i don’t see how you could
what i’m trying to say is that maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise
well remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet
i did learn how to swim
the skills are transferrable i just have no interest in going in the water
then why learn how to swim
the ice caps are melting leonard in the future swimming isn’t going to be optional but you do bring up an interesting point i don’t have to break new ground here i’m sure much of the research already exists
no no my point is if you want to learn how to make friends then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum meet people talk to them take an interest in their lives
that’s insane on the face of it come on
you’re driving me to the mall i’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking
why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there
coping with the death of a loved one my condolences
too bad if it’d been a friend i’m available to fill the void woman moves away it’s just as well she smelled like moth balls
okay if you’re gonna start sniffing people i’m gonna go get a hot pretzel
excuse me do you have any books about making friends
i assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred
oh my that’s awfully sticky alright let’s see bernie bunny has two daddies now it’s probably about homosexual rabbits jerry the gerbil and the bullies on the bus read it not helpful oh here we go stu the cockatoo is new at the zoo author sarah carpenter lives in fort wayne indiana with her husband and best friend mark and their cockatoos too hardly makes her an expert in making friends wouldn’t you agree
me too most people don’t see it what are you reading
somewhat anthropomorphized but yes say maybe sometime you and i can go see monkeys together would you like that
i’m making friends with this little girl what’s your name
hi rebecca i’m your new friend sheldon
we were really hitting it off
i’m curious in the “how well do you know sheldon” section what do you put for his favourite amino acid
damn it i had lysine and changed it
oh good you’re just in time i believe i’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends
sheldon there is no algorithm for making friends
hear him out if he’s really on to something we can open a booth at comiccon make a fortune
see my initial approach to kripke had the same deficiencies as those that plagued stu the cockatoo when he was new at the zoo
yes he’s new at the zoo
it’s a terrific book i’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process
have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment
hello kripke yes sheldon cooper here it occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because i hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… i see well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage popular choices include tea coffee cocoa… i see no no no wait don’t hang up yet what about a recreational activity i bet we share some common interests tell me an interest of yours really on actual horses tell me another interest of yours oh no i’m sorry i have no desire to get in the water until i absolutely have to tell me another interest of yours
uhoh he’s stuck in an infinite loop
mmhmm mmhmm it’s interesting but isn’t ventriloquism by definition a solo activity yeah tell me another interest of yours hmmm is there any chance you like monkeys what is wrong with you everybody likes monkeys hang on kripke checking changes howard has made to his flowchart a loop counter and an escape to the least objectionable activity howard that’s brilliant i’m surprised you saw that
gee why can’t sheldon make friends
alright kripke that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and i would like to propose that we do that together tomorrow yes i’ll pay alright goodbye alright time to learn rock climbing
you know i am a fan of ventriloquism maybe you me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage he could talk while you drink
nope i wanna climb some wocks
this appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop no one expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapeons
hardly fear of heights is illogical fear of falling on the other hand is prudent and evolutionary what would you say is the minimum altitude i need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship
come on they have birthday parties here wittle kids climb this
little kid hominids perhaps to man who attaches him to ropes is this your entire job your parents must be so proud
coming kripke okay harness seems to be secure small amount of incontinence just now but the website said that’s to be expected hey this isn’t so bad a bit like vertical swimming
hey look at you cooper you’re almost halfway to the top
i am i was wrong it is a fear of heights
not really i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote
what part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand
understood all that i’m not a mowon just keep going
yeah i don’t think i can
no that doesn’t seem any more likely
well it’s not exactly a plan but i think i’m going to pass out
i’m sorry can we please just do it one more time
okay 1 2 1 2 3 and… leonard howard and raj whistle “sweet georgia brown” together
it’s a little thing but you really do miss it
hello everyone i brought my new friend barry kripke home for dinner
he passed out just hung there like a big sawami
ooh you have a special spot what kind of wacko are you
be right back i gotta fwoss the indian food out of my teeth if i’m gonna eat chinese
oh yes i pass out all the time but it was worth it i’ve made substantial progress in bonding with kripke which brings me to an awkward moment
maintaining five friendships promises to be a herculean task so i’m going to have to let one of you go
me me let it be me
leonard you are my roommate my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer you are safe
don’t be silly howard you do not have a phd your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the jewish high holidays
oh come on what do i have to do
okay you know what i see where this is going i’m not one of you guys i’m not a scientist so just…
penny penny penny everything you’re saying is true but please allow me to continue raj you’re out the good question while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing how could you for a moment think that my favourite amino acid is glutamine
he had lysine but changed it
i like to fwoss before i eat so my gum pockets are open for new food
hewo how did i walk past you i’m bawy
yeah it’s not a vewy hot name i’m gonna call your woxanne ooh pot stickers
suddenly i’m looking pretty good huh
so uh kripke i was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer
i’m confused i was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine
no that’s wong there’s an official schedule i have no contwol over it
oh this entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility raj you’re back in he likes monkeys
you gotta give him credit for sticking with it
i didn’t think he had it in him
he almost made it to the top this time
the problem appears to be unsolvable
maybe you could run some computer simulations
there are too many variables it would take forever
we’ve got to be missing something let’s start again the movie is playing here at 7
right these theatres have to be eliminated
why they’re stateoftheart digital projection 20channel surround sound
yes but they have no icee machines despite my aggressive letterwriting campaign i might add
what about the multiplex here the seats are terrific
they have twizzlers instead of red vines no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that
well it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat and i don’t see a sheldonapproved restaurant proximate to a sheldonapproved theatre
we could eat after the movie
unacceptable the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work
hang on hang on there’s a 7eleven here we smuggle slurpies which are essentially icees in under our coats after having a pleasant meal either here here or here
wow i don’t see how we missed that
excuse me in what universe are slurpies icees
sheldon would you be prepared on a nonprecedential basis to create an emergency adhoc slurpieicee equivalency
oh leonard you know i can’t do that
okay i guess we only have one option
yep i don’t see any way around it
they’re right it was the only option
ooh ooh shut the door shut the door
just do it penny runs in sheldon shuts door penny opens door again get inside and shut the door
he went to the movies without me it was the only option i’m sorry i don’t understand which social situation this is could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed
the building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs and i haven’t paid my rent
oh i see penny i’m not sure i’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 north los robles corporation
it’s no big deal i’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down
if you recall i pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago
well the “check engine” light is fine it’s still blinking away it’s the stupid engine that stopped working it cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it
you know it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money
yes it occurs to me too
hang on a moment he opens a jar snakes jump out he then pulls out a large wedge of money here take some pay me back when you can
wow you got a lot of money in there
that’s why it’s guarded by snakes take some
this is money i’m not using
but what if you need it
my expenses account for 469 of my aftertax income the rest is divvied up between a small savings account this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowedout buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection or her own protection take some
really i mean are you sure
i see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like wolverine
okay well thank you oh god no i can’t sheldon honey i don’t want things to be weird between us
won’t it also be weird if i have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water
i’ll pay you back as soon as i can
of course you will it’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality
you know i’ve given the matter some thought and i think i’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of superintelligent aliens
of course that’s how you move a conversation forward
the learning opportunities would be abundant additionally i like having my belly scratched
great i hope i’m a waitress at the cheesecake factory for my whole life
penny you appear to have a package here
oh thanks this must be the beret i ordered a couple of months ago it was backordered
did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms another fascinating example is the epaulet
he’s not lying he does find that fascinating
okay whatever it’s not like i’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets i bought one like a month ago and it was backordered look it finally arrived all right
oh my god would you just get off my case
oh good that was an unusual interaction i wasn’t sure
did you guys have an argument
well you clearly did something to aggravate her
i’m at a loss if you like you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder i overlooked
here you go oh you owe me another two dollars the price of mushu pork went up
it’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad jew
here you go penny shrimp with lobster sauce
thank you leonard what’s my share
don’t worry about it it’s my treat
well which is it ten or eleven
fourteen fifty but it’s no biggie you’ll get the next one raj whispers something to howard
he was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free
what are you saying that i’m using my body to get dinner that i’m some kind of chinese food prostitute
yeah raj what are you saying
‘cause let me tell you something buddy i pay my own way in this world okay i don’t rely on anybody raj runs out of the room what was that about
he has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out kind of like a puppy
here leonard ten eleven twelve uh fourteen dollars
it was fourteen fifty but it’s okay
yes dinner’s here and i’m having some i’m having takeout food
you’re damn right it’s okay i’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days and i wanted something different so sue me
forgive me penny but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit
sheldon look i will pay you back as soon as i can you just have to give me more time
oh wait you lent her money
she needed money you seem under pressure did i not lend you a sufficient amount because i can give you more
oh you know you would just love that wouldn’t you yeah you would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills
going home where i won’t be interrogated like a criminal i forgot my fortune cookie
in case either of you have larceny in your heart you should know that i’ve moved my money out of the snake can
but if you’re ever short there’s always a couple of fifties in green lantern’s ass
yeah when i didn’t pay my bill the department of water and power thought i would enjoy the ambience
yeah they’re very considerate that way
i used sheldon’s money to pay my rent then i had like fourteen dollars left over
put it back in your pocket or i’ll find some other place to put it
back in the pocket it goes look you do understand that sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back it’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to you know kill him
yeah well that’s not really my big problem
so you’re a little behind on your bills everybody gets behind on their bills
yeah i know it’s just this wasn’t the plan it wasn’t supposed to go this way
um waitress for six months and then become a movie star
it’s probably not as bad as you think let’s take a look maybe we can find some corners to cut oh here’s something if you don’t have electricity then you probably don’t need cable just a suggestion 170 dollars for acting classes
oh no i can’t give up my acting classes i’m a professional actress
you’ve had an acting job where you got paid
that is not the definition of professional
actually it kind of… let’s keep looking whoa what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the los angeles county superior court
nothing it sounds like you got caught speeding going 4000 miles an hour
yeah he got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car
anyway he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant so i you know i paid his fines
and that’s based on the inherent creditworthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles
leonard i’m not gonna call up kurt and ask him for money
well what are you gonna do
i don’t know but i may have to find a cheaper place to live
oh no oh you don’t want to do that
well moving is a big deal you have to go to the supermarket and get boxes and if they’re not clean then your books smell like melons and it’s just like… why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here
well i’m sure the guy living with sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you
oh leonard honey if we started living together i wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you
and you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money
ugh this mushu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum
hey do i mock you with the bhagavadgita every time you scarf down a whopper
we’re on a quest through the valley of fire to acquire the sacred crown
you want the valley of fire it’s right here
hey you guys want to go on a real live quest
– come on it’ll be fun
do you guys remember penny’s exboyfriend kurt they all hold their hands above their heads yeah that’s him it turns out he owes penny a lot of money and i’m gonna go get it from him
really you’re just gonna let me go by myself
oh cool i got a sword
you guys are unbelievable you play a game to simulate adventure but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world you just wimp out
leonard do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman we returned home without pants
are you sure because your proposal suggests that you don’t
all right leonard fairly calls the question who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting penny’s steroidinfused exboyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him say hi to kurt for us
excuse me when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor didn’t samwise pippin and merry go with him
they had a terrible time of it leonard
plus no one stole their pants
fine just enjoy your little game i’ll make this quest on my own
leonard wait take a jacket it’s spritzing a little
you guys suck leaves comes back come on please he’s so big
okay is everyone clear on the plan
yes koothrappali’s going to wet himself i’m gonna throw up sheldon’s gonna run away and you’re going to die shall we synchronize our watches
guys there are four of us and one of him
which means his triumph will be even larger minstrels will write songs about him
okay how about this i’ll do the talking you just stand behind me and try to look formidable
i should’ve peed before we left
i don’t really go by lenny but that’s okay um you remember sheldon howard and raj
you don’t remember me how could he not remember me
okay here it is penny’s in kind of a financial jam and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems
and she sent you to get it from me
no no she’s too proud to ask for the money i on the other hand feel you should honour your debt
feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word um i just think it would be a nice gesture on your part
she’ll get it when she gets it
well there you go problem solved
a successful quest now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom
no the problem isn’t solved he just blew us off
i’ve got it he didn’t remember me because the last time we met i was in a halloween costume
no you can leave if you want to i’m gonna see this through
i guess technically that was my fault knocks i’m not leaving here without penny’s money
i don’t need backup i have right on my side and i’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants
congratulations you may not have succeeded in getting cash but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt leonard has “i owe penny 1800 kurt” written on his forehead
maybe we should have your head notarized
if anybody cares i still have to pee
it’s kind of a fashionable look these days
maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat
sheldon here is your money thank you very much it helped a lot
darn i can’t seem to get the hang of that
hey i know it’s none of my business but where did the money come from
well i cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant but the biggest thing was out of the blue kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me
yes he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right
that’s it did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany
nope i just think he’s really changed we’re having dinner tomorrow night and i get to wear my new beret bye guys
well done leonard the true hero doesn’t seek adulation he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature
penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an exboyfriend and i have indelible ink on my forehead
that’s your badge of honour your warrior’s wound if you will i was wrong minstrels will write songs about you
there once was a brave lad named leonard with a fififiddledeedee he faced a fearsome giant while raj just wanted to pee
penny come on we were just finding our sound
you found it it’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower
i’m really very busy is there any way that we can put this off until i have more time to prepare of course but uh you understand my trepidation
can’t we just postpone it till the spring maybe next summer
this should be fairly easy to deduce he’s holding the phone to his left ear ears do not cross hemispheres so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller
no i didn’t realize it had been so long sure i guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it
he’s referring to an activity he has done before it’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated this suggests some sort of invasive medical test like perhaps a colonoscopy
aren’t there any other options there’s not a lot of room it’s gonna be uncomfortable
yes yes yeah i’m definitely going with colonoscopy
okay bye my mother’s coming to visit
how about that you were right
yes i can read the sign i’m just pondering the implications
i think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work
again i can read the sign but the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional for a significant amount of time which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the i assume 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality
uh i’m penny i’m his neighbour
oh you’re a hand shaker interesting
uh why don’t you come with me i’ll walk you to the apartment
oh all right would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way
okay you know i’ve always been curious what was leonard like when he was little
oh i think you mean young he’s always been little
right okay what was he like when he was young
you’ll have to be more specific
oh um okay like five or six five
oh well at that age he was well enmeshed in what freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development an outmoded theory of course but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis
yeah leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist
well that is one of my degrees my primary field is neuroscience
well there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity
yeah i don’t know what that means
well it means you value yourself only as others value you which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs
oh well i had a wonderful childhood
i know my dad wanted a boy i just i tried being good at sports but i hated getting dirty
and then i’m assuming you entered adolescence
uhhuh he called me slugger until i got my first training bra and then he just stopped playing catch with me i wasn’t slugger anymore your mother’s here
if you want to have intercourse with that girl find out what kind of cologne her father wore
i have the same problem with him my theory is that his lack of focus stems from an overdeveloped sex drive
oh i don’t know where he would’ve gotten that aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage his father and i only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction
that seems a fairly efficient arrangement
yes we think so we’ve both done papers on it mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological mine of course was the only one worth reading
of course i would very much like to read about your sex life
well it’s all online or you can order it from the princeton university press
here’s your tea mother so what are you guys talking about
the frequency with which your parents had intercourse
swell if you’re lucky maybe she’ll show you the powerpoint presentation
i’m sorry it’s on my other laptop
you’ll have to be more specific
all right uh what’s new with you
oh well i’ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently
his heart stopped beating i have to urinate
yeah i i thought you guys might hit it off
i hate to tell you but the only warm memories i have of my childhood are of my uncle floyd
you’re clearly misremembering your mother is brilliant analytical insightful and i’m betting she never hit you with a bible because you wouldn’t eat your brussels sprouts
sheldon you don’t give your mother enough credit she’s warm she’s loving she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training
you were lucky when i was a kid if i wanted an eeg i had to attach my own electrodes
so dr hofstadter leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister
i understand that unlike leonard they’re at the top of their respective fields
well leonard’s younger brother michael is a tenured law professor at harvard and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon
so she’s close to curing diabetes
why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon
wow you must be very proud
why they’re not my accomplishments i have to urinate
you know the rules you brought your mom to work you must suffer
leonard i had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you
yeah you’re like the jar jar binks of the hofstadter family
oh meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad
you know rather than mock me my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it
nope i think mocking you is more fun
next time don’t yousa bring mama to work okeeday
oh the middle stall was occupied i’ll have to try again later
it’s totally understandable in bladder voiding as in real estate it’s location location location
howard lives with his mother and raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk go
that’s fascinating selective mutism is quite rare on the other hand an adult jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché
it’s just temporary i pay rent
he lives in the same room where his bassinet was
you know both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one’s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women it might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy
say what raj whispers in his ear that’s basically what i just said
you brought your husband to work you know the rules meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too betcha betcha
leonard it’s one o’clock weren’t you going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock
there’s no hurry mother tell them more about their secret love for each other
but it’s one o’clock you were going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock
her reasoning is unassailable it is one o’clock
fine let’s go i think you’ll find my work pretty interesting i’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the italians
well what’s the point of my seeing it i could just read the paper the italians wrote
just for the record we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship
well then why didn’t you say that to her
why is it always my responsibility
it’s not always your responsibility i swear this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week
i can’t believe you’re bringing that up
i didn’t bring it up you did
you always say that but we never do
you went to the comic book store without me7
come on in wait wait she’s not gonna come here looking for you is she
oh relax she took sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan
nothing mother likes looking at brains and sheldon likes getting his brain scanned
she’s only been here a day and a half and i’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path
hey i talked to her for five minutes yesterday and i’ve been half bombed ever since
you can’t let her get into your head
it’s too late for me my head is her summer house
she was right you know the locus of my identity is totally exterior to me
oh yeah there she is hi mom
i mean do you know where i was all morning auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial and for what so i’ll finally get my daddy’s approval
no they said i was too perky
hey you want to talk about not getting love from a parent you know what i used to do when i was little to have some sensation of human contact
yeah you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go your mother told me
of course she did anyway that’s not what i was gonna say when i was ten years old i built a hugging machine
yeah i got a dressmaker’s mannequin i stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm and built two radiocontrolled arms that would hug me and pat my back
you know what the saddest part was
my father used to borrow it
your scan data will be very elpful to my research you have a remarkable brain
i know although i’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures
common complaint among men nothing’s ever big enough except when they get a tumour then you never hear the end of it
i’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime
oh i’ll send you a link but its physiology is fairly unimpressive
your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery
my apologies i’ve been living with your son too long gotten into some bad habits
can i make you a cup of tea
i doubt it but if anyone has a chance it’s probably you
i feel very comfortable around you
i feel very comfortable around you too
it’s surprising because i generally don’t feel comfortable around well anyone
what are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son
is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math
i’d like to do the math
you’re gonna lick the salt off my neck do the shot and then bite the lime
i’m sorry i didn’t hear anything after lick
neck shot lime leonard starts licking her neck he is there a long time okay shot lime
right ah where’s the lime penny has the lime in her mouth oh okay we’re sharing
i’m very tempted i’m just not sure it’s appropriate with my son’s roommate
normally i’d feel the same way but based on everything i’ve observed about us i can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together
true i’ve had a similar observation it’s certainly something i could never do with my husband
i was hesitant the first time i tried it but i experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins it’s quite satisfying
i see what you’re doing you’re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me
you see right through me don’t you
only when you’re in a cat scanner
honey shush shush shush shush shush
you shush i’m happy i want to talk about it you know what my mother would say about this she would say because you were not loved by your father and i was not loved by my mother that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children
why would you bring that up right now
so you’re saying you’re not having sex with me you’re having sex with your mother
ummm i’m gonna go with “no”
that is the sickest thing i’ve ever heard
come on you’re trying to have sex with your father and i’m okay with that
she said shush i should have shushed enters apartment sheldon and beverley are inside duetting on journey’s “any way you want it” on rock star
all right mother um have a nice flight
that’s not really in my control is it oh uh yes gives him a very uncomfortable hug
look i was just coming over to talk to you
goodbye leonard so slugger shall we pick up where we left off last time
i mean my mom could’ve just said “bob get over it she’s a girl move on” but she didn’t not one word
interesting would you be willing to fly to new jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan
god i love the smell of paintballs in the morning
there’s no way we can get to the ridge the chemistry department has us completely cut off
but what about the creek bed
the pharmacology department controls that and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids
well that’s it then we’re doomed
i think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my physics department paintball strategy meeting
i told you my mom has spider veins i had to take her to the laser clinic
and i told you i wanted to see a doctor’s note
we need a plan how about operation hammer of the gods
i forget which one is hammer of the gods
we hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee
no go the dumpsters are deep in astronomy department territory
no that shouldn’t be a problem venus is up during the day they’re probably just all staring at the sky
all right what we need now is a tactical retreat did you see the episode of stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on earth’s athens and sparta not important leonard raj and i are going to burst out the door and run away howard will cover us
why don’t i run away and you cover me
because you chose your mother’s veins over victory on three one two three go
i had to take her it’s almost bathing suit weatheranother player bursts through the door
where’s the rest of your squad
ah they left me here to die what about yours
don’t be it was friendly fire they just wouldn’t listen
well we’re surrounded so i guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed
hmm that’s the worst part the waiting
all the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it
yeah the big wet ball of death kind of makes you feel more alive doesn’t it
i say we make every moment count
i agree how exactly do we do that leslie kisses him
howard why aren’t you covering us we’re getting slaughtered out here
did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning
unacceptable it baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research
you know what baffles me sheldon
based on your academic record any number of things i would imagine
howard i got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted
you scratch my back i scratch yours rawr
oh uh no big deal they gave leslie control of some unrestricted grant money
yeah okay but what’s with the backscratching and the meow
i believe the backscratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action
the mrow that sounded to me like an african civet cat
no despite what the name suggests the civet cat is not a true cat now i’m done
you know what i’m thinking i’m thinking howard wasn’t making a backscratching metaphor i’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved
okay i didn’t want to say anything ’cause i know you and leslie have a little history
great ’cause i’ve been dying to say something
is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals
my good man dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a courtmartial offense
courtmartial schmortmartial leslie winkle is the fifth girl i’ve ever had sex with i mean for free
and plus you got a rapid prototyper that’s an expensive piece of equipment dude
and the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone
okay one way to look at this is that i’m getting new equipment and you’re not and that’s unfair but a better way to look at this is that i’m getting sex and you’re not and that’s delightful
the whole thing froze i don’t know what happened
calm down we’ll figure it out
how can i calm down i’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart that’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell
are you planning on sitting here
no i’m going to the comic book store
then what difference does it make
that is my spot in an everchanging world it is a single point of consistency if my life were expressed as a function on a fourdimensional cartesian coordinate system that spot at the moment i first sat on it would be zerozerozerozero
boy i love him but he is one serious wackadoodle
oh thank you you are a lifesaver
that’s a lot of shoes you ordered
yeah you know the sad thing is it’s really not ooh is this one of those paintball guns
yeah you ought to come out with us sometime
oh no thanks i’m from nebraska when we shoot things it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone gun goes off and shoots three paint pellets onto sheldon’s spot
boy your heart’s racing i must’ve really gotten you going
well it’s partly you partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia
can i assume that you likewise found the experience…
that wasn’t quite the word i was looking for but sure i’ll do this passfail
hey are you enjoying that prototyper i got you
oh it’s great everybody in the engineering department is eating their hearts out
isn’t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable
you know most people don’t get that
book club was cancelled that thing on phyllis’s neck opened up again
too busy to help your mother with her zipper
okay then you kids have fun use protection
oh what are we gonna do
we no no no you had your chance to be we for like a year and a half now right now you are you and you are screwed
why do we have to tell him i did it
well we’re not gonna tell him i did it
okay okay how about this we tell him somebody broke in
just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun
i’m sorry i buy it all those people are on drugs
we could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend
okay fine well what if we just flip it over there looks fine right
mm butt print there’s no discernible butt print
oh come on sits and wriggles around there butt print
it’s too small and too perfect
sheldon how was the comic book store
fine the new issue of flash is out
great great did you walk the whole way it’s a little chilly
isn’t that terrific he is such a good friend you know what the best thing about friends is
they don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason
no no friends forgive the little things
you know i gotta go home and wash my hair
hello fastest man alive want to see me read your entire comic book want to see it again something’s wrong
i’m not sure it doesn’t feel right
i don’t know what you’re talking about oh that penny did that
why don’t you just eat in your desk chair
why don’t i just eat in my desk chair
that is my desk chair that is where i work i don’t eat in my desk chair and i don’t work in my spot i work in my desk chair and eat in my spot
you know there’s kind of an obvious solution here to raj get up raj does howard moves his cushion across to sheldon’s spot there problem solved raj whispers to him nobody cares where you’re going to sit you’re not crazy
excuse me but the problem is not solved if your head had been accidentally amputated and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place would that be “problem solved”
if it were your head it would be
sheldon i am really really sorry but it’s only for a week can’t you be a little bit flexible yeah sorry i didn’t really think that through
you claim it’s going to be a week but i have no faith in your dry cleaner
did you notice the sign on his counter he’s not a fulltime dry cleaner he also makes keys
focus is important was michael debakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants did alexander fleming moonlight as a hairdresser “thanks for discovering penicillin now how about we try a bouffant”
ooh looks like i’m gonna have sex tonight hey baby…
his right hand is calling him
no it’s leslie winkle it’s a long story
i’ll pick you up in ten minutes gentlemen adieu
i thought we were going to play halo tonight
what am i supposed to do leonard there’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me you understand right
nevertheless i must depart by the way did i tell you leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to geneva to check out the cern supercollider
that’s not fair you’re not even a physicist
okay there are two ways of looking at this…
thank you it helps when i get to practice with a real woman
hey listen saturday my sister’s getting married i i want you to come with me it’s black tie
yeah gee i’d really rather not
when i go to weddings it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids i don’t know what i would do with a date
hey i’m really sorry about that geneva trip
oh didn’t you hear i had to reduce the number of people going and you didn’t make the cut
well hold on are you saying if i don’t go to the wedding i can’t go to geneva
actually i’m trying not to say it
okay i’m sorry but that makes me a little uncomfortable
because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips
well if i weren’t controlling you with new equipment and research trips then i’d be uncomfortable
‘cause then we’d be in like a real relationship with feelings and all that crap
so bottom line i’m just a boughtandpaidfor sex toy
no no not at all you’re also arm candy so what do you think
hey ma you got to rent me a tux
right now what kind of sex are you having up there
this is my spot where else am i supposed to crouch
here you go fresh from the cleaners good as new
really great sheldon look good as new
from that key maker i highly doubt it
come on sheldon just give it a try
there nice and comfy cosy zero zero zero
there’s one more zero you forgot the time parameter
what do you mean nope what’s wrong with it
nothing it’s what’s wrong with him
penny penny i think i know what to do sheldon i have some bad news
i’m afraid so you know the cashew chicken i get you monday nights
szechuan palace closed two years ago
what whwhere did my cashew chicken come from
no no this isn’t right our food always comes in szechuan palace containers
yeah well before they went out of business i bought 4000 containers i keep them in the trunk of my car
i thought that might take his mind off the cushion
what’s real what isn’t how can i know
you did make that up right
oh god i wish i had
i still don’t like this cushion
okay first of all penny thank you for coming
penny is an amazing shot i think we have a real chance to win this week
okay now we all run out sheldon and i will cut to the left behind these trees raj howard and leslie flank to the right behind the rocks then we’ll all have a great view as penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight
right just one thing before we start
what is it sheldon sheldon shoots penny
sheldon penny was our only hope
i’m sorry leonard but revenge is a dish best served cold
she can’t shoot me she’s dead
he’s right you can’t shoots sheldon
well if we’re going to descend into anarchy shoots leonard
okay raj hand me the number six torque screwdriver
stop we can’t do this it’s not right
sheldon you have two choices either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the tivo or you delete stuff before we go out of town
but once you open the box you’ve voided the warranty the warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer he offers to stand by his equipment and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware this little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy
okay then we won’t touch the hard drive we’ll just erase the first season of battlestar
here you go leonard is this going to be big enough
for taking daffodils to your unicorn
it’s just for my notebooks thanks penny
oh i love san francisco i wish i was going with you
i understand your envy this is a can’tmiss symposium there are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices the advancements in multithreaded task completion plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms
when i go i usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars
this conference is kind of a big thing the keynote address is being delivered by george smoot
oh my god the george smoot
george smoot is a nobel prizewinning physicist one of the great minds of our time his work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe
it’s kind of a funny name though smoot
it’s like talking to a chimp
okay now that i’ve been completely insulted have a good flight
we’re not flying we’re taking the train
yeah cool seven times as long as flying and costs almost twice as much
well then why are you doing it
well we had a vote three of us voted for airplane sheldon voted for train so we’re taking the train
don’t say it like that leonard say it like
hey we’re all going over to the apple store to make fun of the guys at the genius bar you want to come
oh i always enjoy that but i’m a little busy
i’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip see by attaching rfid tags to my clothing it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand i will then crossreference them against destination anticipated activity spectrum weather conditions duration of trip et cetera
well that does sound much simpler how long is this going to take
assuming i can keep up this pace three hours 11 minutes and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation
wow teasing the guys at the apple store seems a little redundant now
i wouldn’t expect you to i’ll see you later
socks one pair cotton argyle blue socks one pair cotton argyle blue
what on earth are you doing
whatever it is i’m guessing we’re doing it wrong
gentlemen this is the coast starlight one of the great american trains operating on one of the classic american routes on this side you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation while on your side you’ll be treated to 350 miles of costcos jiffy lubes and cinderblock homes with aboveground pools
that’s over the wheelbase are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre1980 pullmanbuilt superliner deluxe passenger coach
sheldon we’ve been on this train 90 seconds and you’ve already said a thousand words just tell us where to sit and shut up
here i’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clicketyclack of steel wheels on polished rails your sour disposition will abate
yeah maybe meanwhile back in the 21st century people are raising their tray tables and putting their seatbacks in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in san francisco
it’s not so bad really at least these trains have modern plumbing in india you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of rajasthan
he is referring of course to third class on indian railways’ magnificent ranakpur express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from maharashtra to the bikaner junction
oh look now he’s boring on an international scale
is that who i think it is
it can’t be what would summer glau be doing riding the train
maybe john connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil terminator
unlikely that’s a television show leonard
of course if skynet actually did exist in the future a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send terminators back posing as actors who have played terminators in popular films and television series lulling us into a false sense of security ie that’s summer glau from the sarah connor chronicles no summer don’t kill me i’m prorobot ahh
at least he’s off the train crap
sheldon i owe you an apology taking the train was a stroke of brilliance i’ve actually got a shot at a terminator
oh pleasewhen it comes to terminators you’ve got a better shot of scoring with arnold schwarzenegger
you’re overlooking something i have 11 hours with her in a confined space unless she’s willing to jump off a moving train tuck and roll down the side of a hill she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is howard wolowitz
my money’s on tuck and roll
i’m confused i thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with leslie winkle
sheldon let me explain to you how this works
hang on a sec why do you get first crack at her
um well let’s see couple reasons one i saw her first
fair enough but then let me move on to number two unlike you i can actually talk to women when i’m sober
you fail to take into account that even mute i am foreign and exotic while you on the other hand are frail and pasty
well you know the old saying pasty and frail never fail
excuse me but what about me why don’t i get a shot
fine go ahead take a shot
you know i’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at i can’t score with i think i’ll let you two take this one
sheldon is there a place on this train to get alcohol
interesting that you ask the coast starlight recently added the refurbished pacific parlour car built in 1956 and originally known as the santa fe lounge car the lower level is a theatre…
and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as portland
so aren’t you going to go talk to her
i will i’m just working on my opening line
she’s probably heard every possible line howard why don’t you just try hello
no no no that always creeps girls out i need to come up with something that’s funny smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature
you’re going to need more than 11 hours
so we have to go back
okay sheldon i’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because i forgot my flash drive
you don’t understand my flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of mtheory effects in the early universe that i was going to give to george smoot at the conference
why do you have to give your paper to george smoot
it’s brilliant he needs to read it
so you’ll send him an email when we get back
then i won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it
oh this is an unmitigated disaster
well there’s nothing you can do about it so relax sit back enjoy the clicketyclack of the steel wheels on the polished rails
you forgot your flash drive you forgot your flash drive repeated over and over in time to the sound of the train
only ten hours 55 minutes to go
it’s hot in here must be summer walks towards her then walks straight past returns makes to talk to her then turns to two nuns over the other side of the corridor so where you gals headed
okay i’ve found the perfect solution we get off the train at the next stop in oxnard we then take the 1
are you going to be sarcastic
boy you take all the fun out of it for me  but look penny’s home why don’t we just call her have her go in the apartment get your flash drive and email you the paper
but the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk
the key is hidden in my room
penny would have to go into my room
people don’t go in my room
i see well it seems once again you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place
oh i hate when that happens
it’s hot in here it must be summer it’s hot in here must be summer it’s hot in here must be summer
it’s hot in here must be summer
really i just made it up have you seen slumdog millionaire
it’s loosely based on my life
yeah we’re putting the play on for one night in this little 99seat theatre can you come oh great do you know 98 other people that might want to come oh hang on switches to another line hello
listen carefully i’m about to give you a set of instructions which you must follow to the letter
just a sec switches back to first line the theatre is above a bowling alley so it’s a little noisy but it might be the only chance i’ll ever get to play anne frank and the director is brilliant he uses the bowling sounds as like nazi artillery okay great i’ll see you then switches line again hello
okay step four do you see that small plastic case on my dresser
oh hey sheldon how is san francisco
i’m not in san francisco i’m on a train were you even listening to me
uh no i was talking to my friend but what’s up
what’s up i’ll tell you what’s up i’m in a crisis situation and i need you to marshal your powers of concentration limited as they may be…
give me the phone hi penny it’s leonard
hey leonard what’s going on with dr wackadoodle
he’s calling to ask you a favour you might be confused because he didn’t use the words penny sheldon please or favour
okay enough chitchat okay step one locate your emergency key to our apartment step two enter our apartment step three enter my bedroom
oh hang on sheldon getting another call
no leonard let me tell you something personal robots cannot get here soon enough
and that bright little star peeking her head out early today that’s venus
that is so cool you really know a lot about space
come on when you were on tv in firefly you were actually in space
you’re not one of those guys who really believe that are you
you mean one of the hopeless geeks no those are crazy people howard be a dear and get me another one of these now him he’s one of those geeks
all right now before you enter my bedroom unescorted i need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement easement it’s a legal right
do you believe him normally around women he has the personality of a boiled potato put one beer in him and he’s m night charmalarmalon
is that what he’s drinking it’s not even real beer
i don’t know some sort of placebo effect i guess
yes i’m still here where am i going i’m on a train now what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite hoberman’s sphere it’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron no the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock
actually in india the names of constellations are different where you have the big dipper we have the big curry pot
you got me now what are you going to do with me
hi i’m the small package good things come in
okay i got a box but there’s no key in here just letters
that’s the wrong box put it back
oh sheldon are these letters from your grandmother
oh look she calls you moon pie that is so cute
hey leonard how’s the train ride
delightful listen i don’t know what you’re doing right now but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of sheldon’s mouth
okay yeah i kind of crossed a line put him back on
nobody calls me moon pie but meemaw
so anyway in the dream you and i were ice skating just the two of us and then i picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off i tried to stick them back on but before i could you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread what do you think that means
i’ll give you a little clue my favourite sandwich salami on pumpernickel
and did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the german words pumper and nickel which loosely translates to fart goblin
okay i found the box now what
you’re holding a japanese puzzle box which takes ten precise moves to open first locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left then on the opposite end of the box slide the entire panel down two millimetres you’ll hear a slight click
hang on sheldon do you have any emotional attachment to this box
no it’s a novelty i ordered off the internet now did you hear the click
not yet puts box on ground and stomps on itthere it is
okay here’s another one if you married the famous rock guitarist johnny winter you’d be summer winter
okay i’m going to just go for broke here and say i like you
so here’s my question do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where i could ask you out and you’d say yes
fair enough i’ll leave you in peace
but before i go would you mind if i just take one picture of us together for my facebook page
okay great now can i take one where it looks like we’re making out
okay now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the usb port she calls me moon pie because i’m nummynummy and she could just eat me up now please put the flash drive in the usb port the one that looks like a little duck’s mouth
excuse me goes down to summer okay i’ll be honest with you i’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head trying to come up with some clever line to say to you but then i finally realized you’re a human being i’m a human being i could just say to you…
so i’m thinking you won the nobel prize what three years ago so you must deal with a whole lot of what has smoot done lately my thought is we continue my research as a team you know coopersmoot alphabetical and when we win the nobel prize you’ll be back on top
fine smootcooper wow what a diva
oh very nice what’s leonard going to do does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position
go leonard sprays an aerosol which lights up laser beams he tries to negotiate the beams as howard and raj sing dramatic music eventually he touches one of the beams and a buzzer sounds
too bad you know the rules of secret agent laser obstacle chess uh leonard died again sheldon you’re up
despite my deep love of chess lasers and aerosol disinfectant i must forfeit
– because it’s almost eleven o’clock
so penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or i punch you in the throat rule
hey you know what’d be a great idea we get some girls over here and play laser obstacle strip chess
believe me howard any girl who would be willing to play that you don’t want to see naked
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
this package came while you were at work
oh great my rhinestones thank you
when i signed for the package i was deputized by the united parcel service and entrusted with its final delivery i now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that i’m fully indemnified and no longer liable
sheldon it’s just a box of rhinestones
well the contents are irrelevant a legal bailment has been created does that mean nothing to you
it means nothing to anybody come here let me show you what i’m doing
bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property or chattels is transferred from one person the bailor to another person the bailee
yeah yeah yeah yeah look look look i started a business
no i’m making flower barrettes see i call them penny blossoms i made one for myself then all the girls at work wanted one then i showed some to this lady who runs a shop in old town she sells cards and homemade jewellery she said she wanted to sell them i said okay and in one week i made a 156
sheldon don’t you get it if this takes off i won’t have to be a waitress anymore
but then who will bring me my cheeseburger on tuesday nights
and you’re going to let her handle my food
i think you’re just making that up
sheldon i’m sorry about your hamburger okay i just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life
maybe i’d be better off with nancy
so what do you think i mean this could be a business right
how many of these can you make a day
and how much profit do you make per penny blossom
i don’t know like 50 cents i’m not sure
no of course you’re not all right ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars
well i don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff
i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree but if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques and you optimized your manufacturing process you might be able to make this a viable business
and you know about that stuff
penny i’m a physicist i have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains
i have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe good luck
sheldon hold on could you maybe show me how to make more money with this
just to be clear here you’re asking for my assistance
and you understand that will involve me telling you what to do
and you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while i’m doing so
good let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong
no sorry wait please come back
all right 12 minutes and 17 seconds
that’s 49 penny blossoms per hour based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price you’ll effectively be paying yourself… 519 a day
there are children in a sneaker factory in indonesia who outearn you
want me to show my work
oh god no no just please tell me what to do about it
all right are you familiar with the development that resulted from honoré blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts the assembly line of course
okay you know what if i’m not allowed to be snide you’re not allowed to be condescending
that wasn’t a part of our original agreement and i do not agree to it now
all right fine how are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment
you’re thinking of the moving assembly line an understandable but not excusable mistake no the moving assembly line that was introduced by henry ford in 1908 that innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a lowunit cost for manufactured goods i guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your radiohead
let’s go we’re going to miss the coming attractions
i think i bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn
i assume you’re referring to the sea shanty it’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity
yeah it’s crazy but it totally works look we made this penny blossom in under three minutes
terrific but that kind of raises more questions than it answers
penny’s making hair accessories i’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process all right break’s over they start singing again
hold on what are you using as a bonding agent
you’re kidding any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job
it won’t work the flower’s too porous
what if we infused the bottom layer with siliconertv to provide a better mounting surface
good question what are you marketing and distribution channels
well there are the waitresses at my work and this cute little shop in old town
hush hush hush hush hush virtually nonexistent i’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey ecommerce system to start
why not eliminate the middle man we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her bedroom
she’d need some kind of industrial cooling system
of course but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process to start with she has a terrible problem with moistureinduced glitter clump
it’s a common stripper problem they dance they sweat they clump
are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate
actually i’m thinking about this one stripper named vega but sure calcium sulphate could work
let’s think out of the box for a moment how about a molecular sieve
i’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen
hey we could liberate some microporous charcoal from the chem lab
oh great raj why don’t you and howard go get the charcoal leonard why don’t you start working on some preliminary web site designs i’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process
well what’s wrong with my apartment
wait wait what am i going to do
uh hey it’s your business do whatever you want
oh okay cool i’m going to take a nap
i’m still tweaking things a little bit but this will give you the general idea of the web site so what do you guys think
uh pretty much any way i say that is going to hurt his feelings
not you i wasn’t asking you penny
uh well it’s a little juvenile i mean it kind of looks like the myspace page of a 13yearold girl
please dateline could use it to attract predators
penny this is your enterprise so it’s ultimately your decision but based on the quality of his work i’d strongly recommend that we let leonard go
what i want is irrelevant this is penny’s decision penny
excuse me but if i did such a bad job then why do we already have orders
uhhuh look mrs fiona fondell from huntsville alabama has ordered two
thank you penny blossoms these will be perfect to cover my bald spot aww that is so sweet
camouflaging bald spots that’s primarily a male concern perhaps we could expand our market
how are flower barrettes going to appeal to men
wait a minute wait a minute you want to make a hair barrette with bluetooth
penny everything is better with bluetooth
holy crap someone just ordered a thousand penny blossoms
get out who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones
the fifth annual east rutherford new jersey gay lesbian bisexual and transgender alliance luau
oh another market to expand into balding gay men
and i’ll bet lesbians love bluetooth
wait wait wait why does it say oneday rush since when do we offer a oneday rush
yeah but they don’t have to glue the books together how the hell are we going to make a thousand penny blossoms in one day
don’t yell at me i’m not manufacturing i’m just web design
okay well i’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order
excuse me but was this not your goal financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation my brilliance and innovation of course but still
i just don’t see how see can pull this off
okay that right there that equivocation and selfdoubt that is not the american spirit did davy crockett quit at the alamo did jim bowie
they didn’t quit they were massacred by like a gazillion angry mexicans
alright let me put it this way your gross receipts on this one order will be over 3000 for one night’s work
you know if i wanted to spend my saturday nights doing this i could have stayed in india
oh stop with the fake third world crap your father’s a gynaecologist and you had a house full of servants
we only had four servants and two of them were children
we have 128 assorted penny blossoms ready to ship
oh god we’re never gonna finish in time who made sheldon the boss anyway
i believe i’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor
penny the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management observe hey less talk more work
thank you you hear any union talk you let me know
someone’s in the kitchen with dinah…
someone’s in the kitchen i knowowowow
someone’s in the kitchen with dinah… sheldon sheldon nudges him
‘cause i sold my soul to the company store
honey do you want some coffee
come on but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time
i’m sorry coffee’s out of the question when i moved to california i promised my mother that i wouldn’t start doing drugs
sheldon we still have 380 of these things to make
i have complete faith that you will make them good night
yeah no but sheldon without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail
very well but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics you’re going to have to answer to my mother
look at planck’s constant people say it’s arbitrary it could not be less arbitrary if it varied even slightly life as we know it would not exist bam now now let’s reconsider the entire argument but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre no it is retreating from a from a possibility space bam this is a space where we are all essentially alice through the looking glass standing in front the red queen and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst bam of course in another universe let’s call it universe prime there’s another sheldon let’s call him sheldon prime…
we should have let him go to bed
i can’t believe we actually did it
i just want you guys to know i am really grateful for your help and for every dollar i make i’m going to give you 20 cents
i’ll print out the shipping label uhoh
we got an email from the east rutherford new jersey gay lesbian bisexual and transgender alliance they want another thousand penny blossoms
oneday rush i really need to take that off the web site
okay well guess we’d better get started
come on what about the living organism of the workforce and the american spirit and jiminy crockett at the alamo
davy crockett jiminy crockett was a cricket
yes yes i know that okay i’m tired i’ve had like 18 cups of coffee the point is if we all just pull together we can do this who’s with me
penny although you may find it hard to believe we do have lives
sorry my apologies to the gay community of east rutherford new jersey
zoom zoom zoom where’s the coffee
no problem i’ll be back before this banana hits the ground zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
yes he takes a slice of pizza
sorry guys but secret agent laser obstacle lunch is just stupid
okay it’s done look guys for the future i don’t mind killing the big spiders but you have to at least try with the little ones
penny please we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids
not bad it’s horrible i mean you hear stories about this sort of thing but you never think it’ll happen to you
so they steamed your dumplings get over it new topic please
all right penny let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today
not with a thousand condoms howard
okay new topic please hey did you hear the people upstairs in 5a are moving out
the people upstairs are moving out
why would you just say something like that
no no no no no no no…
how else was i supposed to say it
slowly like putting a new fish in a tank you don’t just drop it in you let the bag sit in the water a while
sheldon i’m sure it’s going to be fine
no it’s not going to be fine change is never fine they say it is but it’s not
okay honey did you even know the people that are moving out
i never met them that’s what made them perfect there were no awkward hellos in the halls there was no clicketyclacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell
well i’m sure the new people will be just as quiet
you can’t know that how can you possibly know that
you’re right i can’t you know what anyone could rent that apartment now an opera singer the cast of stomp yeah a tapdancing pirate with a wooden leg
why are you making it worse
i tried making it better he wouldn’t go for it
you’re right that’s a great idea
i’ll take the apartment upstairs i can finally get away from my mother and we can all spend some more time together if you catch my drift
hold on you honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping wolowitz move and then he only need buy us a pizza
i’m sorry that really is how it works
you’re tricking me you tell me the truth what do we get
you get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps3
i knew it ps3 definitely  ps3 who would pick a mountain bike
enough with the guilt ma we’ll still see each other i’ll come over every night and have dinner with you
the hell you will what am i running here a fancy restaurant does this look like olive garden
okay i get it you’re angry you don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest
little bird you’re almost 30 fly for god’s sake
fine i’ll stay you happy crazy lady i sure as hell hope so because you’re ruining my life
hey penny it’s leonard good news you can take your head out of the oven
i guess i won’t be needing this
oh no the new ones they’re here
stay calm we don’t know anything about them yet what are you doing
i’m checking for musical instruments does that sound like castanets to you
so do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box
that is so great oh i’m leonard i live downstairs upstairs from here but under you not under you per se but under your apartment
if that concludes your faltering attempt to mate hello
hello on a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not catlike at all and ten being freakishly feline
is that your answer or do you not understand the question we’ll come back to that one
hang on are you now or have you ever been a salsa irish folk or breakdancer
oh i’m sorry well if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far next question are you fertile
i’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility
if that changes let me know and finally area rugs pro or con
thanks so much for helping me leonard
thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help
hey penny this is alicia our new neighbour
alicia’s nonmusical childless and prorug she’s still on probation of course but i like her
oh yeah i don’t usually dress like this i’m going jogging
true but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again
please you look cute i’m dressed like a slob today too
see ya i’m dressed like a slob today too
oh mimicry i enjoy mimicry i’ve been working on admiral ackbar from return of the jedi “it’s a trap” you have to imagine me with a giant squid head “it’s a trap it’s a trap it’s a trap”
congratulations i see you did your laundry
i bought new clothes okay is leonard around
oh all right that’s cool no biggie he said he’d help me set up my printer but i guess i can wait what exactly is he doing up there
in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me he is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo
oh they’re all up there huh hmm typical
it’s axiomatically atypical up until recently they did not know alicia and had no encounters with her in a previous location they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants so your characterization of their behaviour as typical is demonstrably fallacious
okay now i see the giant squid head leaves
oh great now i have to start all over again rubs out imaginary workings
yeah i thought about renting this apartment but i’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy
cool so are you in a loft now
oh actually i’m uh living with a woman in altadena purely platonic she’s also my maid
i won’t lie it’s pretty dope
hey i just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift
that is so sweet come on in let’s open it
oh this i’m dressed like a slob today
the guys have been helping me set up my sound system i’ve never had such goodlooking technical support
oh pishposh raj whispers to him i don’t know it means shucks raj whispers again shucks means shucks let one go once in a while
hey uh penny you want to hear something awesome
alicia is an actress just like you
well trying to be but it’s so hard
yeah i know tell me about it
i’ve been out here three months and all i’ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap
that’s why i work at the cheesecake factory i’m holding out for the right part
alicia what do you want as your default setting for dvds 51 dolby or dts
whatever you think is best cutie
well dts has more low end so… okay
uh hey guys guys you will really appreciate this i read the best science joke on the internet alicia you won’t get it but it’s right up their alley anyway so this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him this goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing the man says “well i’m a physicist and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me” the owner then says “well lots of single beautiful women come in here every day why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them and they might fall in love with you” and the physicist says “yeah but what are the odds of that happening”
it’s a little insulting don’t you think
how would i know i’m not even sure i get it
hey leonard if you’re done with the dvd player can you set up my printer
uh hey maybe when you’re done with her printer you could set up mine you know like you promised a week ago
yeah i’ll get to it don’t nag me
who is it oh hello penny it’s open come in sarcasm
well they’re all still up there
you think i can’t hear them listen to that stomp stomp stomp that’s wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one
i don’t even know why i care i don’t care all right i cared enough to memorize that stupid joke but that’s all i care
you know penny there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting occasionally a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power when this happens the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains
what are you saying that i’m threatened by alicia that i’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go
i’m just talking about bees they’re on the discovery channel what are you talking about
bees aaah i just got that physicist joke
gee penny thanks for buying us dinner
no no occasion just felt like getting some chinese chow for my peeps
did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded
even though the menu description specifies shredded
you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard
did you pick up the lowsodium soy sauce from the market
good see how it’s done leonard
so what do we got going on tonight huh playing halo watching battlestar drop some mentos in diet coke
what can i say i got my geek on boys
no no pms is different there is a knock on the door leonard answers it
oh thank god you’re home i need help
i just got a callback to audition for csi to play a hooker who gets killed
but my car is in the shop and i have to be at universal in fortyfive minutes
i’ll run lines with you in the car
great and afterward i’ll take you all out for chinese
oh actually that’s okay we already have…
they’re gone penny they can’t hear you
i cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that i mean anything she wants they go panting after her like trained dogs you know that just last week she had howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in orange county to pick up her tv
you once had leonard and me get your television from your exboyfriend
apples and oranges here sheldon i’m telling you that girl is a user iceskating through the life on her looks taking advantage of innocent weakwilled men getting auditions for stupid network shows it creams my corn
guess what i got the part on csi
uh no no no no you know congratulations i think you’ll make a great hooker
thank you hey i got to ask you something how much do physicists make
um i don’t know i don’t think a lot
yeah that’s what i figured well got to run the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom yay
um hey hey can i talk to you about that for a second
well you know it’s just that leonard and howard and raj they aren’t like other guys they’re special
oh let’s see how can i explain this um they don’t know how to use their shields
yeah you know like in star trek when you’re in battle and you raise the shields where the hell did that come from anyways um you know how guys like this are so please don’t take advantage of them
who says i’m taking advantage of them
come on they’re doing everything for you because you’re leading them on
so i let them do stuff for me they’re happy i get stuff who cares and how’s it any different from what you do
i’ve seen you around them are you pretending like you don’t do the exact same thing
okay lady you are way out of line
well what are you going to do about it bitch
i like green lantern i’m just saying it’s pretty lame that he can be defeated by the colour yellow
only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow
golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood
great so i can take them both out with a numbertwo pencil
oh my god girl fight he grabs leonard
i know you you’re stupid enough to break it up
may i say you look very comely tonight
you’re right this filly’s been broken
you set it on dts didn’t you
i had to she called me cutie
according to alicia’s facebook page she’s hooking up with one of the producers on csi
well dead whore on tv live one in real life
oh great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed
we don’t have thai food on thursday we have pizza on thursday
yes but we all agreed that the third thursday of every month would be anything can happen thursday
well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system which when startled has its own version of anything can happen thursday
come on the whole idea behind anything can happen thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately
rut i think you mean consistency and if we’re going to abandon that then why even call it thursday let’s call it quonko day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god ra
i could go for some goat
sheldon we agreed we’d do something different tonight
all right let’s go to the comic book store
we went to the comic book store last night
last night was wednesday wednesday is comic book night tonight we’ll be going on thursday because it’s anything can happen thursday
way to think outside but pressed right up against the box sheldon
so what are we going to do tonight
if i may proffer a suggestion in bars all across this great nation of ours thursday night is ladies’ night which means as the evening progresses we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and twoforone jello shots
come on howard the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero
really are you familiar with the drake equation
the one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets and those planets likely to develop life n equals r times fp times ne times fl times fi times fc times l
yeah that one you can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in los angeles the number of those who might find us attractive and what i call the wolowitz coefficient
neediness times dress size squared crunching the numbers i come up with a conservative 5812 potential sex partners within a 40mile radius
i’m a horny engineer leonard i never joke about math or sex
well what are we waiting for let’s bounce bitches
you’re right it’s anything can happen thursday let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women
here we go lock up your daughters we’re going to hit it and quit it
or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store
alright but next anything can happen thursday we’re definitely going to a bar
you heard that ladies’ night ladies we’re eventually coming for you
oh hey guys where’re you headed
to the comic book store you’re probably thinking the comic book store on a thursday why i’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness what you have failed to take into account penny is that this is anything can happen thursday
you got me while you’re there could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday
i think you mean comic books comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages
leonard could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday
i don’t know he’s 13 just pick out anything
just pick out anything maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows
amazing spiderman ultimate spiderman spectacular spiderman the marvelous adventures of spiderman spiderman 2099
you know this can go on all night why don’t you just come with us
ugh that’s what i was trying to avoid
oh what a cute little store everybody’s staring at me
don’t worry they’re more scared of you than you are of them
unlikely here what about this one for my nephew
yeah provided he has already read infinite crisis and 52 and is familiar with the reestablishment of the dc multiverse
come on i’ll help you pick something
that’s right she’s with us guys like that are so pathetic
tell me about it look a new batman belt buckle
oh hey stuart this is penny she’s looking for some comic books
oh really blink twice if you’re here against your will
let me know if you need anything
thanks he seems like a nice guy
you mean for someone who’s into comic books
no no no i just meant for… yeah
penny just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos stuart’s a terrific artist he went to the rhode island school of design
what about the guy over there in the superhero tshirt tucked into his sweatpants
ah yeah that’s captain sweatpants he doesn’t really help the point i’m trying to make
why should i let it go i saw it first
yes but i saw it from the front
oh come on i need this for my batman collection
i need it for my robin collection
why would i gamble it’s mine let go
yes he won’t let go of my comic book
hi what would you recommend as a present for a 13yearold boy
a 13yearold girl but if you’re dead set on a comic book try this
a morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead
well if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt i don’t know what will is this me
that’s so sweet but what if i didn’t like it
it’d still be you but i’d feel like an idiot
i don’t believe it stuart’s putting the moves on penny
i have got to learn how to draw hey
once again defeated by your own prurient interests
guys have you seen stuart all up in penny’s business over there
nobody’s up in anybody’s business let’s just buy our stuff and go
okay you’ve got my number now give me the picture
you drive a hard bargain but here
all right so um just give me a call
so leonard how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday
look at that that’s a dent thank you howard hamfisted wolowitz did you just shut the tv off in the middle of the classic deep space ninestar trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode
all right then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening
when did you pick up on that
a moment ago when you turned off the tv in the middle of during the classic deep space ninestar trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode would you like some advice
then this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section
would you rather i offer my personal insight
i don’t need any insights i just want to know why penny’s more interested in stuart than me we’re practically the same guy
oh i disagree stuart is taller artistic selfemployed and most significantly he gets 45 percent off comic books
you’re right i really should be asking strangers on the internet
chinese food vintage video games after the nightmare of anything can happen thursday this is friday night the way it was meant to be
hey penny… and stuart hey stuart
so what are you kids up to
uh stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight
and you guys are going together great…
it is great really great freaking awesome what are you guys doing
it’s friday night that means chinese food and vintage video games right
vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned tonight we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure zork it’s the buggy beta version
wow zork well you guys have fun
take me to a bar with women
okay let me just go inside and slip off my underwear
well if i get lucky i don’t want to be caught in my aquaman briefs
do you… raj checks his underwear let’s go
may i have a grasshopper with a little umbrella please
i’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella
fine i’ll have a chocolate martini
come on you know i can’t talk to women unless i’m lit up like the hindu festival of diwali
look there are plenty of bars in los angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them
gotcha i’ll have a brandy alexander
all right the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo
should we talk to some of these women
it’s way too early in the night for that see first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame
that’s my system oh and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog she’s mine
oh come on i think it’s nice that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening
yeah it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all the cheese
um you know it’s kind of early do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something
oh gee it’s a little late for coffee isn’t it
oh you think coffee means coffee that is so sweet come on i think i have decaf
oh good stuart i thought i heard your voice do you have a moment
sheldon we’re a little busy here so…
isn’t it a little late for coffee
it’s okay she thinks she has decaf
i’ll just go look for it
well i’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the dc comics batman chatroom and i need your help
oh yeah those guys can be very stubborn what’s the topic
i am asserting in the event that batman’s death proves permanent that original robin dick grayson is the logical successor to the bat cowl
ooh sheldon i’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong
more wrong wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation
of course it is it’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge but returning to the original issue dick grayson became nightwing a superhero in his own right batman 2 has to be the second robin jason todd
has to be has to be i hope you’re being deliberately provocative
yeah herbal tea for me please
nah they’re eating peanuts and my allergies one kiss would put me in cedarsinai for a week
what about the ones in the corner
possible very possible do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking
wait so we just go over there
no we have a little prep work to do put this in your mouth we walk past them you stumble a bit i say sorry my friend’s had a little too much and then i start to pull it out of your mouth and say a little too much fun get it i mean they’re laughing we’re laughing and then we get them up to about a 15 blood alcohol level and tell them we’re millionaires
depends are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy
i can’t sit on your lap you don’t know the routine
i’m sorry but you’re obviously stuck in a prezero hour dc universe
of course i am removing joe chill as the killer of batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être
okay you can throw all the french around you want it doesn’t make you right
plus you’re forgetting that the infinite crisis storyline restored joe chill to the batman mythology
i am forgetting nothing and i resent your tone
okay look sheldon it’s late and i’ve got to get some sleep
penny i really had a terrific time penny
no no no no don’t wake her she’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine
you know i don’t think that was decaf
wait is this your card or isn’t it trust me this was their card
i thought you were good at this you’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women
well what happened we’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called
wow you’re just going to make me come out and say it aren’t you
you’re weighing me down i’m a falcon who hunts better solo
fine i’ll sit here you take flight and hunt
don’t be ridiculous you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt
actually you can there’s a whole sport built around it falconry
shut up let’s just get koothrappali and go they turn to see raj with his tongue down the throat of a “larger lady” by the bar lucky bastard it’s got to be that stupid accent of his to a girl nearby hello i am sanjay wolowitz from bombay okay i’m stumped
okay are you from star wars universe
were you in the original trilogy
is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini
god i hope not and no i’m not princess leia
oh okay okay my turn are you in the six star wars movies
do you kind of look like a shiny sheldon
that’s preposterous i do not resemble c3po don’t get me wrong i’m flattered i just don’t see it
leslie winkle you’ve reached friends with benefits for a booty call press one now
what exactly does that expression mean friends with benefits does he provide her with health insurance
no look imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with but you were free to date whoever you wanted
i’m sorry i can’t imagine any of that
i believe it’s my turn you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready
aren’t you leaving for your booty call
no it was something else why does everything have to be about sex with you come on who’s turn is it
okay let’s see are you from a tv series
i bet he’s someone from babylon 5 we’re never going to guess
what happened with leslie why did she dump you
i don’t know she just said howard momma’s a rolling stone and then her call waiting beeped and she was gone
i don’t understand if you were in a nonemotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response
sheldon he obviously had feelings for her
of course i had feelings for her i saw her naked for god’s sake
okay uh look you just need to get your mind off it do you want to go to the comic book store maybe go see a movie
i don’t want to go anywhere
you know i’m given to understand that there is an entire city in nevada designed specifically to help people like howard forget their problems where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases
is it me or was that sheldon’s way of saying vegas baby
i’ve never been there have you
me no i just got vegas baby from vince vaughn in swingers 
it could be fun i know my weekend’s wide open now that…
okay then let’s do this lets go to las vegas
why not people do things right now all the time why can’t we be right now people too go home pack a bag and we’ll be right now people i have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription but after that we’ll go right now
what are you going to tell your mother
i’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal
great we’ll bring you back a teeshirt
and how are you doing this fine evening
i’m just in a good mood while my compatriots are in las vegas i will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal fortress of solitude
that’s superman’s big ice thing right
do you know i’m such a good mood i’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the english language folksy and charming today
that is the intoxicating aroma of kadhai paneer a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds not only is it indian cuisine which koothrappali loathes it contains a generous helping of peanuts which would reduce wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister and finally it’s main ingredient is paneer a farmer’s cheese which would cause leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes
yum well enjoy your big evening
penny i realize you are also on your own tonight so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do please do not disturb me
oh i shall sings superman theme while searching his pockets no
what’s wrong superman locked out of your big ice thingy
look at this mouthwash lotion body wash shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle i love las vegas
howard could i borrow some after shave
that is a lot of cologne
first row are your musks second is wood leathers and botanicals third is assorted pheromones tread lightly
that’s the spirit howard yes we can
you guys go ahead i just have to finish up an email
that’s not an email that’s leslie’s facebook page
okay fine i’m checking her facebook page look at her status update she’s saying she dumped me people need to know i dumped her
grow up rajthere’s no place for truth on the internet just go i’ll catch up with you
oh we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky
okay uh if i get lucky i’ll take her to my stately manor outside gotham city and if you get lucky i’ll sleep on the moon
hang on i think the emergency key is around here somewhere
we have a bowl our keys go in a bowl you should get a bowl
so how did the beautiful mind of sheldon cooper forget his key in the first place
i left them in the bowl
ohoh i just remembered where the emergency key is
what’s it doing in my apartment
well i went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home and i forgot it there
you were in my… why would you… what are you saying
it’s not a big deal i was making coffee and i ran out of milk
you’re the milk thief leonard said i was crazy but i knew that carton felt lighter
alright sheldon let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager he’ll come open your door you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting
eat my dinner in your apartment
sure why not and after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pickup and go skinnydipping down at the creek ‘cause today’s the day to stop making sense
i’m telling you leonard video slot machines free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for 395 disneyland can suck it this is the real happiest place on earth
dude check it out that’s laundry for a month
hello rajesh ram… hi rajesh i’m michaela
so are you interested a little party
why yes i love to party party is my middle name or it would be if it weren’t ramayan
uh raj can i can i talk to you for a moment
not now leonard michaela’s inviting me to a party you better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you
yeah i really need to talk to you
excuse me i’ll be right back don’t go anywhere don’t move just stay the beautiful unspoiled american flower that you are to leonard what’s wrong with you dude that woman was all up in my jammy
okay i hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is but i’m pretty sure she is a prostitute
okay let me put it this way in your entire life how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party
maybe but i’m guessing it will cost you about 500 an hour to try
it was lovely meeting you best of luck in your future endeavours
oh howard’s losing it check out his latest twitters “i’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss my life is meaningless my future is without hope”
why don’t we take him to see the blue man group
usa today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family
i don’t know howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy
it’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker she’s exactly his type a hooker you know i bet if we hired her that would cheer him up
we’re not going to get wolowitz a hooker
“i’m so lonely and horny i may open this 20 jar of peanuts and end it all”
suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate
are you trying to make small talk oh sweetie you really don’t have to
no it’s the accepted convention how was your day
well uh they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…
i’m sorry that’s not going to interest me at all just eat
yeah hi listen m if you’re not busy well wwe were thinking you could… well we were wondering…
okay great um… uh the thing is we’ve got this friend and he’s kind of down in the dumps and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up
i think she knows what i meant
how can she when you beat around the bush she’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real
don’t worry i can take good care of your friend
okay terrific um uh listen is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…
yes yeah exactly the girlfriend experience
uh actually if it’s not too much to ask could we have the jewish girlfriend experience
okay that’s question 20 you have to guess
oh god i don’t know sheldon are you star wars
how can one person be a whole movie
okay i give up can we just do something else
fine i was spock are you and leonard friends with benefits
are you and leonard friends with benefits
where did that even come from did he say we were
no leonard said nothing but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered
i’m curious about the whole social construct on its face the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite assuming one is afflicted with such without emotional entanglement that seems eminently practical what i’ve observed however is howard wolowitz crying like a little girl
well some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship
are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment
sheldon i really don’t want to talk about this with you
is this conversation making you uncomfortable
of course it’s making me uncomfortable can’t you tell
i really have no idea i don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions body language…
alright where are these amazing shrimp
seriously you think this is the size of a baby’s arm
i’m going back to the room
boy would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket
i don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so here
are you suggesting i sleep on the couch
well it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind but it’s the one i’m going with
i can’t sleep on your couch i sleep in a bed and given it’s dimensions i have no intention of living out em snickering’s beloved children’s book  the tall man from cornwall
there was a tall man from cornwall whose length exceeded his bed my body fits on it but barely upon it there’s no room for my big cornish head
oh alright i will give you my bed on one condition that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours
may i say one last thing
turn ons let me see reading a good book in front of the fire long walks on the beach getting freaky on the sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger
yeah excuse me for a moment
cut the crap you set this up didn’t you
you already gave her the money
i can’t sleep how are you going
maybe that’s because your hole is still open
your home is twenty feet from here
twenty feet twenty light years it doesn’t matter it’s in a galaxy far far away
damn it what do you want me to do
that’s only for when you’re sick
homesick is a type of being sick
come on do i really have to
i suppose we can stay up and talk
soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty um…
soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr
thank you for letting me stay here
okay i’m sleepy now get out
what were you doing at penny’s
well we had dinner uh played some games and then i spent the night oh you’ll be happy to know that i now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits
smell that that’s the smell of new comic books oh yes
you’re paying have you been selling your sperm again
no i’m celebrating as we speak the space shuttle is docking at the international space station where it will deploy the wolowitz zerogravity waste disposal system
oh get over yourself it’s a hightech toilet
just think thanks to your hard work an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
is that supposed to be funny
i believe it is the combination of the star trek reference and the play on words involving the doublemeaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing
okay make your little jokes but of the four of us i’m the only one making any realworld contribution to science and technology
he’s right this is an important achievement for two reasons number one and of course number two
oh clever playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions
here sheldon i pulled the new hellboy for you it’s mindblowing
you told me it’s mindblowing so my mind is going into it preblown and once a mind is preblown it cannot be reblown
uh hey leonard can i talk to you about something
remember i went out with your friend penny a couple weeks ago
sure you remember you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women
well uh the thing is the date didn’t go that well
oh too bad i guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up dust yourself off forget it and move on
‘cause we’re going out again tomorrow
excuse me stuart have you read the new flash
well i have and it will knock your socks off good luck getting them back on
uh anyway i figured this is probably my last shot with penny and i don’t want to screw it up
so here’s my question it’s the second date you think she’ll be expecting things to get physical
uh oh gee my initial reaction is no you know let me think about it and get back to you okay
okay so you’ll give me a call
interesting penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor
you know thanks for closedcaptioning my pain raj
hey wanna make sure he gets nowhere with penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them
just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years
fine oh hey can i ask you something
well he asked me out again and i said yes and then i started thinking maybe i should talk to you first
well does it bother you me going out with one of your friends ‘cause you know you and me…
no no that’s the past i’m really more of a right now kind of guy you know living in the moment although i do have to live a little in the future ’cause well that’s my job of course my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards but those stories often take place in the future in conclusion no it doesn’t bother me
okay well that’s really cool of you
yeah well i wouldn’t say cool i’d just say that’s leonard
well in that case do you mind giving me some advice
he’s very shy how do i make him feel more comfortable around me
well uh first of all don’t underestimate the value of discomfort
well yeah stuart thrives under pressure that’s why he works in a comic book store
you’re not going to answer it
he wants to talk about penny i don’t want to talk about penny
you’re making an assumption perhaps the comic book store is on fire and he needs your assistance
we don’t know and if you don’t answer the phone we can’t know
i’m not answering the phone sheldon
no there it went to voice mail
aren’t you going to check your messages
you have to check your messages the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message if that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy
it must be hell inside your head
guys we have a code red
do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert code red the computer worm or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of mountain dew
look i was going over the schematics on my zerog toilet and i made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve
it’s gonna fail after about ten flushes
but the mission is for six months
yeah see that’s the code red it’s kind of like a jackinthebox no one knows exactly when but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box
no are you crazywhat am i gonna say i screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station
well what are you gonna do
i’m gonna figure out how to fix it then i’ll tell them
so what do you need us for
he can’t figure out how to fix it
hey you said you were gonna be supportive
i’m trying but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny
i agree it’s the juxtaposition of the hightech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here check your messages
all right this is an exact duplicate of the wolowitz zerogravity human waste disposal system as deployed on the international space station
don’t you mean the wolowitz zerogravity human waste distribution system
yeah ha it’s hilarious now here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station we gotta find a way using nothing but this to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine
you mean so it doesn’t hit the fan
yeah i have to say i thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop there is a knock on the door
yeah it’s a regular manhattan project what’s up
well tonight’s my date with penny and since we haven’t been able to connect by phone…
yeah i’m sorry it’s been broken
anyway i was just wondering if you had any lastminute advice
all right well off the top of my head i think the most important thing with penny is to go really slow i mean glacial
you know guys come onto her all the time so you need to like set yourself apart you know be a little shy don’t make too much eye contact and you know treat her with like cool detachment and and and you know fear
yeah like you’re afraid that if you touch her she’ll break
well that plays right into my wheelhouse
good good well you kids have fun tonight
thanks leonard what is that thing anyway
you don’t know what this is
be afraid of penny nice very crafty
it wasn’t bad advice it just wasn’t particularly helpful
for what it’s worth my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain we make jesus cry
all right what if we use this twoinch pvc to reinforce the centre crosssupport
no good i mean it might work for the japanese and the americans but have you seen the size of the russians they got up there this thing has to hold up against a hearty potatobased diet
maybe if you were helping you’d feel better about yourself
i deliberately tried to sabotage stuart’s date with penny
of course you feel terrible you completely screwed up your karma dude
you don’t really believe in that superstition do you
it’s not superstition it’s practically newtonian for every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a twofaced bitch therefore he is reborn as a banana slug it’s actually a very elegant system you know what goes around comes around
speaking of what goes around comes around…
okay look instead of trying to reinforce this structure here what if we just ran another line bypass it entirely
it won’t work the diameter of the tubing is insufficient
what if we reposition the collection tank
it won’t work no way to mount it
okay here’s an idea what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband avi in israel
nothing we just pulled an allnighter trying to fix a zerogravity… pasta maker i’m gonna make a coffee run do you want any
oh no thanks i have coffee
great so how’d it go with stuart last night
i really don’t want to talk about it
yeah right sure the thing is before you guys went out i spoke to him and…
i said i don’t want to talk about it
okay… i just… i kind of…
look leonard what goes on between me and stuart is none of your business so just leave it alone okay
if you really want to clean up your karma go get my freakin’ latte
hang on i think i’ve got this help me see if we can wedge this little piece of pvc behind the support rod
you’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building
sheldon i know what i’m doing
if you knew what you were doing there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be
howard wait why don’t you use this instead of the pvc to keep the transverse filter assembly in place
because this is not a spare part from the space station this is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese
that what that’s for in india the lid just touches the cheese of course we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie
oh an excellent idea i could certainly use a break
hold on you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space
why does leonard get to go
‘cause he’s upset over his situation with penny and if i have to hear about it again i’m going to kick him in his ovaries
i got your back sister all right i think we’ve got a prototype ready to test hand me that tupperware
damn right it’s heavy it’s my mother’s meat loaf it’s been testing toilets for generations
i must say howard i think a detailed letter to mit describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree
okay simulated zerogravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three two one switches flush meatloaf hits ceiling
what do you think the problem is
hey stuart i need to talk to you
i think i gave you bad advice about penny and i want to apologize
you’re kidding never worked for me
yeah last night at dinner i did what you told me i went really slow i kept my distance and two bottles of wine later we were making out in my car
wine i didn’t say to give her wine
it doesn’t matter that’s where it all went to hell
during the kissing what did you do sneeze in her mouth i did that to a girl once
no everything was good and really hot and i said “oh penny” and right where she was supposed to say “oh stuart” she said… your name
yeah no yeah wow i’m sorry that must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear
well it beats you know i’m a dude right yeah it was pretty bad
no doubt no doubt okay well i’m sorry it didn’t work out
yeah how about that see you soon
yes sir i understand classified we’ll keep it all classified no one has to know but you and me
howard’s space toilet i’ll tell you later
well they’ve deployed our solution let’s just all hope it works
i don’t see why i have to worry my career’s not hanging in the balance that was a joke it’s funny because it’s true
leonard could you pass the soy sauce please
i’m sorry were you talking to me
what was it doing on the ceiling
houston international space station we have a little situation up here we’d like to make an unscheduled space walk
i can’t comment without violating our agreement that i don’t criticize your work
there’s nothing wrong with the science here
perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science
you actually had it right in the first place once again you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks bazinga well now here’s a peculiar email the president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 am
it doesn’t say it must be an emergency everyone at the university knows i eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8
yes how did we live before twitter i guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning
that’s 14 hours away for the next 840 minutes i’m effectively one of heisenberg’s particles i know where i am or i know how fast i’m going but i can’t know both yet how am i supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
sheldon it’s two o’clock in the morning
why is everybody keep telling me what time it is
you the president of the university his wife their sullen teenage daughter that entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it
you went to president seibert’s house in the middle of the night
he didn’t respond to my email his phone number is unlisted tell me what my other option was
you could have waited until morning i know look who i’m talking to
do you remember the grant proposal i submitted to the national science foundation to detect slowmoving monopoles at the magnetic north pole
hardly a day goes by when i don’t think about it
aw how nice well a space opened up at the last minute on the nsf expedition to the arctic circle
wait a minute he offered to send you to the north pole
yes in fact he was quite enthusiastic he said “frankly if i could send you tonight i would”
okay well do you want to go
of course not i’m a theoretical physicist a career i chose in no small part because it’s indoors but if i’m able to detect slowmoving magnetic monopoles there i will be the scientist to confirm string theory people will write books about me thirdgraders will create macaroniart dioramas depicting scenes from my life
sure maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death
i’m on the horns of a dilemma can you imagine me sheldon cooper at the north pole
easy peasy i’m doing it right now
i’m not good with cold leonard how often have we had to leave a movie theatre because i got a headache from drinking the icee too fast i can’t go
how can you say that the scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go
listen to you how can i possibly go
sheldon what are the words i can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep
odd president seibert posed the exact same question
it wasn’t his wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot
just imagine if he says yes we’ll have an entire summer without sheldon
we could sit on the left side of the couch
i could use the bathroom at 8
our dreams are very small aren’t they
good news gentlemen i have tentatively accepted…
…the invitation to join the arctic expedition
it’s not gonna be the same without you
thank you but your sentiments may be premature
ooh i don’t like where this is going
i would like to propose that the three of you accompany me
is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away
i’ll admit that was a concern but the fact is i’ll need a support team and the three of you are my first choice
well there are others who might be more qualified but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache now i know i’m proposing an enormous undertaking so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it
we’re not really gonna go to the north pole with him are we
i’m still within earshot you may want to wait for my door to close
we’re not really gonna go to the north pole with him are we
hang on let’s talk about it this is a national science foundation expedition i don’t know how we can turn it down
easy instead of saying no we don’t want to go on an nsf expedition say no we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the arctic circle with an anal nutbag”
but if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program
howard this is big science you could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines
i could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills sheldon
you still might get on a magazine
so you guys are seriously considering this
and you think you can put up with sheldon
well i’m a hindu my religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next three months at the north pole with sheldon and i’m reborn as a wellhung billionaire with wings
well gentlemen have you reached a decision
oh damn it peer pressure fine
excellent and just an fyi as i am the expedition’s team leader protocol dictates that be phrased fine sir but don’t worry there will be a briefing
i need access to the cheesecake factory’s walkin freezer
now honey i already told you the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature
no this is to train for a threemonth expedition to the magnetic north pole
i don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you but to elaborate i’m going to the arctic circle with leonard wolowitz and koothrappali
is that a yes or a no on the freezer the woman has the attention span of a gnat
sheldon says you’re going to the north pole
yeah i’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me
oh well it all happened kind of fast and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on you know snow and stuff sorry i was gonna tell you
oh hey no you don’t have to apologize there’s no reason you have to tell me i was just you know surprised
yes yes you were busy you were surprised all very fascinating now where do we stand on the freezer
all right i’ll see what i can do so three months at the north pole wow that is awesome
i’m sorry but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action
just a warning sheldon the freezer locks from the outside
did she seem upset to you
no did she seem upset to you
oh good i got it right are you upset
two for two i’m on fire
i mean i know she’s not my girlfriend or anything but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that i’m going to be gone for the whole summer
that feels like a bonus question i’m going to stop here while i’m ahead but i’ve had a great time
alright now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the arctic circle
right here all right team open up your practice kits as the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the cheesecake factory because apparently i’m “ridiculous” i’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills leonard you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage casio model 1175 calculator watch i received when i won the earth science medal in 3rd grade treat it with respect raj you will be painting sideburns and a van dyke on a sixinch figurine of legolas the elf now remember a van dyke is a goatee without a moustache wolowitz you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game operation to begin with you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars
for this i went to mit
i think i swallowed some paint
i can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves oh son of a bitch
adversity is to be expected continue
oh boy am i gonna get sued
gentlemen use your imagination innovate did han solo let luke skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of hoth no he cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up
you heard the man hold him down and i’ll cut him open
hang on i know i don’t possess the tools of leadership but i don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside
i hadn’t thought of that i guess we’re done here
it’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter
because in the frigid temperatures in the arctic we need to consume at least 5000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight
sheldon you know i can’t eat butter i’m lactose intolerant
way ahead of you that’s an “i can’t believe it’s not butter” stick
but mummy all the other guys are going to the north pole
i don’t care what the other guys are doing if the other guys jumped in the bay of bengal and tried to swim to sri lanka would you follow them
if you were standing behind me nagging i might
don’t talk back to your mother this trip is much too dangerous rajesh
no it’s not howard tell them
doctor and mrs koothrappali namaste i understand your concern but if it’ll make you feel any better my mother is fine with me going and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until i was 17
so she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus
that’s very unlikely mrs koothrappali if raj dies it’ll be from frostbite gangrene acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear
ma i’m putting you on speakerphone with raj’s parents can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the arctic
arctic i thought you said arkansas
i didn’t say that you never listen to me
he doesn’t tell me anything he lives a secret life because he’s ashamed
hey leonard can i talk to you for a sec
sure but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt what’s up
well i got you a little going away present
oh no no no not just a blanket see it has sleeves yeah  so you can you know be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff
oh i’m gonna miss you she hugs him for a long time see you later
i told you no why don’t you believe me
‘cause it doesn’t make sense to me how can it be that in the entire country of india there isn’t one outback steakhouse
listen i don’t know if i can go on the expedition
i don’t think i can go to the north pole
okay leonard i know you’re concerned about disappointing me but i want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low
comforting is a part of leadership it’s not a part i care for but such is my burden
terrific it’s just that i don’t think penny wants me to go
assuming that’s a valid reason not to go which it isn’t how do you know this did she say it
not exactly but she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this
oh that’s clever let me see if i understand this correctly her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable
all right well given that missing you is predicated on you leaving logic dictates you must leave
yes okay but i’m gonna be gone for three months what if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else
she does have a short attention span
leonard you may be right it appears that penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion
of course not even in my sleepdeprived state i’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks bazinga
oh leonard what time is it
it’s 7 am i’m sorry it’s early but we’re leaving soon and i needed to talk to you
what did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me
um i don’t know you’ll be gone and i’ll notice
okay well um what about this what does this mean
wine credit card and late night television are a bad combination
all right fine what about that really long hug what did that mean
it was at least five mississippis a standard hug is two mississippis tops
leonard i don’t know what to tell you it was just a hug
okay bye penny closes door to herself means i wish you weren’t going
all right men we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours but until then you are all off duty i suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled
hey guys can i just say something how about we take a moment to think about where we are right now this is literally the top of the world only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see
so who’s up for a movie
good idea what do you think ice station zebra or john carpenter’s the thing
did you bring the dehydrated lowsodium soy sauce
not to worry i hid it bazinga you’re in my spot
there’s no time for a crossbow find me an icicle
three months this is gonna be great
i can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell
it was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening
i don’t know what arctic expedition you guys were on but i thought it was a hoot and a half
oh hi mom no i told you i’d call you when i got home i’m not home yet walks through door alright i’m home the arctic expedition was a remarkable success i’m all but certain there’s a nobel prize in my future actually i shouldn’t say that i’m entirely certain no mother i could not feel your church group praying for my safety the fact that i’m home safe is not proof that it worked that logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc no i’m not sassing you in eskimo talk
i’m going to go let penny know we’re back
mother i have to go yeah love you bye to his spot hello old friend sits daddy’s home
yeah i just stopped by to say… she grabs him and kisses him yeah so hi
hi they stumble kissing into her apartment and slam the door shut
dammit i should have gone over and told her we were back
yeah it was first come first served
i just want you both to know when i publish my findings i won’t forget your contributions
of course i can’t mention you in my nobel acceptance speech but when i get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy
you fellows are planning a party for me aren’t you
if there’s going to be a theme i should let you know that i don’t care for luau toga or under the sea
yeah we’ll keep that in mind look we need to talk to you about something that happened at the north pole
if this is about the night the heat went out there’s nothing to be embarrassed about
and we agreed to never speak of it again
so we slept together naked it was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting
for me it was a bonding moment
sheldon you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious giant dictator
i thought we were going to be gentle with him
that’s why i added the tator and then when we found our first positive data you were so happy
oh yes in the world of emoticons i was colon capital d
well in actuality what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigmshifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off
he just went colon capital o
it was the only way to keep you from being such a huge dickensian you see that i added the ensian
did leonard know about this leonard’s my best friend in the world surely leonard didn’t know
of course it was the whole plan reeks of leonard
i couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone
me neither except for one night when the heat went out long story it’s… don’t ask
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
whispering do not make a sound is a sound
damn his vulcan hearing not a good time sheldon
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
hello penny i realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you may i interrupt this one
it’s great to see you too come on in
wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception do you have anything to say for yourself
yes i feel terrible about it i will never forgive myself i don’t expect you to either and i would really appreciate it if you would leave me with penny for a session of selfcriticism and repentance
okay can someone please tell me what’s going on here
what’s going on is i was led to believe i was making groundbreaking strides in science when in fact i was being fed false data at the hands of wolowitz koothrappali and your furry little boy toy
it was the only way to make him happy
why did you have to make him happy
because when he wasn’t happy we wanted to kill him there was even a plan we were going to throw his kindle outside and when he went to get it lock the door and let him freeze to death
that seems like a bit of an overreaction
no the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush look we kept the original data you can still publish the actual results
yes but the actual results are unsuccessful and i’ve already sent an email to everyone at the university explaining that i have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe
aw see yeah you probably shouldn’t have done that so write another email set the record straight it’s no big deal
you’re right leonard it’s not a big deal all you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university that fyi was sarcasm i in fact believe it is a big deal
wait wait aren’t you going to go talk to him
what uh he’ll be fine the guy’s a trouper come here
no you’re right you shouldn’t talk to him i will
man i cannot catch a break
hey do you want to talk
about what being betrayed by my friends spending three months at the north pole for nothing and i didn’t even get to go to comiccon
oh hon… uh… singing  soft kitty warm kitty…
that’s for when i’m sick sad is not sick
oh sorry i don’t know your sad song
i don’t have a sad song i’m not a child
well you know i do understand what you’re going through
really did you just have the nobel prize in waitressing stolen from you
well no but when i was a senior in high school one of my friends heard i was going to be named head cheerleader oh i was so excited my mom even made me a celebration pie then they named stupid valerie mossbacher head cheerleader big ol’ slutbag
are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a nobel prize
and on a different but not unrelated topic based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader
look sheldon i just don’t think that the guys and leonard really meant to hurt you you know they just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation okay you know what it’s like remember that scene in the new star trek movie when kirk has to take over the ship so he tells spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true like saying spock didn’t care his mom died
i missed comiccon and the new star trek movie
thanks i call it the clooney
i call it the mario and luigi but whatever hey how’s sheldon doing
well he came out of his room this morning wearing his darth vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the force so i’d say a little better
if i may abruptly change the subject did you and penny finally… you know
personally i don’t care but my genitals wanted me to ask
well tell your genitals what i do with penny is none of their business
he says they didn’t do it
sheldon over here sheldon sits at another table and tries to choke all three to death with the force raj pretends he is choking
i feel bad for the guy
sheldon why are you sitting by yourself
because i am without friends like the proverbial cheese i stand alone even while seated
come on we said we were sorry
it’s going to take more than i’m sorry and a storebought apology pie from penny to make up for what you’ve done to me
hey cooper wead your wetwaction email way to destroy your weputation
you see people have been pointing and laughing at me all morning
that’s not twue people have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife
all right i’ve had enough attention everyone i’ m dr sheldon cooper as many of you in the physics department might know my career trajectory has taken a minor detour
my credibility may have been damaged…
but i would like to remind you that in science there’s no such thing as failure there once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career that man’s name was surprise surprise albert einstein
yeah but wesearch into dark energy pwoved that einstein’s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along so you’re still surpwise surpwise a woser
oh you think you’re so clever well let me just tell you while i do not currently have a scathing retort you check your email periodically for a doozy
so much for our friendship with sheldon
well we’ll always have the night the heat went out
hey listen since we got you know interrupted last night i didn’t have a chance to give you this
oh leonard you shouldn’t have oh boy what is it
it’s a snowflake from the north pole
uhhuh it’ll last forever i preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin
oh my god that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that i didn’t understand
it’s actually a pretty simple process you see cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on… she kisses him
red alert leonard sheldon ran away
man i can not catch a break
so how do you know he ran away
well he’s not answering his phone he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said i’m running away
okay well thanks for letting me know
well leonard aren’t you going to do something
of course i’m going to do something uh howard you check the comic book store raj go to the thai restaurant i’ll stay here with penny in her apartment his phone rings oh damn it it’s sheldon’s mother a break cannot be caught hi mrs cooper he is sheldon went home to texas yeah no i know he resigned yes i guess it kind of is our fault no no no you you’re right someone needs to come talk to him don’t worry i’ll take care of it yeah all right new plan howard you and raj go to texas i’ll stay here with penny in her apartment
well you’re not gonna go with them
well you know i gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… oh come on i don’t want to go to texas
oh right and i do my people already crossed a desert once we’re done
trust me you’ll be fine see ya
well wait a second leonard come on how can you not go he’s your best friend
yeah but i already saw him naked just come here
no i promise i will be here when you get back just go help sheldon
yeah we waited a few months we can wait a few more days
boy you cannot catch a break can you
hold your horses young man here in texas we pray before we eat
this is not california land of the heathen gimme by his hand we are all…
please know that we are truly…
amen now that wasn’t so hard was it
my objection was based on considerations other than difficulty
thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich
oh i know how to take care of my baby his eyes came out a little thin but you can just pretend he’s chinese so do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends
all right if you recall when you were little we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids
that was different they were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me
oh baby they knew very well why they hated you
i can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat
hello i’m wearing a red turtleneck plus it was the only boys’ large they had
i’m sorry this does not look like texas where’s the tumbleweeds where’s the saloons
yeah like in the movies i saw growing up in india you know uh four for texas yellow rose of texas
this neighbourhood is more texas chainsaw massacre
i was really hoping to see a cattle drive
what can i tell you they probably have steaks on sale at that bigass costco over there
will you please take that stupid hat off
no i want to blend in
howdy to you too you got here quick
can i… can i get you something to drink
if y’all don’t mind i got a hankerin’ for a lone star beer
there’s no alcohol in this household stop talking like that and lose the hat
sorry i’ll take a diet yoohoo if you have it
you’ll take a cola what about you radge isn’t it oh you still having trouble talking to the ladies because you know at our church we have a woman who’s an amazing healer mostly she does uh crutch and wheelchair people but i bet she’d be willing to take a shot at whatever third world demon is running around inside of you
uh if you don’t mind mrs cooper there’s a 3
oh good i’ve been praying for you oh sheldon
and bring you home so why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back
no this is my home now thanks to you my career is over and i will spend the rest of my life here in texas trying to teach evolution to creationists
you watch your mouth shelly everyone’s entitled to their opinion
evolution isn’t an opinion it’s fact
i forgive you let’s go home
don’t tell me prayer doesn’t work
how about that i finally caught a break
you know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird
why does it have to get weird
i mean we were friends and now we’re more than friends we’re whatever this is but why label it right i mean it is what it is and…
sheldon you’re wrong wolverine was not born with bone claws
howard you know me to be a very smart man don’t you think if i were wrong i’d know it
give it up dude you’re arguing with a crazy person
i’m not crazy my mother had me tested
what do you mean it’s new comic book night
yeah but since you and penny finally hooked up we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yumyum night
there’s more to life than sex raj
okay who had leonard flames out with penny in less than 24 hours”
nothing flamed out we don’t have to have sex every night you know
you don’t have to but it’s highly recommended
yeah take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky
it’s not a matter of opportunity we’re getting to know each other there’s a learning curve
what’s there to learn you get naked do nasty things to each other then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami easy peasy
perhaps what leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction
okay who had leonard gets a floppy disk
oh a clever albeit obsolete euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ
nothing like that happened all right the sex was just fine
just fine oh dude the fourth harry potter movie was just fine
i’m not saying it was bad i’m just saying it… wasn’t great
okay when you say “it wasn’t great do you mean for both of you because we can totally see it not being great for her am i right
to tell you the truth i think we were both a little i don’t know…
all i know is it wasn’t the way i dreamed it would be
sex is never the way i dream it’s gonna be
that’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down
you’re goodnaturedly ribbing me aren’t you
why why would we change we had a perfectly good palace tandoori palace is our palace
trust me this will be just fine
you are the authority on just fine
yeah exactly not bad but not great
i know as i’m sure you’re aware…
if that’s morse code that’s terrible as i was saying you and leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter earlier this evening leonard characterized it as just fine so what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed
okay yeah well i’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside
penny wait aagh what is wrong with you
i sense i may have crossed some sort of line
uh no no no don’t tell him let’s see if he can figure it out
nothing bad just that last night was fine
fine you said it was fine
yeah it’s a perfectly good word you put it in front of wine or dining and you’ve really got something okay well let me ask you this how was last night for you
yeah it’s a perfectly good word i mean you put it in front of dokay and you really got something all right look let’s not overreact you know for a lot of couples it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms learn what the other person wants and likes
so you’ve been through this before
you know i think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better want a glass of wine
okay see we should’ve done this last night you know have a little wine take the edge off
actually ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gammaaminobutyric acid
no you’re misunderstanding a shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them we prey on them
whatever dude the point is leonard’s got one and you don’t
is this it it was inappropriate to discuss leonard and penny’s sex life in front of leonard and penny howard indicates that he has got it oh good now i can eat
hang on based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room it is a snowy tree cricket
oh give me a frickin’ break how could you possibly know that
in 1890 emile dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature a precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets
how do you know what the exact temperature of the room is
under the terms of my roommate agreement with leonard i’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06
okay you were right about wolverine and bone claws but you’re wrong about the cricket
howard don’t embarrass yourself the science chirps for itself humorous word play
no no not this time i know insects my friend i spent many childhood years capturing them with nets putting them in glass jars sticking pins through them mounting them on corrugated cardboard with dymo labels underneath identifying the genus and species in latin
oh dude you are never getting a shiksa goddess
that is a snowy tree cricket oecanthus fultoni i was done with latin by fifth grade
okay okay tell you what i am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket
i’ve always found that an inappropriate slur chickens are not by nature at all timid in fact when i was young my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house
okay i believe a chicken made you his bitch but the cricket thing i don’t buy bet me
fair enough what stake do you propose
i will put up my fantastic four number 48 first appearance of silver surfer against your flash 123 the classic flash of two worlds issue
all right you have a wager
great now how are you going to settle it hmm there is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it
i wonder what the nonpathetic people are doing tonight
hallway all try to exit at once and get stuck in doorway
one at a time same thing happens again eventually they leave the apartment there is a growling noise what was that
my stomach indian food doesn’t agree with me ironic isn’t it
are you crazy we can’t go down an empty elevator shaft
fine if you don’t want to proceed then you forfeit the bet and i’ll take possession of your fantastic four
are you bothered that i can so easily manipulate you
don’t push me sheldon i may be small but i took kung fu when i was 13 and i remember a good deal of it
oh really well i grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and i believe i could easily best you in any physical confrontation be it noogies swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself
ooh big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken
why would you buy peppermint schnapps
because i like peppermint and it’s fun to say schnapps hey leonard
schnapps you’re right that is fun
if i were not being careful your telling me to be careful would not make me careful
uhoh flashlight went out i need some batteries fellas hello it’s really dark down here
oh sweetie you really can’t hold your liquor can you
i’m okay just a little mouthwash and then i’m gonna rock your world penny vomits in sink are you okay vomits in toilet again
ugh toby what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now
his name isn’t toby toby is an absurd name for a cricket
an appropriate cricket name for example jiminy
all right sheldon here we go kleingast’s field guide to north american insects hey toby right here see it the common field cricket aka gryllus assimilis which is latin for suck it you lose
hang on voilà the snowy tree cricket aka oecanthus fultoni which is latin for i’ll suck nothing of course i’m joking because the latin for that is nihil exsorbibo
that is not toby this is toby raj what do you think
oh i really don’t care anymore
god i had the most horrible night
obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess
forgive me yiddish was not spoken in east texas and if it was it wasn’t spoken for long
yeah fine whatever the point is you’re wrong again
we haven’t established that i’m wrong once
all right tell you what let’s go down to the entomology department and let professor
he’s a snowy tree cricket and his name is jiminy they leave
i bet i could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends
holy crap it’s like silence of the lambs down here howard tickles the back of his neck he screams don’t do that
you’re such a girl they’re just bugs
yeah well i don’t like bugs okay they freak me out
interesting you’re afraid of insects and women ladybugs must render you catatonic it was a joke i made it to lessen your discomfort you’re welcome
don’t knock just walk in why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle
excuse me are you professor crawley
i’m dr cooper from the physics department
i haven’t even packed yet and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines
no you don’t understand we just want to ask you a question
let me ask you one first what’s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab huh
ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable
what’s your deal are they planning to outsource my job to bangalore
i’m from new delhi maybe you should find another entomologist
no no we’re here let’s settle this professor can you identify our cricket
of course i can i can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet not that that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in oxnard and we’re not talking oxnard at the beach no we’re talking oxnard in the onion fields
well could you look at toby
toby what a stupid name for a cricket
no no wait dr crawley are you sure
young man i’ve been studying insects since i was eight years old you know what they used to call me in school creepy crawley
cruel as that may be that is not in itself a credential
let me show you something see that that’s a crawley’s dung beetle i discovered it after spending six months slogging through a bornean rain forest while my wife was back home shacking up with a twobit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear bootcut jeans so when i tell you that that’s a common field cricket you can take that to the damn bank cause god knows i can’t that tramp took me for everything
well apparently i was wrong congratulations
enjoy oxnard i’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you
oh hey sheldon what you got there a new comic book
old comic book i just retrieved it from my safe deposit box
what do you have a safe deposit box for
old comic books i lost this to wolowitz in an illconsidered cricket wager
what do they have wii cricket now that can’t be very popular
penny i’d rather not talk about it
well if it makes you feel any better i’m not feeling so hot either
why would that make me feel better
i don’t know empathy anyway i’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with howard and i’m upset about something with leonard
yes yes the disappointing sex that’s an inexact parallel you and leonard can always return to being friends whereas i can never return to a state in which wolowitz has not bested me like mrs riley’s chicken
a chicken that was owned by mrs riley
no no you may be right about me and leonard
of course i’m right what are the odds i’d be wrong twice in one week
no i mean we can always go back to being friends
i just said that this conversation has started to circle meeting adjourned
oh you’d like to catch up on the events of the day all right well there was a halfhour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box i was forced to talk to penny about your sexual problems and oh yes in a moment filled with biblical resonance pride wenteth before my fall causing my flash 123 to goeth to wolowitz
wait a minute you talked to penny about our sex life
leonard it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial i lost a bet to wolowitz
right right you’re saying you talked to penny
have i crossed some sort of line again
hey uh what did sheldon say to you
not a lot just that we always have the option of going back to being friends
i don’t know i mean you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends
it would take the pressure off
come here she gives him a hug it turns into a big kiss
morning sheldon come dance with me
penny while i subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of sheldons in an infinite number of universes i assure you that in none of them am i dancing
are you fun in any of them
the math would suggest that in a few i’m a clown made of candy but i don’t dance
all right want some french toast
tell you what next french toast day i will make you oatmeal
dear lord are you still going to be here on french toast day
look leonard penny made french toast
sorry i haven’t given her your schedule yet
it’s an ical download she can put it right in her phone and i thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment
we did but there were extenuating circumstances
i see did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness
no her bed kind of… broke
that doesn’t seem likely her bed’s of sturdy construction even the addition
sorry okay who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar
yes well i want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass
i’m sure that will happen soon enough but in the meantime i still want oatmeal
you know what i give up he’s impossible
i can’t be impossible i exist i believe what you meant to say is “i give up he’s improbable”
sheldon you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny
what am i supposed to do eat french toast on a monday now that would be impossible
i’m just saying you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
you can catch even more flies with manure what’s your point
boy that does smell good too bad it’s monday
okay so kim the night manager went on maternity leave and her husband’s name is sandy right so get this her replacement is a woman named sandy whose husband’s name is kim
i know what are the odds
easily calculable we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names we then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work the aged the imprisoned and the limbless for example next we look at…
sheldon it’s an amazing coincidence can we leave it at that
i’m sorry ooh penny it’s as if the cheesecake factory is run by witches
ooh sheldon it’s as if you don’t think i’ll punch you
come on you guys let it go
well thank you how thoughtful would you like a chocolate
you said be nice to penny i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice
it does but in my experience you don’t
there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
yeah yeah now that’s you obnoxious and insufferable
oh man did the kiss army repeal don’t ask don’t tell
no raj and i are going a goth club in hollywood to hang with the night people anybody want to come along
oh wow you’re actually going out like that
no no i’m going out like this whips off jacket to reveal tattoos up both arms
they’re called tattoo sleeves look i bought them online raj got a set too fantastic right put them on have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced take them off and i can still be buried in a jewish cemetery
you know i’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub
bazinga none of you ever see my practical jokes coming do you
okay how about you two look i’ve got some extra tat sleeves
well in case i snag one on someone’s nipple ring
uh yeah i think we’ll pass
oh is the missus speaking for the couple now
in this case you bet she is
yes she’s pushy and yes he’s whipped but that’s not the expression come on i want to stop at walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner
they’re gonna get beaten up at that club
they’re gonna get beaten up at walgreens oh sorry sheldon i almost sat in your spot
did you i didn’t notice have a chocolate
i think we’re fitting in quite nicely
it’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer
oh what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice
hello it looks like blood did you even read the wiki how link i sent you on being goth
no i’m behind on my wikireading i’m kind of on a john grisham kick right now
well i finished reading the pelican brief and loved it so much i dived right into the client he was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining
just remember we are lost boys children of the night
great lost boys children of the night got it can you pass the chex mix please thank you we are lost boys
i’m actually much morelost than he is
thanks can we buy you ladies a drink
light beers well wikihow about that
do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of john grisham
and it’s not a cartoon it’s anime
anime you know i knew a girl in high school named anna may anna may fletcher she was born with one nostril then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three
oh am i talking too much i’m sorry zip
yes please her phone rings oh hey kim yeah i… sees sheldon looking disapprovingly you know what hold on let me take this in the hall sheldon silently offers her another chocolate she takes it you’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
okay i know what you’re doing
yes you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour
no i don’t want any chocolate sheldon you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat
actually it turns out i can
there’s just no pleasing you is there leonard you weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her so i decided to employ operant conditioning techniques building on the work of thorndike and bf skinner by this time next week i believe i can have her jumping out of a pool balancing a beach ball on her nose
no this has to stop now
i’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool i thought the “bazinga” was implied i’m just tweaking her personality sanding off the rough edges if you will
are you saying that i’m forbidden from applying a harmless scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better
so what do you guys do
oh you know goth stuff goth magazines goth music
no i meant what do you do for jobs
yeah you know the dark sciences
well i am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night when there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about
does it okay if you like space stuff i design components for the international space station which is in space where as i’m sure you know no one can hear you scream
so what do you gals do
really how about that i’ve been to the gap
yeah i’ve been there as well i like your teeshirts with the little pocket
i work there too not that anyone cares you know this place is boring
yeah why don’t we go somewhere else and have some fun
come on i know a place you’ll really dig
did you bring the black condoms
what could she possibly be talking about for so long
obviously waitressing at the cheesecake factory is a complex socioeconomic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning bazinga you know using positive reinforcement techniques i could train that behaviour out of her in a week
if you let me use negative reinforcement i can get it done before we go to bed
you’re not squirting her in the face with water
no of course not we’re talking very mild electric shocks no tissue damage whatsoever
oh come on you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend
i’m not and penny’s qualities both good and bad are what make her who she is
you mean like that highpitched irritating laugh
you’re not changing how penny laughs
no that would be incongruous i was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register
uh sorry guys that girl is high pitched freaky
are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar
what is your mother going to say
she’s not going to see it she takes my temperature orally now
what are you going to get howard
well i can’t really decide between a screaming devil this mean little skull or kermit the frog
you know kermit voice hi ho i’m on howard’s butt
get the mean little skull and i’ll see if i can make him smile
yeah i’d like the mean little skull please
what are you going to get raj
i know but it was cold ow ow ow
aaaaaargh okay that’s it no needle no pain no tattoo
what’s the big deal you’ve done this before
no i haven’t look rips off tattoo sleeves i’m sorry i’m a fraud he’s a fraud
yeah i think i covered that
we’re not goth we’re just guys
so you were totally scamming us
yes and i wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive
i’m leaving too not that anyone cares
when we tell this story let’s end it differently
what are you thinking maybe a big musical number
well i’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in i trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum
thank you throws a chocolate penny catches it in her mouth
i was just thinking we should probably turn in too
well my new bed got delivered if you come over and put it together you can stay at my place
really that’s a lot of work and it’s kind of late
yeah but if we stay there we won’t have to be quiet
interesting sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour i wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that
okay wait how about this we say there were four goth girls the two girls in the club had two friends
i like it i like it did they smell good despite their gothlike nature
what’s that got to do with the story
engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me
oh they did like jasmine and honeysuckle
and then they held hands and did a sexy demonic hokeypokey for us
no no look let me say my story all the way through and then you can say yours and then we’ll pick
okay we got tattoos and then the four girls took us to their place
but we don’t have tattoos what if someone asks to see our tattoos
we say they’re in a very intimate area
oh we are bad boys aren’t we
right right so we go back to their place and then the six of us end up in a hot tub
but we just got tattoos wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection
true okay forget the hot tub the point is we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls
yeah hey want to try a country bar tomorrow night
yeah maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls
this movie baffles me every time we watch it
well the instructions are very clear don’t feed the gremlins after midnight don’t get the gremlins wet how hard is that
ooh we’re honey now are we
yes since their relationship became carnal penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie usually in an attempt to soften a thinlyveiled insult
although sometimes she omits the veil entirely
so what are you guys doing
we’re watching goonies gremlins and young sherlock holmes they were all written by chris columbus
okay what do you watch on thanksgiving
oh you know that reminds me i usually go back to nebraska for thanksgiving but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial
oh just a big misunderstanding you know you’d actually like my brother he’s kind of a chemist anyway i was thinking i’d have thanksgiving here and you are all invited
will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce
i guess i could serve both
you guess you don’t seem to have much of a handle on this
yeah i really wish i could penny but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous turbriskafil
turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish it’s not as good as it sounds
oh he usually comes to my house right pal raj bursts into tears and runs away all right this year you don’t have to eat the turbriskafil i don’t even chew it i swallow it like pills
so what’s going on with raj
well the good news is he has no problem with my mother’s turbrkafil
hard to believe but go on
the bad news is he says he’s getting deported
what do you mean he’s getting deported
i believe it means that the us government is going to expel him from the country he could then either return to his native india emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate personally i’d choose pirate
penny would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him
ugh fine but the man really needs to work on his girl issues
another reason to consider a life of piracy even today i understand that’s an allmale profession
okay here’s the deal six months ago my research testing the predicted composition of transneptunian objects ran into a dead end
so my visa’s only good as long as i’m employed at the university and when they find out i’ve got squat they’re going to cut me off by the way when i say squat i mean diddlysquat i wish i had squat
so wait what have you been doing for the past six months
you know checking email updating my facebook status messing up wikipedia entries hey did you know netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now
and you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences highly unethical for an astrophysicist although practically mandatory for a pirate
i don’t want to go back to india it’s hot and loud and there’s so many people you have no idea they’re everywhere
okay guys think how do we keep raj in the country
why doesn’t he just get another job
what are you asking me for i don’t know if you can talk now or not
oh beef i’m going to miss you so much do you know at the mumbai mcdonald’s you can’t get a big mac all you can get is a chicken maharaja mac and the special sauce curry which in india
don’t worry you’ll find another job
yeah let me start practicing for it do you want fries with that maharaja mac”
forgive me as you know i’m no adept at reading facial cues but i’m going to take a stab here you’re either sad or nauseated
i was going to say sad i don’t know why i hedged
elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce
oh beefaroni i think i’ll miss you most of all
i’ve always been a little confused about this why don’t hindus eat beef
not technically in hinduism cattle are thought to be like god
do not tell me about my own culture sheldon in the mood i’m in i’ll take you out i swear to cow
me too i’m just i’m a little on edge
understandable your entire life seems to be crumbling around you and your future appears bleak at best
and you’re wrong about hinduism and cows
hey raj guess what professor laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team
come on what are you waiting for call him and set up an interview
dr koothrappali come on in i was surprised to hear you were interested in joining our little team giving up on those transneptunian objects are we
no no it’s a very promising area in a perfect world i’d spend several more years on it but i just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis
splendid uh please sit down can i offer you a sherry
it’s a little early isn’t it
that’s very good jolly amusing but if you don’t mind i’ll hold off until sunset on titan
oh well done i have a feeling you’re going to fit in just fine dr koothrappali
thank you sir there is a knock on the door a young woman enters
no no no right on time dr koothrappali may i present dr millstone from mit she’ll be heading up our data analysis team
well i ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency
thank you would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub so when do i start
what do you mean you didn’t get the job how could you not get it
you know he’s british i’m indian ever since gandhi they haven’t liked us very much
wait are you saying that he discriminated against you because we should file a complaint
that’s okay a complaint has been filed so that’s it that was my last hope i’m going to be deported sent home in disgrace exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin sanjay or as you may know him dave from att customer service
i’m really going to miss you
will you come visit me in india
gee that’s like a 17hour flight how about i meet you halfway
halfway is 600 miles off the coast of japan
raj did you get the job with professor laughlin
i assumed as much but never fear like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel i have returned to save the day odd usually he’s met by cheers anyway i was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations and it occurred to me that i could benefit…
excuse me sheldon how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point
i’m sorry if you didn’t cheer at my entrance it’s too late to buy into the premise anyway i got some extra money from the head of the department and raj can come work for me
you want me to work with you
for me you’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job
okay uh please don’t take this the wrong way but i’d rather swim bucknaked across the ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you
yes please after about 30 seconds how may i help you
i’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you
yes for you i do however have a few conditions first at all times i am to be treated as a colleague and an equal second my contributions shall be noted in all published material and third you are never allowed to lecture me on hinduism or my indian culture
i’m impressed raj those are very cogent and reasonable conditions
then you leave me no choice i accept the job
i’m sorry i believe you’ve misunderstood i’m not giving you the job i’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it have a seat we’ll get started with the interview
so that’s what you wear to an interview
come on dude we’ve been friends for years
sheldon for god’s sakes don’t make me beg
bazinga you’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes i’m your boss now you may want to laugh at that
ah it’s nice having the place to ourselves isn’t it
uhhuh now that raj is working for sheldon i don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore plus yeah with them working late so much we get some privacy
mmhmm hey want to get a little crazy
let’s slide over to sheldon’s spot a make out
oh god how did he know
tonight’s the night i usually go line dancing with raj at the palomino
okay i guess i can hang for a little while so what are we watching sex and the city
hey i happen to love this movie
fine let’s watch it maybe all our periods will synchronize
all right we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space
ooh dark matter we better bring a flashlight i was making a joke
i’m the boss i make the jokes
sorry go ahead and make your joke
this is not the time for joking we’re doing serious research which requires complete and utter focus
all right let’s buckle down and work
leonard honey you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex
oh okay tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail just throw it away
well usually on sundays i go with raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market but he’s still working with sheldon so i thought i’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami it’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour
by the way i couldn’t help overhearing your big finish bravo leonard
see if you had killed me when i said kill me i wouldn’t have had to hear that
what do you guys think want to take in a matinee maybe go rollerblading catch a step class
yeah okay um howard we need to talk
uh please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around but penny and i occasionally need some alone time
oh i get it i’m the third wheel sorry i should have seen that i’ll get out of your way uh you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot
thank you there’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge the bagels are in the oven i was warming them up
ill just hang out with my mom that’s always fun
i don’t know what do you want me to do
oh you guys had me scared for a minute
no no no no that rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space
of course i understand and who are you to tell me about outer space
i’m the astrophysicist astro means space
okay well let me just tell you if we were having this argument in my native language i’d be kicking your butt
okay you got me there but you’re wrong about this
there is a fine line between wrong and visionary unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it
my god you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold well let me tell you something some of those thoughts are pure caca
all right first of all dr koothrappali when i first proposed that you work with me…
aha so i am working with you
in this context with me means for me
ah well in this context… blows raspberry
oh if i’m wrong prove it
okay here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle
no no no you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target
i’m not defacing it i’m fixing it
i said give it to me
fine uses hand as an eraser then realises his hand is dirty oh lord dr koothrappali as your superior i forbid you from writing on my board
oh yeah can you do this performs  complex finger trick nice working with you i’m sorry for you exits sheldon stares a moment then tries to perform the trick fails
knock knock knock raj knock knock knock raj knock knock knock raj
doing what performs finger trick again all right you’ve made your point
i looked over the board and it turns out you were right
nevertheless i didn’t say it anyway i would like you to come back and work for me
in this context for me could mean with me
all right but i have some conditions
i’ll take the job see you monday
wait you have to drive me home
i can’t there’s a big dog outside on the way home we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 gev particles
all right as they walk down the corridor eye of the tiger starts playing again
all right raj has played his phantom warlord card and i am going to back him up with my strangling vines choke on that sucka
okay well then i’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword that’s right i did it i cut ’em
warlord beats troll troll beats elf elf beats water sprite and basically everything beats enchanted bunny
unless you have the carrot power
okay i’ve got another question when does this get fun
are we going to talk or are we going to play mystic warlords of kaah
it doesn’t matter you can’t possibly win
how could he ruin the game
given the cards that have already been played penny can only be holding necromancer potions which are only effective against wraiths and daywalkers and there are no more of either left to be drawn the cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons a troll two ogres and the jewel of osiris
from your vantage point it certainly must seem so
sheldon has kind of a photographic memory
photographic is a misnomer i have an eidetic memory as i’ve told you many times most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh you had turkey and complained it was dry
really oh great i mean aw okay i gotta go
because the last me i didn’t go i ended up playing mystic warlords of ka
see ya still can’t believe she’s going out with me
that reminds me i have a bone to pick with you
you and i made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends
june 30th 2004 opening day of spiderman 2 at the amc pasadena they only had red icees no blue
so you’ve been with penny for like a month and a half now where’s my shorty morty
howard you can’t hold me to that
because when i made that agreement i didn’t think i’d ever have a hot girlfriend and i was positive you never would
hey how come i wasn’t part of this deal
you had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive preshow urination
oh so that’s how it works i have a teeny bladder and now i don’t get a hot girlfriend
yeah raj that’s how it works
oh damn it can i have a napkin
but you have a whole bunch of ’em
yes i’ve moved to a fournapkin system lap hands face and personal emergencies if you like starting tomorrow i’ll add a guest napkin but i’m afraid there’s nothing i can do for you today leonard steals a napkin good luck that’s the face napkin
so have you talked to penny yet
because i’ve been busy because i haven’t figured out a way to bring it up and mostly and i can’t stress how key this is because i don’t want to
leonard a pact is a pact you have to get penny to fix me up
it’s not that simple what am i supposed to say penny do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again
come on i’m smart i have good job and i have only three percent body fat
it’s true i’ve seen him at the beach he’s like a human chicken wing
fine i’ll ask if she has a friend for you
and tall i want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20
i’ll see what i can do
hey sheldon guess what i heard today
i’d imagine you heard any number of things today when you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard hello raj how are you raj given that you’re wearing a new sweatervest you may have heard new sweatervest and possibly though far less likely nice sweatervest
why don’t i just tell you what i heard today
that would probably save us some time
saturday night at the comic book store they’re having a mystic warlords of kaah tournament first prize is five hundred dollars if we team up we’d be unstoppable
i’m sorry raj but i have no interest in playing a game in which i find no challenge
how does it different from the money i have
half of it will be mine
do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweatervest
are you kidding i couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins
wow you really are a genius
not really i googled how to do that so listen have you ever made a pact with someone
you mean like a pinky swear
okay fine like a pinky swear
well in the first grade my friend rosie and i made a pact to marry bert and ernie you know from sesame street
yeah i’m familiar with bert and ernie
then we found out we both wanted ernie we didn’t speak again until middle school
the heart wants what the heart wants leonard
okay speaking of what the heart wants um a long time ago i made a pact with wolowitz that kind of involves you
okay i don’t know where you’re going with this but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have
no no nothing like that the deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends
and you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex
well i sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex and during i was trying to remember what i read on google so…
i’m not hooking wolowitz up with one of my friends
come on it doesn’t have to be a good friend and you know that deep down inside howard’s a really nice guy
the problem isn’t what’s on the inside it’s the creepy candy coating
will you at least think about it just as a favour to me
oh great thing about ernie was he never asked me for anything he just gave
got it got it got it got it got it got it betty and veronica ugh
hey sheldon the new green lantern figurine’s coming in tomorrow want me to set one aside for you
thank you you just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the ohsosatisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession
all right i won’t set one aside for you
okay i’ll set one aside for you
thank you you know i can buy all these things online i come here for the personal service
hey stuart is the wil wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament the wil wheaton from star trek
yeah he lives around here big gamer
excuse me are you saying that wil wheaton aka ensign wesley crusher on star trek
oh i’m sorry did i rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself
you don’t understand growing up i idolized wil wheaton wesley crusher had an eidetic memory just like me
oh what a coincidence maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament sign here
i was such a fan that in 1995 i travelled ten hours by bus to a scifi convention in jackson mississippi wearing my star fleet academy cadet uniform in order to meet wil wheaton and get him to autograph my mint inpackage wesley crusher action figure
ooh it’ll be like a reunion then sign here
my arduous journey however was for naught although advertised to appear he did not show up it was at that moment i vowed eternal hatred for wil wheaton
okay great you can tell him you hate him sign here
it might also interest you to know that wil wheaton currently ranks sixth on my alltime enemies list right between director joel schumacher who nearly destroyed the batman movie franchise and billy sparks who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle
okay i get it he’s a bad guy sign here
in the words of khan noonien singh in the immortal wrath of khan he tasks me he tasks me and i shall have him
from hell’s heart i stab at thee
all right raj looks like you’re teamed up with die wil wheaton die
so tell me more about the future mother of my children
she’s adorable howard i think you’ll like her
great so what did you tell her about me did you mention the body fat
no i thought that would be a nice surprise for her
i just told her you’re an aerospace engineer you speak five languages…
girls don’t count klingon howard right
right oh and i told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother
my enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace game
sorry boys say hi to your mother when she picks you up or i could just tell her later tonight we pwned them dude up top
look at him wil wheaton my old friend i have chased you round the moons of nibia and round the antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames
you know you keep quoting wrath of khan but he was in next generation it’s a totally different set of characters
silence how much longer must i wait for my revenge
well if wil wheaton and stuart win their match and we beat lonely larry and captain sweatpants in the next round we’ll face off for the championship
so my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely larry and captain sweatpants very well they must be destroyed
dude you have to stop talking like that it’s really lame
so penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school that’s pretty great what are you studying
oh cool so you could study me
microbiology is the study of tiny living things
and i said you could study me ’cause i’m a tiny living thing it’s a joke
like in the bedroom or like dungeons and dragons
i had to ask you didn’t have to say yes
i play my endless serpent raj will play ecstatic frenzy which means larry will have to play chaos overlord then captain sweatpants molten river i play nightshade dryad game set and match now fetch me wil wheaton bortas bir jablu’di’ reh qaqqu’ nay’
did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in klingon
how about computers do you like computers
i use them i don’t like them
okay… puppies where do you stand on puppies
a puppy once bit my face
how about that einstein was wrong
approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time approaching them does
excuse me oh damn it’s my mother
are you going to answer it
i’m torn she might be dying and you know i wouldn’t want to miss that on the other hand if i let it go to voicemail i could play it over and over
i know how you feel my mother makes me crazy
not as crazy as my mother makes me
oh yeah does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch
my mother calls me at work to see if i had a healthy bowel movement
okay well does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old
ooh rough okay check this out my mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so i wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children
that’s nothing i couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid i’d hit a bump and lose my virginity
oh wow you didn’t did you
not on a bicycle in a camry
listen you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime
a catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm i’ve been hoping for
okay but only if you come to sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke
am i a matchmaker or what
underworld guardian we skirmish to the death
you’re holding two moderate spell cards a small rock and a potion of zancor which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet hoth your only move is to play the potion lose the skirmish and two moves later the game
the year was 1995 the place jackson mississippi having spent ten hours on a bus during which i had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle i finally arrived at the fourth annual dixietrek convention only to find that my idol wil wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure
you betrayed me wil wheaton now i have my revenge
you went to the ’95 dixietrek oh dude my grandmother had just died and i had to go to her funeral
yeah it was but i’m really sorry that i disappointed you
no no i understand anything happened to my meemaw i’d be one inconsolable moon pie i should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie
it’s special relationship isn’t it between a boy and his grandmother
okay great everybody loves their grandmas now come on sheldon finish him off
it’s okay sheldon i let you down i deserve it potion of zancor
what are you waiting for kill wil wheaton from hell’s heart stab at him
sure you can do it do it
no i came here to defeat wil wheaton the man who destroyed my dreams but i can’t defeat wil wheaton the man who loved his meemaw enchanted bunny
i call my meemaw nana and she’s going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny game over moon pie
i… i… i don’t understand your grandmother’s alive
oh you catch on quick come on stewie let’s get our prize money
excuse me you’re misusing the word ho it’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination not an object as in uh land ho or uh westward ho
hey guys what you doing going out to discover electricity
if you’re referring to the work of benjamin franklin he did not discover electricity he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity he also invented the franklin stove bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter kites ho
we’re heading out for some kite fighting
oh yeah it’s an extremely competitive cutthroat sport
well actually the risk of throat cutting is very low on the other hand severe string burn is a real and everpresent danger
oh gee sounds amazing but um i’ve got some friends coming over not a big thing we’re just gonna watch the nebraska game
i would’ve invited you but i know you’re not a football fan
no no i’m not so great you’ve got plans doing something you like i’ve got plans doing something i like so it’s good
well maybe we’ll hang out later you know after everybody’s gone
i’m sorry i got bored and drifted off where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie
leonard just realized that penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny little man who flies kites
wolowitz is trying to outflank us let out some string add altitude and i’ll go under and cut his line
why wouldn’t penny want her friends to meet me
focus leonard focus the heat of battle is upon us the dogs of war are unleashed
maybe koothrappali’s right maybe i embarrass her
you’re embarrassing me right now a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites
sorry won’t bring their kites down ow string burn string burn
oh they think we’re flanking they’re playing right into our hands on the count of three we execute the flying scissor one two…
that chick she smiled at me
wait what are you doing i can’t scissors by myself howard come back
you’re a sucky friend you know that a sucky sucky friend
what was i supposed to do she gave me that comehither look
if she gave you any look at l it was a you suck look
i would’ve caught up to her if i hadn’t pulled a hammy
oh please you weigh 80 pounds you don’t have a hammy
so penny doesn’t want me around her friends i embarrass her what else could it be
well her actions could be out of concern for your feelings perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you
agreed most primates don’t show that sort of discretion a female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do
you always do this you know you ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with
with a woman you were chasing through a park that’s not a shot that’s a felony what’s worse it cost me my prized patang fighting kite sheldon i don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back
i’m sorry raj but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor and without rules the competition has no meaning and without meaning the following would be an empty gesture sings i have your kite i have your kite
it was pretty good we won
oh that’s excellent it’s a weird figure of speech isn’t it we won when you weren’t
oh hey on a related subject are you embarrassed to have me around your friends
oh my god no why would you ask that
well you know i just noticed i haven’t really met any of them
well yeah no i met the huge exboyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me exboyfriend were they here today
of course not why would they be why would i ask why am i rambling why don’t you stop me
leonard look if you want to meet my friends that would be great i just you know i didn’t want you to be bored
i wouldn’t be bored why would i be bored
well ’cause they’re not genius scientists
penny i like all sorts of people in fact some of my best friends aren’t geniuses
okay some of my facebook friends aren’t geniuses my point is if we’re going to be a couple i should be friends with your friends
okay great well then why don’t you come over next saturday and watch the game with us
you wanted to meet my friends
sure sure just i don’t know much about football
oh that’s okay a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football they just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen
okay a complete pass first down new england i think i’m starting to get this
really the only thing i’ve learned in the last two hours is that american men love drinking beer pee too often and have trouble getting erections
focus on the game not the commercials raj
i’m just saying maybe if you people cut back on the beer you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help
raj what are you doing here you were supposed to help me pimp out my vespa
i’m sorry are you under the impression that we’re still friends
oh come on you’re not still grinding on the kite thing are you
it’s not just the kite thing every time we go some place you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along even though you don’t have a shot with them
but i had a shot with that jogger
fine paint green flames on your little scooter with her leaves
it’s not a little scooter it’s the second biggest vespa they make are you watching football
there’s no fooling you now what is this sacks statistic they put up there
all i know about saks is my mother shops there
it’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage
the line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence
i mean quidditch sure but football
sheldon how do you know this stuff
i grew up in texas football is ubiquitous in texas pro football college football high school football peewee football in fact every form of football except the original european football which most texans believe to be a commie plot
if you’re interested i also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken
football i’m going to penny’s on saturday to watch a game with her friends and i don’t want to look like an idiot i want to blend in
if you want to blend in with penny’s friends i’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage
come on sheldon please teach me about football it’ll be fun
that’s exactly what my father said come to the games watch the games week in and week out from the time i was five until i went off to college longest seven years of my life
please i’m asking you as a friend
are you making this a tier one friendship request
yeah yeah all right poindexter sit down shut up and listen
that’s how my father always began our football conversations and if you’d like after the game i’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself
when are you going to stop making cylon toast
when i have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as galactica is that what you’re wearing to watch football at penny’s
what’s wrong with a football jersey
nothing that however appears to be a football cocktail dress
i’s the smallest size they had except the one for dogs i can’t believe they had one for dogs
oh yes canine football fans are a common sight in texas cats however refuse to wear sporting apparel my sister found that out the hard way
leonard wait am i correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her
well i wouldn’t put it exactly that way
huh seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse don’t you have access to women who will do it for money by the way another accepted usage for the term ho
hold on i believe that social convention dictate you not arrive emptyhanded would you like to bring some cylon toast
yeah no i’m trying to fit in not get laughed at
i brought you a little gift new kite
the kite you made me lose was an authentic patang an indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from new delhi it took me a day to put together and two days to paint this is hello kitty
yeah but it comes with a little coin purse does a patang
wow you just don’t get it do you buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away
look i admit i haven’t always been the best friend i could be
you’ve been a sucky friend a sucky sucky friend
and you do it all the time last week in the mall at radio shack we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother and i suddenly realize you’re not even there
getting shot down by the girl at hot dog on a stick but in my defence she was gorgeous and working that squeezer to make the lemonade going up and down and up and down it was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court
hey at least i can talk to women without being drunk
excuse me i have selective mutism a recognized medical disorder you’re just a douche
no you know what maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about you’re not mad at me you’re mad at yourself
no i’m mad at you i hate myself but i’m mad at you
fine you’re mad at me i get it now how about we go spend the day together just the two of us we’ll go anywhere you want
come on let me take you someplace nice
i… i do enjoy the la brea tar pits
really now with the traffic and the parking it’s… okay fine the tar pits let’s go
oh why can’t i stay mad at you
go go go gogogogo yes are you people watching this is this amazing or what
sweetie that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game
how much beer have you had
oh i was just kind of hoping you were drunk now we’re back live
okay yeah i can see the difference
that completely was a forward pass which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time i can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul
penny you know i’m lactose intolerant
i know i just need you stop talking
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
thank you i’d like to make a sandwich but i’m out of bread
you shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules which occurs faster at cool temperatures
on earth we say thank you
so leonard how goes the mimesis
you know mimesis an action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism mimesis
what the hell are you talking about
i’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you let me try again have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own nudge nudge wink wink
good oh fyi after i eat my sandwich i’m taking koothrappali’s patang kite out for a test run would you like to get your deltawing raptor and join me
i don’t want to fly kites sheldon we’re watching football here
i can see that i was providing you with an alternative a courtesy i was never offered in similar circumstances
oh look at that the oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field i hope he’s right ’cause if he’s not it’ll cost him one of his three timeouts
you know leonard honey i wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with sheldon
no i’ll watch the end of the game besides there’s only three minutes left
this is just half we’ve been here for hours
and you’re gonna be here for a couple more
so yeah anyway that’s my boyfriend he is really smart
i really like my sabertoothed cat thank you
my pleasure maybe after lunch we can go to marie callender’s and have some pie
i’d like that this is turning out to be a perfect saturday
good i’m glad oh man did you see the way she smiled at me
if you want to chase after her chase after her
ah who am i kidding i wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that
don’t put yourself down you’re a very attractive man
yeah absolutely it wouldn’t kill you to take a pilates class with me now and then but you have a certain wiry appeal
yeah well it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me
actually in this case i think she was
wow sheldon i cannot believe you made up your own game
oh research lab is more than a game it’s like the slogan says the physics is theoretical but the fun is real
we must not be playing it right
all right five one two three four five oh wow look at that my department of defence research grant is renewed
oh great roll now you can demolish your sovietstyle cyclotron and build the large hadron collider
you’re a natural at this penny and as the first beta testers you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with wolowitz and koothrappali on sunday
oh gee sheldon i don’t think we can play on sunday
because of the reasons that penny will now tell you penny
actually i have to pick up my friend justin from the airport
there you go she has to pick up her friend justin at the airport aand i can’t play ’cause i’m going with her right
um yeah if you want i mean there may not be room he’s got a lot of stuff like guitars and amplifiers
wait what are you talking about
pay attention leonard that’s why she can’t play on sunday
yeah my friend from omaha plays the guitar anyway he’s coming to la looking for some session work so i told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks
come on leonard if you roll a six penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown see what i mean when i say the fun is real
hang on some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch
he’s not some guy he’s my friend
so by friend do you mean friend friend gay friend or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”
oh a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch yippee
okay we went out a little bit a long time ago but we were never like going out
okay not to be pedantic but the last i checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out which i think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked
do you have a problem with justin staying with me
you know what don’t talk to me like i’m an idiot
i’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot i’m saying the whole idea is idiotic
you accidentally stare at a heliumargon laser lose one turn and a retina
how is that not talking to me like i’m an idiot it’s my friend it’s my couch and it’s my freakin’ life
you know what it is your life if you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch then fine why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite the black eyed peas
hey if i want to invite the entire line up of lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment i will and it’s none of your business
are you listening to yourself do you know how childish you sound right now
oh now i’m a child well at least i’m not an idiot anymore
oh you are such a… sheldon has placed ice in the blender and turned it on what the hell is he doing
he’s drowning us out he doesn’t like fighting
sheldon just stop look the fight is over oh and fyi you never even heard of the black eyed peas until you met me
i heard of ’em didn’t know they were a band sheldon she’s gone you can turn off the blender
has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end
no we just had a little spat
look on the bright side as the result of penny’s forfeit you have become the world’s first winner of research lab would you like a commemorative snow cone
i don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch
hey i thought of a game we can play in the car
i don’t want to play a game sheldon
it’s called scientists now i will name three scientists then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields to make this game even more compelling you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field not the validity of the field itself for example abu musa jabir ibn hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than halbert vanderplatt made to neurobiology okay ready to have some fun
an old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay that’s what a guy likes to hear definitely
all right i’ll start with an easy one um isaac newton madame curie and niels bohr
and then i say one little thing and i end up being the bad guy
hint madame curie had her husband to help her
what am i supposed to say sure penny i’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment well leonard it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because i’m penny and i’m pretty and i can do whatever the hell i want oh i get it you think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me no no leonard i’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you
i can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore
come on come on we’re late
calm down we’ll make the movie
i believe my alarm is appropriate given the situation the movie starts in 17 minutes which means we’ll need to make all the lights on colorado boulevard plus skip the concession stand and preshow urination
oh dude i wish you had said something before i pounded that last red bull
hey we’re uh going to the movies
no we’re not we’re standing in the hallway suffering through an awkward encounter
hang on they’re showing a new digital print of time bandits you wouldn’t want to come would you
all right invitation pointlessly offered invitation declined as expected everyone’s civil nobody’s fighting have a nice evening
oh take all the time you need
so are we going to talk about last night
eeeeeh wrong answer but thank you for playing
oh come on this is stupid
oh there it is again you think i’m stupid
no there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid
oh yeah well there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass
yeah i don’t think i need my preshow urination anymore
leonard when that woman moved in three years ago i told you not to talk to her and now look we’re going to be late for the movies
remember this one spiderman loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him want me to get it for you it’ll help take your mind off things
oh we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of time bandits
oh well no problem i was thinking of closing early and going home but let’s face it that’s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books
thanks stuart let me ask you something do you think it’s okay for penny to have an exboyfriend sleep on her couch
no i mean she’s obviously way out of line
but if she dumps you she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one so the only question is how long until you fold
i am not going to fold
well excuse me i don’t think penny’s out of line at all you don’t own her it’s like my girl beyonce says if you like it you shoulda put a ring on it”
come on at the very least when she found out leonard was upset about it she should’ve backed off
you mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother
i didn’t know you were upset about that
really did you miss all the subtle indicators like me saying howard i am upset
maybe it means something different in this country back in india it means you’re upset with a guy named howard
sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that i had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy do you know what vegan chicken and rice is rice
yeah well you think i was having fun sitting around all night listening to my mother say “have you ever peed so much in your life”
oh my god you are such a mama’s boy
hey don’t bring my mother into this
you brought your mother into this
stop it both of you all this fighting i might as well be back with my parents damn it george i told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ i’d leave you well i guess that makes you a liar ’cause i’m drunk as hell and you’re still here stop yelling you’re making sheldon cry i’ll tell you what’s making sheldon cry that i let you name him sheldon
boy what got him so upset
oh sure you can tell when sheldon’s upset
oh thank you very much come back soon with the other half of my tip hey sheldon what are you doing here
this is a restaurant it’s lunchtime i would think as a waitress you’d be familiar with the paradigm
no i believe leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize
i assumed that would be your attitude hence my true purpose in coming here
i want you to crawl back to him and apologize
excuse me miss i’d like to order lunch
i have a few questions first i notice that you offer soup and a halfsandwich
where exactly does the halfsandwich come from are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich or do i have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half
no no sheldon they just make a halfsandwich
you can’t make a halfsandwich if it’s not half of a whole sandwich it’s just a small sandwich
okay fine it’s soup and a small sandwich is that what you want
of course not i’ll have my usual
aren’t you going to ask me if i want a beverage
yes i want you to apologize to leonard
i am not going to apologize i’ve done nothing wrong he is completely overreacting
irrelevant the disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable
well i’m sorry sheldon but this really isn’t about you
yeah yeah i’ll be right there look sheldon i have to go
all right let’s assume ad argumentum that in this case leonard is wrong
considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked don’t you think that just this once you could return the favour
i’m coming goodbye sheldon what do you mean transgressions i’ve committed
were you under the impression that leonard has no complaints about you
like what yeah yeah i see you you’re making a little cheque sign in the air i got it just hold your horses what does leonard complain about
your driving the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities your constant tardiness your singing
that’s actually from my list but leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it
okay if leonard has so many problems with me why hasn’t he just said so
because according to him you’re oversensitive and have a temper
oh really well then do me a favour and tell leonard that he can drop dead
and she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped
oh good you’re home i need you to do me a favour
although a few minutes ago would have been better
i hear you don’t like my stuffed animals my driving or my punctuality
what who would tell you something like that why would you tell her something like that
it doesn’t matter why he told me it’s true isn’t it
okay yeah it’s true but i can live with that stuff what i can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first
that isn’t even your problem the problem is you don’t trust me
oh come on sheldon have you ever once heard me say that i don’t trust penny sheldon where did he go
oh your yelling must have freaked him out again
where are you going you just walk away in the middle of an argument
no i’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something
oh now i need your permission for that too
well i can’t read your mind penny
really why not you’re so smart and i’m so dumb
knock knock knock raj knock knock knock raj knock knock knock raj
stop knocking it’s open please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture and i can’t come home for my cousin sanjay’s wedding
sheldon ask our son what we’re supposed to say to mr and mrs choudhry whose daughter lakshmi is flying in from london for the sole purpose of meeting him
i didn’t ask you to set me up with lakshmi
yes lakshmi just got her stomach stapled you have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight and her selfesteem goes up
i don’t care and why don’t you think i can find a woman for myself
because you’re 27 and the closest thing we have to a daughterinlaw is that jewish boy howard
oh that is completely below the belt sheldon tell my parents that howard and i are just friends sheldon howard and i are just friends fine i’ll come home for sanjay’s wedding
what are you doing he’s not a lost dog
hey why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake
the brake might be imaginary but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t
eyes on the road eyes on the road
howard answer the door i’m busy
i’m busy too you answer it
i can’t i’m on the toilet
for god’s sake i don’t need to hear that can’t you just say i’m busy
i said i’m busy but that wasn’t good enough for you
you know what i hope it’s one of those home invasion deals and they shoot me in the head
well if it’s a home invader don’t tell them i’m on the toilet
there’s no one there you’re hearing things you crazy old lady
hey stuart have you seen sheldon
yeah he’s uh over in the graphic novel section built himself a little nest
uh sheldon told me you and leonard were having a fight
oh yeah kind of it’s it’s no big thing
oh good good she moves away i love you
i’m not leaving until you talk to me
it’s a little hard to explain he does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in but he can’t perceive us
don’t flatter yourself i’m just ignoring you
come on sheldon let’s go home look we’re done fighting
i’ve heard that before but then the next thing you know i’m hiding in my bedroom blaring a richard feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf and my dad’s on the roof skeetshooting her franklin mint collectible plates
okay there’s going to no more shouting and no skeetshooting
really where’s your friend justin going to sleep
oh my god would you let this go
why should i let it go why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep sheldon turns on a loud toy robot oh for god’s sakes so you have childhood issues we all have childhood issues at some point you just need to grow up and get past them sheldon turns on another robot
leonard will you just let me handle this please look let’s just… sheldon please
always is a long time sure always
you know how about we buy you this robot and then we all go home
okay you can have that one
oh come on he’s just going to play with it twice and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk
can i get this comic book too
so what did justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch
he’s a musician he’ll sleep in his own vomit if he has to
i should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot
how much time do we have
uh tminus five hours 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower
okay our position is 3448 degrees north 11831 west that means the azimuth should be 16822 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 4993
uh we have a signal but there’s no frame lock
we did it we have the west coast feed of hbo
big deal every time i watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers
alright let’s see what’s on the east coast feed
not a great movie but look at that beautiful desert
too bad sheldon couldn’t come with us
yes it’s not the same without him they all laugh
oh this sucks i’m switching back to real sex
sheldon’s log stardate 633453 while my colleagues are off observing the leonid meteor shower i have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states although my research is going well i do miss the warmth of human companionship he laughs
and good evening to you siam palace this is sheldon cooper yeah i’m going to be dining alone this evening so i’ll be reducing my usual order i’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and uh one half of the golden treasure for two oh for heaven’s sake in the mid18th century king rama iv of siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of europe in order to preserve his throne surely you his cultural descendant can handle pad thai and dumplings
i need to go but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelpcom recently took down a local muffin store at penny’s door knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
at penny’s bedroom door knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
oh for god’s sakes i’m in the bathroom
shall i come back at a better time
get in here hurry don’t you dare knock
i slipped in the shower and i think i dislocated my shoulder
not surprising you have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction
i have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub
yeah okay whatever will you just turn the water off and help me up
they’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for nor the ability to use umbrellas
oh my god i got to go to the emergency room
well assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket i would certainly think so
well it seems we’ve reached an impasse
but i could call you a cab or an ambulance
no no no i can’t wait that long you got to help me please
all right let it never be said that sheldon lee cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress
no one’s saying that let’s go
well it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99cent adhesive ducks we both might die in a fiery car crash
i wish penny didn’t have to work she loves camping
yeah that would have been great you and penny having sex in the tent while i sit out here and watch howard hump a cactus
okay the best i can tell there are eight other campsites nearby mostly science nerds like us but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation
wow wonderful how old are they
oh i don’t know 50 55
come on you guys can’t be that hard up
look they gave me homemade cookies
of course they did that’s what grandmothers do
so what are we waiting for
relax i said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap
yeah very tasty well so tell me more about these teachers
not much to tell they had a vw microbus and were wearing tiedyed grateful dead shirts
i see no organizational system in here whatsoever which panties do you wear on mondays
i don’t need panties i just need shorts and a shirt
my mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident
one was already in an accident
that doesn’t mean one won’t be in another especially if i’m driving
seriously those shorts with that top
we should have you checked for a concussion
okay now you got to help me put these on
i don’t want you to see me naked
oh well that’s understandable you may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology uh lot and his wife perseus and medusa orpheus and eurydice
they always look it never ends well
ok now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve
it doesn’t feel like an arm
then maybe you should let it go
up above the world so high like little diamonds in the sky
that’s beautiful dude you should… you should write that down before someone steals it
so when do the meteors get here
the meteors don’t get here the earth is moving into their path
i can feel it i can feel the earth moving it’s moving too fast raj slow it down
it’s your american accent everything you say sounds stupid with an american accent stars are pretty aren’t they
for the record i should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle
you have your learner’s permit right
yes and i have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator
all right can we please go
one moment according to my driver’s ed book a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner there’s the handle oh no too far bringing it back optimized now where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror
where is the passenger side mirror
in a parking lot in hollywood now can we please go
yes as soon as i adjust my seat whee oh dear i’m going to have to start again
if i could speak the language of rabbits they would be amazed and i would be their king
i hate my name it has nerd in it len nerd
i lost my virginity to my cousin jeanie
i would be kind to my rabbit subjects at first
you know what’s a cool name angelo that has angel and jello in it
it was my uncle murray’s funeral we were all back at my aunt barbara’s house our eyes locked over the pickled herring we never meant for it to happen
one day i hold a great ball for the president of france but the rabbits they hate me and don’t come i am embarrassed so i eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch
people could call me angie yo angie how’s it goin’
to this day i can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed oh cousin jeanie
could you please drive a little faster
oh i think we’re going sufficiently fast what’s that
nothing the engine does that sometimes
that can’t be nothing the check engine light is on we need to find a service station
no the light has been on since i bought the car
all the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes
it’s not going to explode just keep driving warp speed ahead mr spock
mr spock did not pilot the enterprise he was the science officer and i guarantee you that if he ever saw the enterprise’s check engine light blinking he would pull the ship over immediately
oh god i’m gonna lose the arm
oh oh red light release accelerator and slowly apply the brake nailed it while we have a moment may i ask you a question
why do you have the chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock
no it isn’t but i suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup
how did you see it you said you wouldn’t look
sorry as i told you the hero always peeks
no that was the last pudding cup
that’s what he used to eat his pudding remember
right that was so good sweety and meaty at the same time
wait wait wait so you’re saying we’re out of food
the only thing in here are blue ice packs
i know they’re poison but they look like big yummy otter pops
oh god i am so hungry
me too check and see if we have any more pudding
all right there’s no need to bark at me according to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack but appears to be well enough to play doodle jump on his iphone we have to fill these out describe illness or injury
all right and how did the accident occur
cause of accident lack of adhesive ducks okay medical history have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes
are you sure you look a bit puffy
when was your last menstrual period
i’ll put in progress okay moving to psychiatric disorders list all major behavioural diagnoses eg depression anxiety etcetera
oh my god what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder
possible tourette’s all right moles lesions or other skin conditions soup tattoo on right buttock
hey sheldon sheldon look i am scared and in a lot of pain could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being i don’t know comforting
i’m sorry there there everything’s going to be fine sheldon’s here
will you shut up we’re all hungry
okay our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east easy target big doughy scout master couple of cubs most webelos
what kind of score are we looking at
hot dogs buns s’mores i mean it’s a freaking 711
oh my god could it be yes my mother put an i love you brisket in my backpack
you don’t need forks it’s so tender it falls apart in your hands
i feel like we’re forgetting something important
me too but what behind them the meteor shower has begun
maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots
now remember you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer so uh don’t operate heavy machinery try not to choke on your own drool
wait you have to help me get into bed sheldon has to get me into bed bet you never thought i’d say that
yes the charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds
you know people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time and you totally are but then it’s like that movie walle at the end you’re so full of love and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs
that’s a fairly laboured metaphor but i appreciate the sentiment behind it
“soft kitty” is for when you’re sick you’re not sick
injured and drugged is a kind of sick
soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur…
wait wait let’s sing it as a round i’ll start soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur… see that’s where you come in i’ll start over soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur… i’ve got all night sheldon soft kitty warm kitty… sheldon joins in with the round little ball of fur happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr
…and the next morning when he woke up he rolled over and realized… duhduhduh …she was his cousin
and she was my second cousin
and she was my second cousin
who cares you slept with your cousin
so two years later there’s a knock on the door guy opens it and there on his porch is the snail who says “what the heck was all that about”
well see it took two years for the snail to… she kisses him not important
can i ask you a question
where do you think this is going
to be honest i was hoping at least second base
you’re so funny you’re like a standup comedian
a jewish standup comedian that’d be new
actually i think a lot of them are jewish
no i was just… never mind
look howard this is our third date and we both know what that means
but i need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a onenight stand
okay just to be clear there’s only one correct answer right it’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane
maybe you need to think about it a little
you know it’s not unheard of for a onenight stand to turn into a relationship
call me when you figure it out
three dates means sex who knew
why are you back from your date so early
in romance as in show business always leave them wanting more
hey did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex
actually i’ve never had three dates with the same woman
with penny and me it took two years now that i think about it that was three dates
okay well before you and penny hooked up did she ask for any kind of commitment
no she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open
i have something to announce but out of respect for convention i will wait for you to finish your current conversation what are you talking about
the cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates
i see now are we talking date the social interaction or date the dried fruit
oh good my turn well this is very exciting and i wanted you to be among the first to know…
hey cooper i hear you’re going to be on the wadio with ira fwatow from science fwiday next week
thank you kripke for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends
my thank you was not sincere
but my pweasure is let me ask you a question at what point did national public wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests eh don’t answer it’s wetowical
why are you such a stupid head that is also rhetorical i’m sorry you had to hear that
are you really going to be on npr
yes they’re interviewing me by phone from my office regarding the recent socalled discovery of magnetic monopoles in spinices it’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy
thank you my mother is very excited she’s convening her bible study group to listen in and then pray for my soul
i was on the radio once i called in to fever 104 fm new delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays “fever 104 आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर” that means
all right these are the talking points for my npr interview tomorrow i need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand howard look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you
excuse me i have a master’s degree in engineering from the massachusetts institute of technology it required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis
yes look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you
you know when sheldon gives you homework you don’t have to do it
in fact it’s better if you don’t otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad
yo raj talk to me i’m sorry just screwing with you hey howard why haven’t you called bernadette
yeah she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week i thought you liked her
i do yeah but she wants a commitment and i’m not sure she’s my type
she agreed to go out with you for free what more do you need
look bernadette is really nice i just always thought when i finally settle down into a relationship it would be with someone you know different
well you know more like megan fox from transformers or katee sackhoff from battlestar galactica
you’d have a better shot with the threebreasted martian hooker from total recall
okay now you’re just being unrealistic anyway that movie was like 20 years ago imagine how saggy those things would be
howard you’re going to throw away a great girl like bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy
hey just because you settled doesn’t mean i have to
hey i did not settle for leonard i mean obviously he isn’t the kind of guy i usually go out with you know physically
my point is i do not judge a book by its cover i am interested in the person underneath
i am here right you see me
hey i’m interested in what’s inside people too but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in say the delicious caramel that is halle berry to raj yes you’re delicious caramel too
all right you know what i will tell you why it’s wrong…
biologically speaking howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line
now whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is of course an entirely different question
oh this is going to be a wiot
now let’s talk about magnetic monopoles can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is
of course first consider an ordinary magnet which has the pitch of his voice begins to rise as even the most uneducated in your audience must know two poles pitch rises further a north and south pole if you cut that in half you have two smaller magnets each with its own north and south pole
uh dr cooper i think there might be something wrong with our connection
no i hear you fine as i was saying an ordinary magnet has two poles the primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole hence monopole
a requirement for string theory or mtheory if you will is the existence of such monopoles i myself led an expedition to the arctic circle in search of said particles kripke i found the nozzle i’m going to kill you
so nice you could join me this evening you’re looking lovely as always
thanks howard always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies
come on katee don’t make it sound so cheap
i’m sorry fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act
thank you so shall we get started
sure but can i ask you a question first
you want to play cylon and colonist
no i want to know why you’re playing makebelieve with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight
no i mean princess leia of course i mean bernadette she’s a wonderful girl and she really likes you
i know but she’s not you
i’m not me the real me is in beverly hills going out with a tall handsome rich guy
the point is you’ve got a wonderful girl in your life and you’re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth
howard what are you doing in there
i hope that’s all you’re doing we share that tub
don’t remind me katee has vanished oh man all soaped up and no place to go
i was humiliated on national radio how do you think i’m doing
come on it wasn’t that bad
we represent the lollipop guild and we want you
okay so kripke played a joke on you
i fell on the floor all right he got you you can get him back
i refuse to sink to his level
you can’t sink with all that helium in you you’re lucky you don’t float away
however on an unrelated topic i am never getting out of this bed again
what if you could make kripke look even sillier than he made you look
i don’t think that’s possible dude
i didn’t come to help i came to mock
sheldon what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on kripke like uh like how the joker got back at batman for putting him in the arkham asylum for the criminally insane
that’s true he didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains he he broke out and poisoned gotham’s water supply
well i suppose i could poison kripke
it’s a simple matter there are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy
okay uh that’s the spirit but um let’s dial it back to a nonlethal form of vengeance
oh how about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair he’ll sit down it’ll sound like he’s flatulent even though he’s not
oh gee you’re too late scarlett johansson and wonder woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic little weasels
yeah i came to talk to bernadette she’s working today right
yes but i don’t think she wants to see you
come on howard you hurt her feelings by not calling her all week plus i’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya
wait bernadette i need to talk to you
this will only take a second you asked me to think about where our relationship was going and i did bernadette will you marry me
is this more comedy that i don’t understand
no i’m serious i’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is you know real
i prefer to think of myself as quirky
howard we’ve only been on three dates we haven’t even had sex yet
don’t you just hate when this happens
all right how’s this for revenge a solution of hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide
mountain dew ah refreshing now we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap creating a little exothermic release of oxygen
this is brilliant sheldon how are we going to deploy it in kripke’s office
already taken care of observe this is a live shot of kripke’s lab via a mini webcam i was able to install thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket at the same time i also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling
oh sheldon you remind me of a young lex luthor
the reaction will be triggered when kripke reaches the center of the room mwah ha ha
i gotta say i am really impressed this is truly the sheldon cooper way to get even sits down there is a flatulent noise
it may be lowtech but i still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity
i believe that’s the president of the university
and the board of directors abort abort
well how could you not put in an abort
i made a booboo all right
i think the board will weally appweciate how well we’re using that nsa gwant pwesident seibert wight here we have a micwocontwolled pwasma… foam falls from the ceiling soaking everyone
wow looks like the ganges on laundry day
at least they don’t know it was you
hello kripke this classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of sheldon cooper if you’d like to see the look on your stupid face this video is being instantly uploaded to youtube oh and a hat tip to leonard hofstadter and raj koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise
well i’m going back to india what’s your plan
hey here’s your tip from table seven
you want me to throw him out
are you sure he’s small i bet i can get a nice tight spiral on him
i want to dedicate this number to a great gal who i’ve done wrong to the tune of the four tops song bernadette  bernadette i am so sorry for trying to propose to you bernadette you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing i do i know now it was too soon to talk of love it was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub but bernadette give me one more chance sweet bernadette i’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance sweet bernadette i dream to once again kiss your lips sweet bernadette sincerely yours howard wolowitz bernadette…
are you kidding that’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me
hey leonard check this out throws some food in the air and catches it in her mouth
i think it upsets sheldon when you play with the food
no it upsets sheldon when she willynilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution this is essentially why you have famine in india
you want me to put it back
it upsets sheldon when you play with the sheldon
what’s up my nerdizzles raj sheldon i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette
leonard penny you know my girlfriend bernadette
bernadette say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles
i don’t think i can i don’t have howard’s street cred
i hope it’s all right i told my girlfriend bernadette she could join us for dinner
wait no that’s a false equivalency more does not equal merry if there were 2000 people in this apartment right now would we be celebrating no we’d be suffocating
don’t sheldon me we ordered for five people not six
oh come on it’s fine we’ll just put it all on the table you know family style
oh sure and while we’re at it why don’t we put our hands behind our backs have an oldfashioned eating contest
relax it’ll be fine sit down you guys
oh yeah you can’t sit there
oh no no you see in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm yet not so close that he sweats in the summer it’s directly in the path of a crossbreeze created by opening windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct so he can still talk to everybody yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted
perhaps there’s hope for you after all
oh thanks they are cute aren’t they
i’ve been meaning to go over there
my mother was right hell is real
come on sheldon let the womenfolk chat
don’t take him too seriously a lot of what he says is intended as humour
yeah well i don’t think it’s very funny
me neither but he just lights up when i laugh
so leonard howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics
i am are you interested in physics
oh i find it fascinating if i hadn’t gone into microbiology i probably would have gone into physics or ice dancing
actually my tests of the aharonovbohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point right now we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential
yes leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels raj whispers to him while i appreciate the oh snap i’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear
are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions
yes i am you want to see a simulation on my laptop
oh yeah show me in microbiology the most exciting thing i get to work with is yeast
your shoes are delightful where did you get them
ha eat my dust racially stereotypical plumber
that’s not fair i got stuck behind a tree
and a cow and a penguin face it dude whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car you can’t drive
just need a little more practice
what you need is cheat codes motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at mario kart
hey sheldon can i talk to you for a second
it’s not about shoes is it i don’t think i could go through that again
um actually can we do it in private
all right to raj go away i agree it’s rude but she asked for privacy
thanks raj okay so here’s the thing i was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics
a little physics there’s no such thing physics encompasses the entire universe from quantum particles to supernovas from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies
yeah okay cool i don’t need the pbs special i just want to know enough so i can talk to leonard about his job you know like bernadette does
‘cause i want to surprise him
can’t you surprise him in some other way for example i’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment
come on sheldon this is important to me
penny this would be a massive undertaking and my time is both limited and valuable
you’re sitting here playing video games all day
okay point what sort of foundation do you have did you take any science classes in school
sure i did the one with the frogs
yeah actually it was pretty cool a lot of the girls threw up but i gutted that thing like a deer
i’m sorry penny i don’t think so
oh come on a smart guy like you it’ll be a challenge you can make it like an experiment
interesting i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla i could teach you some rudimentary physics
great it’s a little insulting but great i’ll be koko
not likely koko learned to understand over 2000 words not one of which had anything to do with shoes
hey fellas this is my girlfriend bernadette my girlfriend bernadette
hey look it’s howard and his girlfriend bernadette
thought i’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines
he doesn’t mean salt mines he means where he works
ah terrific we’re getting the electron accelerator set up we should be ready to go day after tomorrow
boy i’d love to see that
really oh that’d be great how exciting is that
oh you got me again this isn’t nonfat yogurt this is fatty fat fat excuse me
could you grab me another napkin sweetie
thanks honey she goes all right what is your deal
inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator
wow you really are a piece of work it’s not enough you get the prom queen you have to get the head of the decorating committee too
don’t play innocent with me i practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women
not so far but that’s not the point
howard relax i’m not interested in your girlfriend
i hope not because you don’t want to mess with me i’m crazy
research journal entry one i’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career teaching penny physics i’m calling it project gorilla
come in take a seat subject has arrived i’ve extended a friendly casual greeting
one moment subject appears wellrested and enthusiastic apparently ignorance is bliss all right let us begin where’s your notebook
how are you going to take notes without a notebook
how else are you gonna study for the tests
tests here it’s collegeruled i hope that’s not too intimidating
you’re welcome now introduction to physics what is physics physics comes from the ancient greek word physika it’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes physika means the science of natural things and it is there in ancient greece that our story begins
hush if you have questions raise your hand it’s a warm summer evening circa 600 bc you’ve finished your shopping at the local market or agora and you look up at the night sky there you notice some of the stars seem to move so you name them planetes or wanderer yes penny
um does this have anything to do with leonard’s work
this is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient greeks through isaac newton to niels bohr to erwin schrodinger to the dutch researchers that leonard is currently ripping off
yeah give or take as i was saying it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece… yes penny
i have to go to the bathroom
not for twenty six hundred years
project gorilla entry two i am exhausted
senior fitness was cancelled it turns out you can forget how to ride a bike i’m fine but oy did sam harpootian eat gravel
what’s great about an 80yearold armenian man with half his chin scraped off
no no don’t move hey ma can i have lamb stew for dinner
lamb stew i’d have to go to the supermarket
please i got a real hankering
oh i can’t say no to my little tushy face i’ll be back soon
do you want the regular peas or the le seur
always le seur peas with lamb stew
you’re right when you’re right you’re right what if they’re out of the le seur
all right you don’t have to yell
let me just put that on vibrate
you know that one i got howard did you say something to leonard about me
he says if i go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out
you’re not jealous of leonard are you
me no i may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man
are you saying i need to ask your permission to hang out with leonard
i didn’t say anything like that i said leonard has to ask my permission bernadette storms out come on i don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother damn i was this close on the bra
now remember newton realized that aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion so let’s plug in our 98 meters per second squared as a and we get force earth gravity equals mass times 98 meters per second per second so we can see that ma equals mg and what do we know from this
uh we know that… newton was a really smart cookie oh is that where fig newtons come from
no fig newtons are named after a small town in massachusetts don’t write that down
now if ma equals mg what does that imply
how can you not know i just told you have you suffered a recent blow to the head
hey you don’t have to be so mean
i’m sorry smiling have you suffered a recent blow to the head
no you just suck at teaching
really of those two explanations which one seems the most likely
oh god sheldon look i’m trying to understand but you’re going too fast can you just back up a little bit
all right it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece…
okay at what point did you begin to feel lost
i don’t know where were we looking up at the night sky
there’s no need to get frustrated people learn at different rates unlike objects falling in a vacuum which… ma equals mg
that’s no reason to cry one cries because one is sad for example i cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad
okay look can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what leonard does
all right leonard is attempting to learn why subatomic particles move the way they do
really that’s it well that doesn’t sound so complicated
it’s not that’s why leonard does it
okay i just have one question what exactly are subatomic particles
and to answer it we first must ask ourselves what is physics
it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece…
okay i got a bone to pick with you
i was in bed with bernadette and you textblocked me
we were completely naked about to devour each other when you text her that i have a problem with her hanging out with you
you do have a problem with her hanging out with me
yeah but that’s not what you tell her
what was i supposed to tell her
i don’t know something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty jealous douche
come on do i have to think of everything
hey leonard am i too late to see the experiment oh hi
same thing you’re doing here i came to see leonard’s experiment
no you didn’t you said leonard’s experiment was stupid
you told her my experiment was stupid
i was just repeating what sheldon said let’s not get off topic bernadette i need to apologize i was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with
should i um leave you two alone
no leonard you should hear this
okay good ’cause i wasn’t really gonna go
look i know i come off as confident and worldly but the truth is i’m not
which is why i tend to feel threatened by other guys
or loud noises clowns and nuns
but i now realize how foolish that is
he had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater
it was a full turtleneck why aren’t you helping me
i don’t know maybe because i’m crazy
bernadette please i’m asking you to give me another chance
what do you think leonard should i give him another chance
it’s up to you he didn’t call your experiment stupid
tushy face that is going on twitter right now
raj you should’ve seen leonard’s experiment the interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on
i’m glad you enjoyed it most people aren’t that interested in what i do
actually that’s not true leonard in fact recently i’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment the transport of electrons through the aperture the nanofabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the netherlands their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the aharonovbohm quantuminterference effect that’s it that’s all i know oh wait fig newtons were named after a town in massachusetts not the scientist
oh i always tear up when the grinch’s heart grows three sizes
tears seem appropriate enlargement of the heart muscle or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure
you really didn’t like it sheldon
no on the contrary i found the grinch to be a relatable engaging character and i was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved christmas what a buzz kill that was
when we watch frosty the snowman he roots for the sun
excuse me but the sun is essential for all life on earth frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat a crime by the way for which he is never brought to account
i just love decorating the christmas tree it makes me feel like a little girl again
we didn’t have a tree when i was growing up
mmm in my family holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society
oh sounds festive did you at least give presents
mmm in a way we presented papers and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other
sheldon what about you did you have a christmas tree
oh yes we had a tree we had a manger we had an inflatable santa claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn and to make things even more jolly there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhoodwide seizures
so i take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree
i do not but if you insist on decorating a spiderinfested fire hazard in my home i would request that you add this
you’re kidding right it’s a bust of sir isaac newton
oh sure sure yeah very christmassy
wait excuse me but it’s much more christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree
december 25 1642 julian calendar sir isaac newton is born jesus on the other hand was actually born in the summer his birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats which frankly sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake
i sense that’s not sincere although i have no idea why
no it’s fine look sir isaac can go right next to this little candy cane
no isaac goes at the top of the tree
i understand you dispute newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put gottfried leibniz on the top
yeah you got me i’m a leibniz man
well perhaps when your mother gets here she’ll talk some sense into you
what your… your mother’s coming when
when were you going to tell me
why were you keeping this a secret
if i can interject here obviously leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate
why wouldn’t she approve of me i’m adorable
if i can interject again leonard comes from a remarkably highachieving family who have all chosen highachieving partners he probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the cheesecake factory menu
hey it’s a big menu there’s two pages just for desserts
i know and those specials they change every day
okay you know what it’s lame when i say it it’s just ridiculous when you pile on
so what did she say when you told her we were going out
you didn’t tell her we were going out did you
leonard i’m no expert on meditation but if you’re trying to calm yourself down i believe the word is om
it was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up
i drove mother i’m driving now
yes dear mommy’s proud i’ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory
my pleasure for a nonphysicist you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a bose condensate
wait wait wait when did you send my mom notes on a paper
august 16th right after her carpal tunnel surgery
oh did i thank you for the flowers
neither do i but it’s the social convention
wait wait wait you had surgery
yes and sheldon sent me flowers
then what was all that wait wait wait about
i just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than i do
well i would assume it’s because sheldon and i stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect while you avoid me due to unresolved childhood issues
it’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder we discussed it at length during our last video chat although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling
yes but we are on the subject so i’m obliged to ask leonard how are you
have you heard your brother has gotten engaged
no sheldon why didn’t you tell me
my bad i did send a gift from both of us
she’s a remarkable girl the youngest appeals court judge in new jersey and a twotime olympic bronze medallist
why i’m not marrying her so how about you are you seeing anyone interesting
well i’m not sure about interesting but…
very well shall we switch topics to isaac newton v gottfried leibniz
it’s all right sheldon i will just pretend that leonard’s not withholding information although i will point out leonard that i am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate
isn’t she brilliant leonard how i envy you
so howard have you and rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another
because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another
no really i have a girlfriend now
and where is she this evening
she had to go out of town her grandmother died
honest to god leonard tell her i have a girlfriend
i don’t know what you’re talking about
what do you mean you don’t know what i’m talking about tell her i have a girlfriend
all right he “has” a “girlfriend”
her name is bernadette she’s working as a waitress but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist
howard keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct the more you’re hurting your partner
do you really think your lips in my ear is helping
oh glad you’re here uh sit down i’ll get you a plate mom you remember penny
oh yes the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts
well he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for christmas so i’m going to say no
if it helps we’re all good with your breasts
classic overcompensation oh speaking of fathers leonard that reminds me i’m divorcing yours
yes he was cheating on me
yes with some waitress from the university cafeteria can you believe it a waitress oh no offense dear
no it sounded like a compliment
mmm well let’s see sheldon when did i leave leonard’s father
oh yes that’s right the weekend after leonard’s dog died
she was old and blind leonard what choice did we have
i don’t believe this why am i the last to know
excuse me leonard i am the one who’s getting a divorce mitzy is the one who is dead why are you the one making a fuss
you’re right i’mi’mi’mi’m sorry i’m way out of line
so penny what’s new in your life
thank you for driving me back to my hotel
i was going to ask leonard to do it but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don’t want someone like that operating heavy machinery
your check engine light is on
yeah i gotta put a sticker over that so uh you must be devastated about your divorce
oh not at all but i am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that’s not subjected to regular maintenance
come on i mean you’re not upset that your marriage is over
well initially i felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger but that’s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch
thankfully my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that i haven’t had intercourse with him in eight years
oh that’s nothing i’ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982
that’s exactly what i say during orgasms yikes
you know what i could use a drink do you want to stop for a drink
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
i didn’t make tea for you this is my tea
then why are you telling me
oh is it we’re conversing checkmate
what i want is to be departing the starship enterprise in a oneman shuttle craft headed to the planetoid i rule known as sheldon alpha five
i want that too why are you here
to comfort you of course no that’s not going to work at all i’ll comfort you from over here leonard what you’re experiencing is a classic jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the nevertobe realized ideal family unit
no no the comforting part is that the germans have a term for what you’re feeling weltschmerz it means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical idealized world
you’re right i do feel better
well the germans have always been a comforting people just remember leonard where your biological family has failed you you always have me your surrogate family
if it’s any consolation i’m not happy about it either good night
okay now this time try drinking it all at once
i’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003 another round for me and my homegirl
i feel a spreading warmth through my extremities
as long as you don’t feel it running down your pants you’re fine
oh that is fascinating i’m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions for example i’m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while i eat cheesecake what do you think
well we are known for our cheesecake hit us again
yes if a little is good more must be better
the one from whom i live across the hall from
well that’s convenient how did his penis turn out
oh beverly i can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis
oh fair enough what can you tell me if anything about that busboy’s penis
actually i’ve only had the cheesecake one more time you know leonard did not want to tell you we were dating
really well that means he’s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn’t care enough about his mother to tell her he’s in one either way one of us should be insulted
well let’s go find out who
you go get a taxi i’m gonna slip my business card into that busboy’s back pocket cupping his firm right buttock as i do so
get out here your mommy wants to talk to you
what the hell is going on
why didn’t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl did i say that right
well i hope so otherwise why would we have stopped at del taco now how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely charming young woman
you’re welcome is it because she’s uneducated trapped in a menial service position
what the hell happened to lovely and charming
how come you didn’t tell me that you and father were getting a divorce how come you didn’t tell me you had surgery how come you didn’t tell me my dog died
wait wait wait wait wait what i hear you saying is that you want a more intimate motherson relationship
there it’s late now go to bed i’m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart
why is leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door
speaking of warm feelings come here she grabs sheldon and kisses him no i’d rather have the busboy
thank you for taking me to the airport
once again i’m driving i’m right here
please i am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval sheldon i do hope you’ll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night
i don’t blame you you were intoxicated
i blame penny too bad penny
wait a minute what are you talking about what inappropriate behaviour
i think it’s best that you not know
and i want you to take very good care of this young woman
you’re welcome she doesn’t have much in the way of career prospects don’t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well
mother remember when i was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough
look at us getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends
yes actual women are the best
i don’t understand what other kind of women are there
howard artificial women are your department you want to take this
no it would just freak him out listen before we leave i should warn you i’m a passionate man and i tend towards public displays of affection
what are you trying to tell me howard
there might be some making out in the car or the restaurant and i don’t want bernadette to feel uncomfortable so it would help if you and penny made out too
don’t worry we’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar
namaste white people good news i rented us the fourhour edition of watchmen
well then what are we going to do tonight
uh sorry raj howard and i are going out to dinner with penny and bernadette
yeah no more carefree bachelor nights for me and leonard these broncos have been saddled
how did we get actual women
great they get girlfriends and they just abandon us
it is great isn’t it we have a wonderful evening ahead of us
oh yes i just discovered i don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a linux partition so you and i are going to perform a full backup reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems
i don’t want to do that
all right well i’m going to perform full backup reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems
well i understand there are several types of artificial women maybe you should look into that
dude there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight look at the glendale galleria put on your best zoot suit it’s a salute to swing music in the center court near macy’s 5pm to 9pm huh huh a salute to zoot sounds like a hoot
i’m sorry raj i have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s
oh i always thought that was some sort of afterchristmas sale well then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around
i don’t need anything at the galleria do you need anything at the galleria
no we would just walk around and see what’s what
okay well how about this from the university web site 7pm to 10pm norton hall multipurpose room mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments whether you split atoms or infinitives this is the place to be
well that’s certainly amusing but i have no interest
come on sheldon the world is filled with people doing things outside let’s go outside outside is good
if outside is so good why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside
i don’t know it’s a marketing scheme please sheldon i’m a young virile visitor from a foreign land and i need to strut my stuff
let me offer you a compromise sometimes when i feel stifled and want a change of scenery i use my imagination
one of my favourite places to visit is the twodimensional world described in edwin abbott’s mathematical fantasy flatland
i don’t want to go to flatland
you’re only saying that because you haven’t been there i am now a hexagon in twodimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects
is that you raj i don’t recognize your edge
sheldon i’m begging you i want to go to this mixer and i don’t want to go alone
well you’re in luck there’s a mixer here in flatland oh look there’s a sexually attractive line segment you should chat her up
tell her you’re a circle flatland gals are all hot for circles
i hope you’re hungry bernadette we’re going to a terrific restaurant
oh yeah i’m starved when you spend all day in a biolab watching flesheating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite
flesheating bacteria and yet i still want to kiss this woman what does that tell you
that you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the offchance you’d get to second base
oh we’re way past second base right howard
well we kind of disagree about what the bases are
how’s your work going penny any acting jobs
well the last big thing i did was this production of diary of anne frank above a bowling alley but i think things might be turning around pretty soon
well promise you won’t make fun of me
of course i would never make fun of you
okay well i went to this psychic who told me that if i cut my hair i’m going to get a national commercial
seriously you’re getting career advice from a psychic
good job not making fun of her
she’s not one of those phonies okay she wrote a book and has her own web site
oh gee why didn’t you say so they don’t let just anyone have a web site
why are you being such a jerk
you’re surprised your psychic didn’t tell you i was going to be a jerk
why don’t you kids go ahead and chat we’re gonna make out back here
thanks for giving me your limited edition green lantern lantern
did you really have to bring it in with you
what if evil strikes and my power ring runs low
come on let’s get a drink
yeah well i do and when my wingman is carrying a green lantern lantern i drink a lot i’ll have a screwdriver please don’t be chintzy with the screw
i would like a root beer float
sheldon they don’t have ice cream
they don’t well apparently these people and i differ greatly on the definition of party
and don’t be chintzy with the shirley
okay let’s check out the females
that’s professor wilkinson’s wife she’s like 80 years old
but she’s female isn’t that the game
no i’m looking for a hookup
oh yes so the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with
not so loud but ideally yes thanks
thank you and what is my function as wingman
you help me run my game
when i lie through my teeth to a woman you nod and agree
hey that’s pretty cool what is it
it’s a limited edition green lantern lantern my friend is looking for someone to copulate with
i’m sheldon how do you do
how do you do rajesh ramayan koothrappali call me raj
hi raj where are you from
i thought your father was a gynaecologist i’m sorry smiles and nods
martha come here meet raj and sheldon this is my friend martha
is that the limited edition green lantern lantern
in brightest day in darkest night no evil shall escape my sight
thank you have you chosen one to copulate with
so what should we talk about
well we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots leonard
oh we don’t need to talk about that anymore leonard covered it pretty well in the car
i’m sorry but facts are facts
right and if you can’t understand it it’s not a fact
no if it’s not a fact it’s not a fact
oh got it thank you for educating me
amazing would you like to try some
well the fact is you can’t
come on howard bernadette you’re both scientists help me out here
what do you think want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument
maybe we should just stop talking about this
maybe some of us should stop talking altogether
you know the best thing about being in a committed monogamous mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas you can have a spirited debate yet still care for even make love with… she shuts the door in his face want your fish opens door takes fish closes it again i knew you were going to do that doesn’t make me psychic attaboy leonard make it worse opens his own apartment door to find sheldon raj and the two girls playing rock band and performing american woman
had a great night last night i don’t like to kiss and tell but somebody made it to eighth base
what the hell is eighth base
seventh base with shirt off well my shirt how’d things go with penny
are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent cylons
it’s not just cylons superman’s next
all right i was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch but i can come back later when you don’t have a highpowered weapon
how can i go out with a woman who believes in psychics
hey i once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens
au contraire it meant she was gullible and open to a little probing
what am i supposed to do pretend i believe something i don’t whenever i’m with penny
hey i’m sure penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you
do me a favour lean over put your head right here
let me show you another way to look at this here we have the universe of all women these are the ones you want to sleep with these are the women who believe exactly what you believe these are the women who would be willing to sleep with you and right there in the
what’s your point in order to keep having a sexual relationship with penny i have to give up everything i believe in my intellectual integrity the very nature of who i am i can’t do that howard
i respect that takes leonard’s hand draws a dot on it

जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई that’s hindi for whatever floats your boat uh listen i got a text from that girl abby and she and her friend martha want to hang out with us again what do you say
i don’t say anything i merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane
i don’t get it you had a great time
yes exactly i had a great time that’s done i’ve moved on to other things for example after i learn finnish i’m not going to learn finnish again
please sheldon i’m a lost indian boy far from home and i want a girlfriend and i want her to be abby and she’ll only come over if she can bring martha
raj i highly doubt there is any argument you can make threat you might levy rhetorical strategy plea invocation supplication or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider
my incredible hulk hands signed by stan lee
oh my i’ve admired these for years
so does that mean we can go with the girls again
hulk agree to second date with puny humans
you can’t wear the hands on the date
hey cleaning out the old dryer lint huh not only is it courteous it’s safety smart every year 15000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition now you’re supposed to say wow what an interesting fact come here you crazy nerdy guy i could never be mad at you
wow that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included howard wolowitz
no i’m sorry i really am it’s not right to mock what a person believes in
thank you would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about
would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds
okay let’s go see your psychic
well yeah one of us has to keep an open mind
you saying i don’t have an open mind
no not at all let me help you with this stuff
you know i believe in ghosts too
i know and pyramid power and healing crystals
oh no no no crystals don’t work
really that’s the line psychics are real but crystals are voodoo
oh voodoo’s real you don’t want to mess with voodoo
flatland is more than just a mathematical essay it is also a treatise on victorian social mores
you know i had never considered that wow that’s going to completely change my visits there well it’s late
good night puny human he gets up and leaves
listen they’re kind of getting busy in the living room and i was wondering if i could hang out in here for a while
well i suppose come in i’ll sleep in leonard’s room good night
boy seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat you know just the guys
oh god yes we get it you have a girlfriend now
no i’m not jealous all right i’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid now can we order
oh dear lord they redid the menu
so what it’s the same food
oh is it look at this general tso’s chicken is no longer listed under specialties it’s now under chicken
not tso the chicken so the question so
so why is it no longer a specialty did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself and look over here shrimp in mobster sauce what is mobster sauce
perhaps perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime for all we know the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters
no no no no i think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like
it doesn’t mean any of that it’s a typo
you know what let’s just get a pizza
good idea we’ll go to corleone’s
you know the more i think about it the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster
what if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes
leonard are we having a serious conversation or not
oh god oh god oh god it’s all right they didn’t take my comic books
they took our tv two laptops four external harddrives our ps2 our ps3 our xbox our xbox 360 our classic nintendo our super nintendo our nintendo 64 and our wii
right games they took halo 1 halo 2 halo 3 call of duty 1 call of duty 2 call of duty 3 rock band rock band 2 final fantasy 1 thru 9 the legend of zelda the legend of zelda
when does the csi team get here
in anticipation of their arrival i’ve bagged some evidence one of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home you should be able to pull some good prints off this and now here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect
i’m sorry leonard it’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job
would i be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him
i’d be happy to put him under a 72hour psychiatric hold
i’m not crazy my mother had me tested
we’re done here call this number and we’ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company
i’m sorry that’s the end of your inquiry
do you have any more information that might be relevant
oh my goodness where do i begin for instance my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem
how is that going to help them
well they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months if so the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop
good night fellas come on bochco
what are we supposed to do now
the only thing we can do watch tv on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep
does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect
oh how i wish i could
i do not have to urinate i am the master of my own bladder drat
i can’t believe it if i hadn’t been working the dinner shift i would’ve run
hey there’s no reason for you to be scared
i’m not scared i would’ve gone all nebraska on their asses
knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny
we just had a major crime in the building and you open the door without asking who it is

knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny
yes we are and we’re about to go to bed
sheldon do you want to sleep here tonight
oh as small as leonard is i don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch
it’s not what i want it’s what evolution wants human beings are primates primates have evolved to live in groups both for protection and support
but you don’t like other people
i do tonight it’s scary over there
um… three little kittens three little pigs god i don’t know star wars
did we win can we go to bed
good lord i could not have made this easier hydrogen atom h plus pigs minus pea higgs bow general zod trapped in the phantom zone bowzone pear tickle peartickle higgs boson particle how could you not get that
he’s right penny it’s all there
look sheldon sweetie i know you’re feeling insecure but we’ve really got to go to sleep
all right i’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400
just keep walking sheldon checks door then puts tv on his phone
just gonna take a look around outside
no jim don’t open the door
don’t worry there’s no one out here sound of woman screaming sheldon nods and turns off tv walks down to leonard’s room
knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny
all right we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a stateoftheart electronic access system
what if they cut the power
there’s a 200watt uninterruptible backup power supply
what if someone steals my keys
there are independent voice and fingerprint scanners
what if someone kidnaps me forces me to record my voice and then cuts off my thumb
i’ll send them a basket of muffins
now inside we’ve got motion detectors infrared sensors and cameras connected to a server running stateoftheart facial recognition software
where did you get all this stuff
i got a buddy over at the department of defence
he just gave it to you
i’m sure he would have if i had asked ironically their security isn’t all that good
raj your car is blocking me… a wire net falls on her while a computer voice repeats the words “intruder alert” what the hell
wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna
don’t worry the net’s going to be electrified picture her on the floor spasming uncontrollably
sheldon’s journal security system in place however sleep continues to elude me i’ve seen the underbelly of pasadena this socalled city of roses and it haunts me ah the injustice i lie here awake tormented while out there evil lurks probably playing donkey kong on my classic nintendo hears a noise goes to check then panics and climbs out window onto ledge oh dear i am the master of my own bladder crawls along to leonard’s window where leonard and penny are inside being intimate knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny
god sheldon what the hell are you doing out there
it was us we knocked over a lamp
why would you knock over a lamp
he doesn’t need to know what we were doing leonard
oh no she’s right i don’t need to know what you were doing carry on starts to climb back out of window
what are you doing use the door
good thinking perhaps i’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk
would you like me to bring you some warm milk
and you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises very thoughtful warm milk penny
fine good night to you sir miss
ugh what can you do here from outside there is the sound of the net falling and computer voice saying “intruder alert” then sheldon screaming they run out to find sheldon convulsing under the net
looks like wolowitz got the net electrified
i’m fine although i’m no longer the master of my own bladder
my new computer came with windows 7 windows 7 is much more userfriendly than windows vista i don’t like that
don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction
our apartment was broken into our security system tried to kill me and as a result i’m leaving pasadena forever tell me how that’s overreacting
come on sheldon you can’t move don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns
oh if that were only true unfortunately as i’m earthbound for the foreseeable future i need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of pasadena like enid oklahoma low crime rate and highspeed internet connectivity but no model train shops sorry enid
is he quitting his job at the university
oh no he’s going to telecommute everybody’s really excited about it
all right boone north carolina every summer since 1952 boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake dan’l boone sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd penny you’re from nebraska correct
born and raised sheldon crosses nebraska off his map
it will take me a few days to get settled after i do i will email you detailed pdfs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to bozeman montana in the meantime please forward my mail
any place specific or just the bozeman montana loony bin
i sense you’re making a joke but bozeman does have a comedy club called the loony bin so do not forward my mail there
oh come on so you were the victim of a crime that’s part of life when my greatgrandfather first came to this country he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the lower east side of new york you know what happened every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver got ripped off but those people moved on and so should you
i am moving on i’m going to be a bozite
they should it’s one of the first things i plan to bring up upon arrival
sheldon i can’t believe i’m saying this but i’m going to miss you
please penny as you know i’m not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and maudlin displays of emotion so i prepared a short video
sheldon that’s so… turns to find he has gone
you might want to lock the door behind me this isn’t bozeman
how the hell do i know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance
that is a bracing cold an invigorating cold lord is it cold
help you with your bags sir
thank you fellow bozite and may i say you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s chamber of commerce man picks up bags and starts running wait wait excuse me at ticket desk one ticket to pasadena california please
interesting the acquaintance is the first to greet me
i’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain
interesting i usually just have coffee you’ve been up all night
then i’ve been up all night
why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus
oh sorry sweetie i can’t help you till i’ve had my coffee
penny i told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment
mmm he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after peter pan cut it off
captain hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile not an alligator if you’re going to mock me at least get your facts straight
i can’t see it it just won’t coalesce
maybe you need a fresh start
you’re right takes whiteboard to window and throws it out picks up a new one it’s a great idea leonard thank you
electrons move through graphene act as if they have no mass…
how long has he been stuck
intellectually about 30 hours emotionally about 29 years
unit cell contains two carbon atoms interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees
no i think it’s a firmware problem
hey it’s disco night at the moonlight roller rink in glendale tonight who’s up for getting down
oh that’s perfect bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating
i think penny likes to skate the four of us could double
what could be better we’re in
great it’s not like i brought it up because i wanted to go
no it’s okay i don’t have to go i’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices i’m a walking brown yelpcom
boy he’s really gone isn’t he
yeah this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant
pattern is the same as fermions travels on the pathways hexagonal it’s always hexagonal…
i haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third matrix movie
hey those are my lima beans
but if i don’t eat my lima beans i can’t have my cookie
peas perfect they can be electrons
don’t be ridiculous what would i do with corn
so roller skating should we all grab a bite to eat first
good pf chang’s my mom has coupons
great your mom’s not coming right
okay just to be clear roller skating was my idea and i’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date and i hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes
the plural of coccyx is coccyges
screw you give me back my lima beans
oh my god have you ever been so embarrassed
i don’t know which was lamer their rollerskating or their disco dancing
for me the worst part was when people saw us leave with them
you had some nice moves out there howard
yeah did you notice all the people looking at us
not really i was in my boogie zone
when howard tried to do the splits…
sorry i’m moving a little slow i think i bruised my coccyx
oh what a gentleman hey sheldon steps on marbles which are all over the floor screams and falls
oh my god are you… falls as well
don’t bark at me i fell too
oh you’ve been falling all night you’re used to it
sheldon what the hell are you doing
the same thing i’ve been doing for three days trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet
well i needed something bigger than peas now didn’t i
sheldon when was the last time you got any sleep
i don’t know two three days not important i don’t need sleep i need answers i need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth
toad of truth is that a physics thing
okay sheldon what happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough rem sleep
they lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine
right so march in there brush your teeth and go to bed
but i don’t want to go to bed
i’m going to count to three one…
that was amazing how you handled him
i know how to deal with stubborn children my mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement
leonard you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep
it’s not me it’s my new ringtone the joker from batman
me too but i paid three bucks for it
hello yeah i’m leonard hofstadter yeah yeah he’s my roommate oh god is he okay yeah alright alright i’ll be right there
sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village
hi i’m dr hofstadter where is he
thanks for not calling the cops
oh hey it’s no big deal my sister’s got a kid who’s special
yeah well he’s extra special hey shelly what you doing
size ratio was all wrong couldn’t visualize it needed bigger carbon atoms
sure sure how did you get into this place
back door has a fivepin tumbler system singlecircuit alarm child’s play you can start sorting protons and neutrons while i build carbon atoms
no i don’t think so we need to go home now
if you don’t come out of there i’m going to have to drag you out
you can try but you’ll never catch me he disappears under the balls
for god’s sakes sheldon come here
bazinga disappears pops up in another place bazinga and again bazinga and again bazinga and again bazinga
knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny
knock knock knock leonard and penny
and you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night
because we didn’t want to be disturbed
and that didn’t work out did it
i came to tell you i’ve got the answer
really you figured out the graphene problem
no no i’m still hopelessly stuck on that but i figured out how to figure it out
hey you know what leonard i know i said i could handle your roommate but i was wrong we’re going to have to break up
yeah i’m going to need a little more
when albert einstein came up with special relativity he was working at the patent office
so you’re going to go work at the patent office
don’t be absurd that’s in washington you know i could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheelandspoke pattern no i’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem
of course it is even talking to you is sufficiently menial that i can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow
okay well thanks for sharing with us good night
you’re welcome good night to you too oh by the way i was watching you sleep for a moment and i noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back
no i wasn’t talking to leonard
why thank you for noticing i’m menial employee of the month do you have a particular field in mind
i do for thousands of years the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged do you have anything like that
i didn’t really have to so how about construction
oh that would be good sawing hammering eating out of a lunch pail as my workingclass fellows and i sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis
no no this is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in rosemead
moving on how about doing deliveries for a florist
do you have your own car
of course you don’t mr cooper let me just ask you a question what was your last job
senior theoretical particle physicist at caltech focusing on m theory or in layman’s terms string theory
i see just give me a second security
okay i’ll get those drinks started for you
sheldon what the hell are you doing
i’m trying to get these tables cleared we’re slammed
no wait wait no wait wh what are you doing here
a reasonable question i asked myself what is the most mindnumbing pedestrian job conceivable and three answers came to mind uh toll booth attendant an apple store genius and what penny does now since i don’t like touching other people’s coins and i refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius here i am
you just you just walked in and they hired you just like that
oh heavens no since i don’t need to be paid i didn’t need to be hired i simply came in picked up a tray and started working for the man let me get that plate out of your way
is it just a moment ago i had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate bernadette table 10 wants their check
sheldon wait this isn’t even what i do i’m a waitress not a busboy
you’re right that is more menial hello i’m sheldon i’ll be your server today i don’t recommend the salmon i saw it in the kitchen
all right one bacon cheeseburger breaking two jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously kudos beerbattered fish and chips now here’s your tartar sauce i also brought you salsa it’s a little unconventional but i think you’ll like it it’s zingy and for you factory burrito grande no cheese no sour cream no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance bon appétit
hang on black beans not pinto beans
you understand why i’m doing this to you
that’ll be all that was fun
how long can he keep this up
i heard about this professor at mit who melted down bought a van and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer
he never went back to the university
only to shampoo professor chambourg’s shih tzu
i bet if we all chipped in we could buy sheldon a van
yeah that’s the only thing wrong with that plan
hey guys sorry you had to wait but we are swamped what’s this
well honey not to complain but we were starting to think you didn’t either
is that really necessary good lord the interference pattern in the fracture the motion of the wave through the molecular structure i’ve been looking at it all wrong i can’t consider the electrons as particles they move through the graphene as a wave it’s a wave the moment to applaud would be now troglodytes
sheldon where are you going aren’t you going to clean this up
i’m sorry i don’t work here
i’m on a cloud swing me howard swings raj several times
yeah i miss you too sweetie listen i got to go but i’ll see you tonight okay byebye yeah byebye no you hang up first hello
dude i’m glad you finally got a girlfriend but do you have to do all that loveydovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t
actually he might have to there’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others the term was coined in 1976 by economist fred hirsch to replace the more colloquial but less precise neenerneener
that’s not true my happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone
although i’d be lying if i said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk
oh i used to be like that then i got a girlfriend
hey what are you and bernadette doing for your first valentine’s day
yeah i am pulling out all the stops there’s a 3995 lover’s special at pf chang’s egg rolls dumplings bottomless wok and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front
given that saint valentine was a third century roman priest who was stoned and beheaded wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder
i understand your point but given a choice jews always go with chinese food
well if anyone’s interested i’ll be spending this valentine’s day the same way i spend every valentine’s day buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket taking it home standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal
fine tell us you’re going to have sex with penny
that’s not what i was going to tell you
it’s okay i don’t mind hearing about your sex life it’s his that bugs me
guess who the university is sending to switzerland to attend a conference and see the cern supercollider on february 14
professor norton although god knows why he hasn’t published anything of note since he won that nobel prize
actually professor norton can’t make it he threw his back out rock climbing
i heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend
the bigboobed weather girl on channel 2
in any case they’re asking me to fill in for him
in switzerland or with the bigboobed weather girl
switzerland and i get to bring a guest
this is incredible i’m so happy i’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you i’m just going to run home and start packing
oh well then i anticipate an awkward situation when you get home
of course my good friend come in help me out which ski hat says après supercollider
sheldon i’m not taking you to switzerland
well of course you are who else would you take
what that’s absurd penny has no interest in subatomic particle research
yes but it’ll be valentine’s day we can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped alps
but penny has no interest in subatomic particle research
sorry i’ve been dreaming about going to the large hadron collider since i was nine years old
yeah well i’ve been dreaming about spending valentine’s day with a girl since i was six
shame on you that’s no dream for a scientist
just a minute this tray contains clues as to what you and i are going to be doing on valentine’s day
oh wow okay let’s see we’ve got uh milk chocolate swiss cheese fondue my lactoseintolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this then i’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon
no but it does involve air travel okay um let me slice this swiss cheese with my swiss army knife and then you can wash it down with a cup of swiss miss instant cocoa
okay i’m starting to think swiss is key here
we’re going to disneyland and ride the matterhorn
how does that involve air travel
we’re going to disney world and ride the matterhorn
okay sweetie this started out fun but i’m over it
we’re going to switzerland to see the cern supercollider and ski we’ll also go skiing
well you’ll ski i’ll fall but yeah we will be in switzerland for valentine’s day
oh my god leonard that’s incredible
not so fast you might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli penny
rabeliechtli it means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern handcarved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain swiss festivals which you will not be celebrating because a these festivals occur in the fall and b you will not be going to switzerland
sheldon we’ve been through this i’m taking penny
afraid not do you recognize this
indeed the roommate agreement i call your attention to the friendship rider in appendix c future commitments number 37 in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the large hadron collider now under construction in switzerland he shall invite the other friend to accompany him
you actually put that in an agreement
yeah we also put in what happens if one of us wins a macarthur grant or if one of us gets superpowers or if one of us is bitten by a zombie
he can’t kill me even if i turn
is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend
no that seemed a little farfetched
sheldon do you really expect to enforce this
i’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement at least once a day i ask how you are even though i simply don’t care i no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm and i abandoned my goal to master tuvan throat singing
okay i know i shouldn’t ask but what is…
i’d be much further along if i’d been allowed to practice
look sheldon i know it’s in the agreement and if you turn into a zombie i promise i will not kill you in fact i’ll even let you eat my brains but i am taking penny to switzerland
what do you think the sound of tuvan throat singing comes from sheldon’s bedroom
got a bit of traffic this morning huh think it’s gonna rain instead of underpants i covered my crotch with potato salad this morning thoughts okay i know what’ll cheer you up let’s play one of your driving games
all right this game is called traitors i will name three historical figures you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal benedict arnold judas dr leonard hofstadter
you really think i belong with benedict arnold and judas
you’re right judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did
come on sheldon can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me
round two leonard hofstadter darth vader rupert murdoch
he owns fox and they cancelled firefly hint he and darth vader are tied for number 2
i’m sorry i couldn’t hang with you last night i had a date with bernadette
i know i saw the tweet
so what did you end up doing
not much nuked a burrito prayed to the hindu god urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree
no is he still mad about the supercollider
yeah he thinks i betrayed him i mean come on what would you guys do if you were me
absolutely and i’d leave him there sheldon enters puts a tray in front of leonard and exits
uh let’s see yup 30 pieces of silverware
i’ve made you breakfast juice coffee and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters see here’s frodo
yeah i used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet if you need to void your bladder before eating i can keep them warm with this beret that i thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy
it’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour i’ve had some time to reflect and i’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements it’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other butterscotch scone
what you’re tasting is respect and affection and about a pound of crisco after you’ve finished breakfast i thought we could spend the day watching the final season of babylon 5 with director commentary
i do it fails as drama science fiction and it’s hopelessly derivative but you like it and you’re my friend
okay great still not taking you to switzerland
alright let’s dispense with the friendly banter i believe you know why i’m here
well i always figured it was to study us discover our weaknesses and report back to your alien overlords
yes amusing extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you but let me be more specific i believe you know why i’m here in the laundry room
better acoustics for your throat singing
it’s actually not bad but my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief powerpoint presentation lights why sheldon cooper phd should go to switzerland to see the cern supercollider a powerpoint presentation by sheldon cooper phd
here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe aka me and here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger aka you
i’m sorry is this supposed to be buttering me up
please hold all questions to the end of the presentation this is the large hadron collider at cern in switzerland the product of decades of planning and construction it is a mecca for physicists the world over this is bath and body works on colorado boulevard they sell scented soaps and lotions some of which contain glitter now let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination
no it’s not i’ve got five more slides
sheldon this is leonard’s decision he invited me to switzerland and i intend to go
very well enjoy yourself you’re going to be in the presence of something that i’ve dreamed of seeing for decades i just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents
yes if it means that much to you you should go
since i rarely hug i’m relying on your expertise regarding duration
you know what even though i don’t have a girlfriend i can still have a good time on valentine’s day
trust me you can’t i’ve tried
no no no i’m going to have a me day first i’m going to go to one of those spas in koreatown take a steam and get a massage then i’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies
sheldon i need to talk to you
all right my friend would you like some cholermus
cholermus it’s a traditional swiss breakfast dish i’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of switzerland
oh but i am didn’t penny tell you the good news
she told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her
well forget it i was the one who was invited i get to decide who goes with me and it’s penny not you
howard could you lower the lights i have a short powerpoint presentation
i don’t need to see your presentation this discussion is over
that’s a somewhat ambiguous response am i going or not
sheldon at this point i would go by myself before i would take you
well then you leave me no alternative from this moment forward we can be roommates but we will no longer be friends
i’m sorry you feel that way
i don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here leonard
with the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at bill gates’ house should i be invited
just think this time tomorrow we’ll be in geneva switzerland for our first valentine’s day
i know i went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion
thermal ‘cause it’s gonna be cold
gesundheit or as they say in switzerland gesundheit you getting a cold
no no it’s probably just allergies
do you want an allergy pill ‘cause i have ’em all prescription nonprescription foreign domestic experimental
not really i’m just an enthusiast
did that sound okay to you do not come in here
i’m having a tea party what do you think’s going on i think i might have the flu or the plague
well our plane leaves at 9 am do you think you’ll feel better by then
yep ‘cause i’m gonna be dead
hey sheldon listen penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to switzerland so if you’re still interested you’re welcome to come sound of sheldon vomiting in the bathroom
great i’ll start packing in a minute vomits again oh look it’s the cholermus
why don’t i pour it in your lap and you can tell me
you don’t have to be mean i’m sick
not my problem i just don’t understand how this happened to me i’m scrupulous about my hygiene i regularly disinfect my hands and i avoid contact with other people on general principle
i don’t know what to tell you sheldon
oh my goodness look at this room champagne roses oh and little chocolates this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever
yeah i forgot about all this
will you please turn your shirt off
what i’m giving myself dramatic entrance music people will know i’m awesome and to be feared
yeah right there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples
well you might want to mark your google calendars stan lee is coming to do a signing on thursday
did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography i’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just actionpacked
no just a regular comic signing my uncle is his dermatologist and stan’s doing him a favour
oh i don’t want to know that how can i possibly discuss with stan lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease
stan lee does not have a contagious skin disease
well look who thinks he’s stuart’s uncle now
can’t believe it we’re going to meet stan lee presses play on his ipod his shirt starts to play “i’m so excited” by the pointer sisters he dances
i’m sad to say i taught him those moves
i can’t decide whether i want stan lee to autograph my journey into mystery 83 first appearance of thor or my fantastic four number five first appearance of dr doom raj presses his ipod the theme from jeopardy plays alex i’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass presses again his shirt blows a raspberry
i’ve decided i’m going to have mr lee sign my copy of this month’s batman
that’s crazy stan lee had nothing to do with batman
yes which is why no one else will ask him to sign one and i will be the possessor of a unique albeit confusing artifact which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom
that’s a great idea i’m going to get him to sign a batman as well
what is it about the word unique you don’t understand
ow damn paper cut nothing worse than a paper cut
well obviously you don’t remember your circumcision
there’s neosporin and bandaids in my top desk drawer
why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom
he does and in the kitchen and in the car and in his pocket
yeah but the ones in my pocket are mine
hey guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on thursday
um can you give me a hint
you have no idea who he is do you
of course i do you’re an important part of my life and i pay attention to the things you are interested in
good good so who’s stan lee
um he was on star trek
um uh stan lee oh he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much
oh so is this bruce lee’s nerdy brother stan
sheldon why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk
because most of the things i’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet
but there must be thousands of dollars here why don’t you put it in the bank
i don’t trust banks i believe that when the robots rise up atms will lead the charge
you’ve also got something from the pasadena municipal court
undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order from left to right it’s supposed to be federal state and then city of pasadena
i’m sorry you sent more than one letter about that
looks like you ran a red light on marengo avenue at 9
november 16 penny that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and i had to drive you to the emergency room
penny i have an eidetic memory also that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder
okay then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car bearing your license plates coming to me
okay look they sent me the ticket i told them i wasn’t driving and they were all if it wasn’t you who was it
no it wasn’t a betrayal it was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license i already have to buy my insurance from this place in the cayman islands
but the only reason i was driving your car was because you were in distress and i was rescuing you
yes yes look and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day
it’s not that big a deal you just go down to the court on thursday and you pay the fine
i’m not going to pay a fine that would imply i’m guilty
you are guilty raj’s shirt plays the gavel sound from law  order that one i liked
i am not guilty i only have a learner’s permit penny was the teacher when the light turned yellow she said go go go so i went went went
sheldon i’m sorry i’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine you know as soon as i get a part in a movie or my own tv series
you don’t need to reimburse me because i’m not paying on thursday i will have my day in court and justice will be done in fact i’m going to begin preparing my defence right now
oh that’s right thursday is stan lee day
now you see what you’ve done because of you we’re all going to miss stan lee
whoa what do you mean all
well you’re my friends you’ll be standing by my side supporting me feeding me legal precedents and if you had the upper body strength carrying me out on your shoulders when i’m victorious
are you saying that you will not stand beside me as i plead my case
wow uh stan lee or you in court uh if this was sophie’s choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie no
raj you’ll be there won’t you shirt plays “incorrect” quiz sound all right then my socalled friends have forsaken me so i guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness
please try to wear something appropriate it won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word juicy scrawled across your buttocks
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
wait hold on before we get to the courthouse i’d like to call on your skills as an actress
i’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because let’s face it you’re somewhat of a loose cannon now don’t worry it’s written in your vernacular so shall we rehearse
well of course you have a choice although we live in a deterministic universe each individual has free will now sit down i call your attention to the events of november 16 do you remember that date
darn tootin’ i do if the court will excuse my homespun cornfed nebraskan turn of phrase
the reason that date is like so totally fixed in my memory is that i had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts i’ve ever seen in like ever
and who performed that heroic act
why you did sir you dr sheldon cooper and may i add it is a privilege to know you
there’s no need for compliments this court is only interested in the facts
but it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you totally a teardrop rolls down my cheek
only a suggestion a catch in your throat would work just as well
but it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you totally
maybe you should put on your juicy pants again
good morning your honour dr sheldon cooper appearing in pro se that is to say representing himself
i know what it means i went to law school
and yet you wound up in traffic court anyway if it would please the court i’d like to begin with an opening statement
the court would advise you to make it quick as the court had a diceylooking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an imodium
very well a quick opening statement like a milking stool my case rests on three legs i will demonstrate that i was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic i will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum that which is necessary is legal but first i will raise a sixth amendment issue i’m unable to confront my accuser a nonhuman entity to wit a camera so to sum up improper instruction quod est necessarium est licitum sixth amendment my milk stool is complete
i object you’re completely ignoring the law
no i’m following the law i’m ignoring you
really i would point out that i am at the top of my profession while you preside over the kiddy table of yours
dr cooper before i find you in contempt and throw you in jail i’m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark
i am a scientist i never apologize for the truth
i can’t wait to ask stan lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter
oh come on why would you do that
bruce banner reed richards sue storm stephen strange otto octavius silver surfer peter parker oh and worst of all j jonah jameson jr
okay i’m cutting i’m not gonna talk to stan lee after you cheese him off
what do you think for doing the same crap he always does except to a judge he has to stay in there until he apologizes
oh gee thanks leonard that didn’t occur to me if he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail
oh no that’s terrible ooh the line’s moving got to go bye
i need to use the restroom
knock yourself out points to urinal in cell
well it ain’t a wishing well
please tell the judge i’m ready to apologize
look at that to my friend leonard from stan lee excelsior
awesome mine says to my friend howard from stan lee excelsior
mine says to raj from stan lee
that’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names
hey i didn’t even mention dum dum dugan or green goblin matt murdock pepper potts victor von doom oh and worst of all millie the model
oh hey buddy how’d it go
you know very well how it went
yeah but we all want to hear it from you
i was found guilty and fined 533
i’m going to write you a cheque for that as long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it like the others
i also now have three points on a driver’s licence i do not yet possess and i was forced to issue an undeserved apology simply because i refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals
plus you didn’t get to meet stan lee
okay that’s enough howard the poor guy’s had a tough time he had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit
you’re right so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs stan lee took stuart and us out for gelato
you had gelato with stan lee
he said we could call him stan
well i hope you’re satisfied penny you are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today
not finished it is because of you that i now have a criminal record and it is because of you that i missed out on having gelato with stan lee
okay maybe you’ll have another chance to have…
no no i will never have another chance to have gelato with stan lee because opportunities to have gelato with stan lee come but once in a lifetime the moving finger writes and having writ moves on
did he just somehow give me the finger
not just the finger the moving finger
nothing i’m just getting ready to close up and head out
ah cool got any fun plans
oh yeah big night tonight gonna share a can of tuna with the cat
not even my cat i just feed it some nights it doesn’t even show up
oh okay well i was hoping um you could do me a favour
well i’m kind of responsible for sheldon missing stan lee and i really want to make it up to him so i was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe i can arrange for them to meet
oh i’m sorry i don’t have his phone number
hmm damn all right thank you
mmhmm wait i have his address
but i can’t give it to you
then why did you tell me you had it
i don’t know just chatting you’re looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight
maybe we can make a deal
i will give you the address if you go to my cousin’s wedding with me
you’re extorting a date out of me
i kind of have to the cousin who’s getting married is the cousin i usually go to weddings with
we’ll tell people he’s your cousin
this is stan lee’s front door we were on stan lee’s curb then we were on stan lee’s walk and now we’re at stan lee’s front door
oh lord you just rang stan lee’s doorbell at stan lee’s house we’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with stan lee
okay sweetie i don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies or he’s just gonna say hi or really what’s gonna happen so just let me talk and we’ll…
hi i’m penny this is my friend sheldon
we’re not friends at the moment depends on how this goes
right right anyway sheldon here is a huge fan of yours and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store but he kind of ended up in jail
i see and you thought you’d just come over to my house uninvited
oh no no i said i’m inviting you to come with me to stan lee’s house
you know you fan boys are unbelievable do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want i mean why don’t you just come on in and watch the lakers game with me
well i’m not much of a sports fan but thank you
i’m sorry he doesn’t really understand sarcasm
well i’ll give him something he’ll understand joanie call the police
fantastic four daredevil invincible iron man happy hogan curt connors…
would you just let it go
and worst of all fin fang foom
i’ll tell you where i’ve been you boys may have had gelato with stan lee and gotten autographed comics but i saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order
plus i get to hang out with him again at the hearing this is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from leonard nimoy
why do i always have to carry the heavy stuff
well it’s very simple in our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose i’m the smart one wolowitz is the funny one and koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails that leaves you by default as the muscle
one more floor and i’d be the pulled muscle
oh it’s about time i’m starving
uh well we didn’t actually get chinese food
oh no you didn’t trade the food for magic beans did you
of course not and technically magic beans would be food although eating them would be quite a waste since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk which would provide enough roughage for a small city
yeah sometimes i don’t listen sometimes i just watch your jaw go up and down
we were on our way to the chinese restaurant when we thought we saw adam west so we followed him
who’s adam west leonard what do the two of you talk about after the coitus
my guess is “hey four minutes new record” that’s why i’m the funny one
anyway we followed the guy to this garage sale and they had the coolest stuff
they were closing up we got this whole box for sixty bucks
we didn’t even get to go through it all there could be anything in here
there a new girlfriend in there ‘cause you might need one
no but there is an original final draft ghostbusters script with actual slime stains raj whispers to leonard oh you’re right it’s ghostbusters 2 never mind
oh my god an alf doll when i was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left i used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet melmac and alf was going to bring him back to me but he never did where’s my daddy puppet where is he
no what’s sad is that you don’t know adam west was tv’s batman
here’s spock’s head with no body here’s mr t’s body with no head oh yeah here’s spock’s body with mr t’s head i pity the fool who’s illogical
okay i’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and windowshop on eharmony
ooh look an indiana jones connectthedots
looks like someone drew a penis on him
you see what you’re doing stop that
it appears to be a lord of the rings ring
it’s even got the elvish engraving on it
it’s not elvish it’s the language of mordor written in elvish script one ring to
one ring to bring them all
and in the darkness bind them
so i was doing some checking on the ring
hold on sheldon is there ketchup on that table
yes there is oh here’s a fun fact ketchup started out as a general term for sauce typically made of uh mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices some popular early main ingredients included blueberry anchovy oyster kidney bean and grape
no that’s okay i’ll get it
listen i was looking at the ring and it seemed a little weird no copyright notice on it so i took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with shall we say the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world
you know your black market phasers your screenworn lieutenant uhura panties that kind of stuff
who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have
just a guy i know a guy
no i can’t tell you who it is stop asking
who else could it be it has to be eddie crispo
i know lots of dangerous people okay
eddie crispo anyway he said this isn’t a replica it’s the real deal
if you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by sauron in mount doom i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement
he’s not saying it’s a magic ring you’re not are you
no but it’s close look at the markings inside those are production markings nine rings were made for use in the lord of the rings movies three were given to members of the cast the rest were destroyed except one one was stolen gentlemen this is the one ring
no it is not yours we all went in on the box together
well yes but i found it in the box and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure
other than the lack of water how is it not
wait wait sheldon stop being crazy for a second how much is something like this worth
well it’s tough to say since it’s hot but on the underground market my guy figures…
yes he figures ten maybe 15 thousand
okay that’s a lot of money the wise thing to do is invest it in something practical like a jet ski
why do you want a jet ski
all the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride jet skis that can’t just be a coincidence
we can’t sell it we have to keep it and love it and polish it and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and reenact our favourite scenes from the movies
it’s sad how great that sounds
guys it’s stolen it should go back to peter jackson he made the movies it belongs to him
fine he can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie
clearly you’ve never been to my house for dinner on rosh hashanah
we are not blackmailing peter j… all right where’s the ring
the ring was unguarded it was just sitting on the table anyone could have taken it proof i did
look let’s be reasonable we all want to do different things with the ring but your ideas are stupid and i want a jet ski
i found it the ring is mine i don’t understand why in this group i never get my way
i’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring
hey guys enjoying your food that i actually brought you instead of promising food but bringing you a box of random crap
yeah it’s delicious the sarcasm’s a little stale though hey how about this until we figure out what to do with the ring penny holds on to it
will you hold on to this for a couple of days
it’s a prop from a movie and we’re kind of fighting over it
okay just to be clear the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie and i don’t even get to keep it
if you had gone out with me three years ago by now you’d have my great aunt ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied belgium in a cat
ow you hit me i’m bleeding
sheldon tried to take the ring and i punched him
so sheldon how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl
it’s not the first time i have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero if only i’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her then i’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly christmas letter
gentlemen have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money
i was afraid of that opens his laptop to reveal an indian looking man on a webcam go ahead
don’t answer that i’ll get straight to the point my client’s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two kawasaki jet skis
we’re not giving him two jet skis
look we’re big boys why don’t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle one kawasaki jet ski done and done
all right forget the jet skis
forget the jet skis that was our line in the sand what happened to “tear them a new one”
what can i say they played hardball we lost
i told you that when you hired me
okay just so you know if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers prepare for shock and awe
you know what i am ending this penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore she gave it to me i have it i’m sending it back where’s the ring
you mean this ring next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room
it’s all of ours they begin to struggle over the ring
i’m not letting go you let go
i say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on
fine but can’t we go home and start this
sure let go of the ring
you do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the syfy channel they start to move away from the table while all still holding the ring
wait my laptop they go back for it
you know there’s a point when this becomes idiotic
and it wasn’t when we were driving like this
i would advise the three of you that resistance is futile i have endless patience i once spent twoandahalf hours on hold with hewlettpackard customer service just to complain about their customer service
you want to talk about endless patience penny made me watch all five seasons of sex and the city
no no no the sixth season is great we go to paris with carrie and get our heart broken and then mr big shows up we don’t know if we can trust him again it’s a wild ride
door leonard tries to unlock the door and drops the keys
okay everybody and plie and relevae
last one holding the ring decides its fate i know it sounds silly
no no no no no no you are my boyfriend nothing you do is silly to me
fyi this is a bag from victoria’s secret
i’m sorry ma i have to stay late at the office
no he’s doesn’t he’s lying to you
well if you want privacy let go of the ring i’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club howard here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s gstring
i think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner from what i know about these things if a woman doesn’t breastfeed on time it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies
don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies
if you’re offended let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies
excellent excellent tire each other out the ring will be mine howard why don’t you go after raj’s mother
why don’t we go after your mother
go ahead i have no illusions about my mother she is a kind loving religiously fanatical rightwing texan with a slightly outofscale head and a mild dr pepper addiction anything you’d like to add
that’s not gonna better pull out the big gun
you’re right let’s talk about your grandmother
think about this the only way your mother was born was your meemaw had sex
i don’t want to hear this
then let go of the ring and walk away
all right i’ll bet your meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother i bet she had sex because she liked it
subliminal messaging i’m going to make you want to pee dripping faucets leaky gutter peeing
ohhoho it’s working all right i have to pee
then let go of the ring and go
no actually i wouldn’t mind going too
fine um on the count of three one two…
wait just to clarify when you get to three do we stand up or do we pee
something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes
i’ve done it i’ve won the ring is mine it’s mine he runs to the bathroom we’re going to clean it up and make it pretty my own my love my precious he looks in the mirror and has turned into golem he screams and wakes up still on the settee where’s the ring
it’s in a fedex box on its way back to where it came from
peter jackson’s office in new zealand it wasn’t ours
you quit the game you had no right to take it
i came in here you guys were all sleeping the ring was on the floor no one was touching it
well so then we start the game over until there’s a winner
there wasn’t ever going to be a winner there was going to be a selfish petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend is that really what you guys want ‘cause if it is fine i don’t want anything to do with you and i don’t know what happened in that bathroom but i am not cleaning it up goes to his bedroom takes a box from under his bed takes out the ring my precious
i knew it give us the precious
ugh gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym
okay in avatar when they have sex in pandora they hook up their ponytails so we know their ponytails are like their junk
so when they ride horses and fly on the birds they also use their ponytails
my point is if i were a horse or a bird i’d be very nervous around james cameron
it amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about for example why wasn’t william shatner in the new star trek movie
hey sheldon i was up in the administration office and i happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s chancellor’s award for science
and you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again i am the william shatner of theoretical physics all right i’ll play what selfimportant preening fraud are they honouring this year
oh i’m so glad you asked it like that you
i won this is astonishing not that i won the award no one deserves it more actually i guess i misspoke it’s not astonishing more like inevitable i’m not sure what to do first maybe i should call my mother wait i know i’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online
yeah the one thing the william shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost
didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull
hey you didn’t want a slurpee at 7eleven you don’t get glasses
oh that will be another congratulatory call for me uh mute please
hello oh chancellor morton how are you sir yes i was expecting your call aside three years ago i see wait what happens if i choose not to give a speech uhhuh and if i don’t want to forfeit the award well you’ve got that tied up in a neat little bow all right thank you hangs up problem
they expect me to give a speech at the banquet i can’t give a speech
well no you’re mistaken you give speeches all the time what you can’t do is shut up
yeah before the movie you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown it turned brown while you were talking
i am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups i cannot speak to large crowds
what to you is a large crowd
any group big enough to trample me to death general rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children
sheldon congratulations brought you cheesecake from work you know ’cause of your award not because a busboy sneezed on it
turns out the great sheldon cooper has stage fright
that’s no reason to back out you know i once got a pretty big honour in high school and i was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd but i went through with it and you know what the world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a ford f150 as a member of the corn queen’s court
thank you yeah i’ll bear that in mind if i’m ever nominated for the hillbilly peace prize
am i let me tell you a story
where’s 70 children when you need ‘em
i was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college summa cum laude is latin for with highest honours
i just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks
i was valedictorian and expected to give an address even now i can remember that moment when i walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd there must have been thousands of people my heart started pounding in my chest i began to hyperventilate my vision became blurry and before i knew it… oh dear he faints
come on mother you know why i can’t accept the award with all due respect i don’t think praying will help no i have not heard the song jesus take the wheel no no no no no no no you don’t need to start singing it yes i’ll buy it on the itunes mother goodbye mother enters apartment the others are sitting as if waiting for him hello
sit down we want to talk to you
am i in trouble did my mother call you
we think we can help you with your stage fright
oh i doubt that i haven’t figured out a way and i’m much smarter than all of you
yes but you’re not smarter than all of us put together
oh i’m sorry that is what i meant
okay your problem is you’re trying to do this all by yourself
we can help you we can be your team like uh professor xavier and his xmen
yeah we watched it last week you said you liked it
oh i say a lot of things sweetie so how about it sheldon
i don’t know if you’re my xmen what are your powers
okay well i am going to take you shopping get you a nice suit might give you more confidence
that’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into xavier’s school for gifted youngsters but go on leonard
i thought i could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety
what qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind
my mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist and i’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breastfeeding codependently
raj says he can teach you what did you call it i don’t know some indian meditation crap
i see well i assume since the rest of you have set the bar so low you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last go ahead howard dazzle me
my power is the ability to pretend like i give a damn about your piddlyass problems and that’s 247 buddy
so what do you say sheldon are we your xmen
no the xmen were named for the x in charles xavier since i am sheldon cooper you will be my cmen
oh that’s not a good name
okay sheldon i’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises these methods come from the ancient gurus of india and have helped me overcome my own fears
and yet you can’t speak to women
true but thanks to meditation i am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating now close your eyes
when i was little my sister would say to me close your eyes you’ll get a surprise and then she’d punch me
i’m not going to punch you
that’s what my sister used to say
do you want to do this or not
all right imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home where is that
sim city more specifically the sim city i designed sheldonopolis
where exactly sheldon square sheldon towers sheldon stadium home of the fighting sheldons
i thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation
really this time of year it’s a bit nippy
suppose i could run downtown and pick up something at shelmart
yeah whatever just go buy a sweater
you know the nice thing about shelmart is i own it so i get a 15 discount
you own the damn thing just take a freaking sweater
look i didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willynilly
all right you’ve paid for a sweater and you’re in sheldon square
hang on it’s a cardigan i have to button it oh no
a godzillalike monster is approaching the city i have to get my people to safety people of sheldonopolis this is your mayor follow me if the children can’t run leave them behind oh the simulated horror sound of door slamming raj just as i suspected meditation is nothing but hokum
i question your premise how is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people
it’ll give you confidence you know sometimes when i’m feeling all stressed out about something i go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and i have a whole new outlook on life
don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt
yeah that’s when i buy shoes now let’s see what we’ve got ooh this is nice
that’s a lot of money for only one colour
fine why don’t you pick out what you like
hmm cut to sheldon exiting changing room in a loud check suit this is pretty sharp
this is great i had a suit like this when i was six cut to sheldon exiting in a white dinner suit with tails okay i think we have a winner
where the hell d’you find that
says the former member of the corn queen’s court
please just try this one on
okay but anything i put on now is only going to suffer in comparison goes into changing room comes out in black suit looking terrific this is absurd i look like a clown
that’s how you start a psychotherapy session how am i doing i was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious instead i get the same question i hear from the lady who slices my bologna at ralph’s
would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams
i recently had a dream that i was a giant but everything around me was to scale so it all looked normal
how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale
i was wearing size a million pants
ah the talking cure classical freudian good choice if it will help speed things along uh my answers to the standard rorschach ink blot test are a a bat b a bat c a bat and d my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle
why don’t i just start sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if on a subconscious level they don’t feel they deserve them do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here
really leonard you’re just going to try to recycle adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex i could probably get that from the woman at ralph’s and she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free
but it could be part of your problem let me give you an example when i was eight i won a ribbon at the science fair for my project “do lima beans grow better to classical music” but my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “do lima beans grow worse to rock ‘n’ roll” i felt so guilty i gave the ribbon back
and how did that make you feel
terrible i worked really hard on that project i stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from pagliacci to a lima bean sprout
it wasn’t my fault i had never seen my brother’s project and my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone
so i hear you saying you’re angry with your mother
damn right i’m angry with my mother for god’s sake i was eight years old she humiliated me that’s when the bedwetting started again
if someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning i think i can face a simple award ceremony
wait that’s it i thought we had a whole hour
good evening ladies and gentlemen my name is dr leonard hofstadter and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s chancellor’s award for science and my good friend dr sheldon cooper but before i do i’d like to share with you a letter from sheldon’s mother who couldn’t be here tonight isn’t that nice his mother sent him a letter she’s proud of him i wonder what that feels like dear shelly that’s what she calls him shelly it’s a pet name you know what my mother’s pet name for me is leonard but i digress dear shelly i am so proud of… continues as background noise
don’t worry you’re surrounded by your cmen
i can’t do this i’m going to faint
here drink this it’ll relax you
i don’t feel different this alcohol’s defective
here see if this one works
first of all the projects were totally different i was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow but my mother didn’t hear me if you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth i’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me
oh right ladies and gentlemen our guest of honour dr sheldon cooper
thanks shortyi’ll take it from here all right you people ready to have some fun you have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology well then here come the jokes why did the chicken cross the mobius strip to get to the same side bazinga all right a neutron walks into a bar and asks how much for a drink the bartender says for you no charge hello i know you’re out there i can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience dr randall from the geology department only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite bada cha i kid the geologists of course but it’s only ’cause i have no respect for the field let’s get serious for a moment why are we all here ‘cause we’re scientists and what do scientists study the universe and what’s the universe made of i am so glad you asked singing there’s antimony arsenic aluminium selenium and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium and nickel neodymium
penny leonard would you be able to answer some questions i’m having about the events of last night
question one where are my pants
you might want to check youtube
it’s already loaded just hit play
oh lord this couldn’t be any more humiliating
having a little trouble catching your breath there
no no i’m good if my pe teachers had told me this is what i was training for i would have tried a lot harder
do or do not there is no try
did you just quote star wars
i believe i quoted empire strikes back
oh my god i’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote yoda i love you penny
you’re welcome i just wanted to put that out there
oh yeah no i i’m i’m glad
yeah yeah no no um so it’s getting pretty late we should probably go to sleep
hey leonard where do you come down on giant ants
sheldon says impossible howard and i say not only possible but as a mode of transportation way cooler than a batmobile
you are ignoring the squarecube law the giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton and for the record the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack hoverboard transporter batmobile and then giant ant
seriously you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants
perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle
not literally but as far back as the 17th century scientists observed a 33day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels
interesting that might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month you know what i’m talking about
okay forget giant ants how about giant rabbits
big or small i don’t like rabbits they always look like they’re about to say something but they never do
rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size and on a side note they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis
maybe that’s what they want to talk about
leonard where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position
really because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions
what do you want from me i just don’t give a rat’s ass
would that be a giant rat’s ass
for the record giant rats are possible
can we please talk about something else maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet
okay how about this for a topic why is leonard being a giant douche assuming giant douches are possible
of course they are leonard’s being one
maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with penny
i don’t want to talk about it
but i sense you’re going to and i don’t want to hear about it excuse me
what’d you do romeo you pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack
did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around but it wound up just creeping her out
i’m just asking dude it happens
you guys still on for bowling tonight
oh yes in fact i’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion you bowl like your mama unless of course she bowls well in which case you bowl nothing like her
that is what is referred to as a burn on you
did you ask her to start waxing
while making love did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out mommy
i’m walking away from you now
yeah i think we’re getting close
did you take a benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her because you can die that way
oh that would be a good way to go
good penny reminder bowling tonight at seven o’clock
you don’t have to come if you don’t want to
no no it’s okay i mean let’s face it you guys would get creamed without me
we would indeed in this particular case your lack of femininity works to our advantage
it’s always nice chatting with you sheldon
please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes
i thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes
these are my own bowling shoes
i know where my feet have been
hey penny and you guys albino bob couldn’t make it so i brought a substitute i believe some of you know wil wheaton
well well well if it isn’t wil wheaton the green goblin to my spiderman the pope paul the fifth to my galileo the internet explorer to my firefox
you’re not still carrying a grudge because i beat you at that card tournament are you
i’m the proud owner of wil wheaton stinks dot com dot net and dot org what does that tell you
it tells me that i am living rentfree right here pointing at sheldon’s head you ready to bowl
oh i’m ready i don’t know if stuart told you what you’re up against tonight but before you stands the cocaptain of the east texas christian youth holy roller bowling league championship team seven to twelve yearold division also penny’s pretty good
oh foolish wil wheaton it was never off
a common spare the miss congeniality of the bowling pageant before you jump on twitter to tout your modest accomplishment watch how it’s really done i am the ball my thoughts are its thoughts its holes are my holes gets a strike yes tweet that tweety bird
hey i just wanted to tell you i’m a big fan
i’m sure you’re probably sick of star trek questions but whoopi goldberg you ever hit that
ah beer the magic elixir that can turn this poor shy indian boy into the life of the party oh yeah
yes i love chilli cheese fries
no reason i’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something
do you really want to get into this right now
get into what why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries they’ve been in your life a long time they make you happy they deserve to know
okay look you just caught me by surprise last night i didn’t know what to say
okay well now you’ve had some time to think about it so what do you want to say
how can you not be sure
okay this isn’t the place to have this conversation
no the place to have the conversation was in bed after i said i love you and you said thank you good night
you are you don’t get to decide when i’m ready to say i love you
ah the premature i love you
i guessed premature does that count
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
i’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip cathy when she’s upset she says ach and eats ice cream
if you were a cat i would have brought you a lasagna
did leonard send you over here
no we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton
i’m not too proud to admit that i cried myself to sleep
and let me tell you sleep did not come easily with leonard in the next room singing along with alanis morrisette
no clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream
all right sheldon what part of this is supposed to make me feel better
the part where i tell you i’ve engineered a rematch with stuart’s team for tonight
oh honey i don’t know things are a little weird with leonard right now
you want me to remove him from the team i’m the captain i can do that
no no that’s okay just let me talk to him and i’ll get back to you
when are you going to talk to him
he’s in the laundry room now now would be a good time
you’re not gonna leave me alone until i do it are you
oh i think we both know the answer to that question
i think we should talk now
what no it’s okay we don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about everything’s good
really so you didn’t get all snarky ’cause i said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries
all right maybe i overreacted so we’re in two different places emotionally so what and maybe i’m a little ahead of you that’s fine you know in fact it makes sense ’cause let’s face it i’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you
look leonard you have to know how much i care about you it’s just that i’ve said the l word too soon before and it didn’t work out very well
really i wouldn’t know what that’s like
i’m sorry you know what i’m talking about though
yes that’s what i’m telling you we are good we are great
all right fence mended problem swept under the rug time to bowl yes i was eavesdropping there’s a lot at stake here
attention all bowlers i’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch
no not the wesley crushers the wesley “crushers”
wesley crusher was wil wheaton’s character on star trek
it’s a blindingly clever play on words by appropriating his character’s name and adding the s we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of wesley
okay i’m sorry honey but the wesley crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like wesley crusher
what no again it’s not the wesley crushers it’s the wesley “crushers”
you know if you want it to mean you’re crushing wesley it’d be the “wesley” crushers
do you people even hear yourselves it’s not the wesley crushers it’s not the “wesley” crushers it’s the wesley “crushers”
hey look they named their team after me
no it’s not the… never mind
so we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes
oh yes the losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor fyi i plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited velikovsky hypothesis
hey sheldon i just wanted you to know that i’m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you
oh yes well before i respond let me ask you a question is your mother a good or poor bowler
no after you as we are currently crushing you wesley
it’s customary for the player on the righthand lane to bowl first
it’s a custom not a rule
that’s right sheldon embrace the dark side
that’s not even from your franchise
i um i want you to know that even though we’re on opposite sides i i bear you no ill will
thank you stuart it’s nice to know
mmm mmm people from opposite sides often have good relationships you know romeo and juliet tony and maria from west side story what’shisname and the big blue chick in avatar i’m gonna bowl now
it’s good that we got out and did something physical
gets us out of our heads you get in your head you start to overthink overanalyze obsess you worry that’s not what we’re doing tonight tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins
mmhmm and someday we don’t know when maybe you’ll love me back ooh i’m up
excuse me i don’t know who you’re chanting for as i am currently the ball
the ball the ball the ball the ball the ball the ball
thank you jesus as my mother would say
i’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend
it’s always tough when the l bomb gets dropped and you’re not ready for it
i dated this one girl and i told her that i loved her and she said she wasn’t sure and she strung me along for almost two years it was brutal
thanks yeah i wish she had just broken up with me right there put me out of my misery
did you let wil wheaton get in your head
he’s evil he plays evil mind games did he tell you his grandmother died
well if he does don’t believe it he’s not above playing the dead meemaw card
enjoy the accolades now wil wheaton but like your time on star trek
all right remember his meemaw’s alive and be the ball
we really need a strike here
so just take your time and concentrate
yeah you are just back off
okay i’m sorry i’ll shut up
fine just tell me what to do and i’ll do it
no this isn’t fair to you leonard i’m sorry
wait where are you going penny come back i’ll get you ice cream
are you insane if she leaves it’s over
i’m pretty sure it’s already over
do you think i would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match
mmhmm mmhmm yeah i’m telling you the matchcom chicks are much looser than on eharmony you know i i gotta call you back i won a bet and it’s time to collect
i don’t know about you but i feel empowered
oh damn they cancelled my visa oh yay a new mastercard
i was going to get my mail
okay are are you hoping to get it telepathically
i think you mean telekinetically and no i just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and leonard are no longer having coitus
god can we please just say no longer seeing each other
well we could if it were true but as you live in the same building you see each other all the time the variable which has changed is the coitus
okay here’s the protocol you and i are still friends and you stop saying coitus
good good i’m glad we’re still friends
oh yes it was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life i’d hate for that effort to have been in vain
just to be clear do i have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you
harsh terms but all right i’ll just substitute intercourse
or fornication yeah but that has judgmental overtones so i’ll hold that in reserve
well my existence is a continuum so i’ve been what i am at each point in the implied time period
you’re just coitusing with me aren’t you
he seems all right although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on oh but now that i think of it he asked me not to tell you that
i’ll pretend i didn’t hear it
i’d rather you pretend i didn’t say it i see you bought mama italia marinara spaghetti sauce
that’s the sauce my mother uses she likes cooking italian because according to her that’s what the romans made jesus eat
interesting i’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night
oh um okay why don’t you give me an hour and come over
will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce
oh it’s all right i do oh you’re in for what my mother calls a real eyetalian treat enters apartment
what’s wrong with you you can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex that’s totally uncool
no no it’s fine i don’t care i’m over it
yeah he’s over it that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memorywiper gizmo from men in black
is he making any progress because i’d like to erase ben affleck as daredevil
so would ben affleck the point is in a situation like this you got to pick sides you’re either on team leonard or team penny
well usually i’m on the team that picks last unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair
sheldon i got you your tangerine chicken i hope you’re hungry
well of course i’m hungry and as i have no plans to eat with any other team i will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto mm mm mm
just out of curiosity do we still have hot dogs
just making dinner conversation go team leonard
let me ask you a question do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork
jews don’t have hell we have acid reflux
do you want the last dumpling sheldon
certainly it’s not like i have to moderate my food intake because i’m planning on eating again very shortly mm mm mm
so you guys want to do something tonight
nah i can’t i got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool looks like the manatee tank at sea world
oh there it is now that you don’t have a girlfriend you want to hang out with me again
i never stopped hanging out with you
oh please we all know i’m the friend you call when you have no other options if we were the justice league i’d be aquaman
i wish you were aquaman then i could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank
excuse me i’m thirsty so i’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage
you know what i’ll just spend the evening alone
what suddenly i’m not good enough for you
ah i do so love beverages now i think i’ll take my afterdinner walk
since when do you take afterdinner walks
yeah since when do you take walks
i read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion but increases serotonin and you know me if there’s one thing i like more than a refreshing beverage it’s serotonin byebye
hold on i’ll walk down with you
oh that’s not necessary you can go first
i can’t think of a reason why not
all right say hello to your mother for me
you said you were going for a walk
so what you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs
no of course not that would be odd and suspicious behavior
i parked my scooter down the block
i’m going the other way bye
bye actually i’m this way do i smell hot dogs
no i mean i have no idea what you smell
i definitely smell raw hot dog
perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour
all right have a nice walk
i shall have a nice scoot
you might want to stand back i’m sitting on top of 13 horses here
oh hello doggie nice doggie i bet you think you smell hot dogs look a cat
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny long pause knock knock knock penny penny opens door a dishevelled sheldon is holding up one hot dog here i had to trade the others for my life
i haven’t had sex in a year
where you going with this raj
don’t flatter yourself dude i want to go out and meet a woman
well i need a wingman i don’t want to come off like a lonely loser
and you think my presence will help with that
well i do next to you i’ll look like a catch
i’m not going out tonight raj
all right would you mind if i went to your room and downloaded some asian pornography
don’t worry you’ll meet a girl someday
yes you will and she’ll be beautiful and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman
i do and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart and she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic little pieces
but we’ll have sex first right
so um was leonard okay with you coming over
oh yes in fact he said i’m fine i don’t care and he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal
i’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you
oh i believe that was something else i wasn’t supposed to mention
do you have a stomach ache too
why did you ask if i had one too
just making polite dinner conversation your turn
all right so what’s new in your life
well my new shoes are not made for running
no it’s just a suspicion i have mmm mmm mmm
i’m so glad you like it
i do leonard never cooks for me
well maybe that’s ’cause leonard can’t cook
you can’t cook and you made me this
whatever ooh i’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge
oh lord i’m in jewish hell
look at this do you think she’s really doing that or is it photoshop
i’m pretty sure martha stewart never got naked with a room full of big fat japanese guys
you don’t know that prison changes people
for an hour and a half
how could you get lost your phone has gps
there are no solar flares right now
dude i’m an astrophysicist if there were solar flares i’d be all up in it
i’m sorry i misspoke what i meant to say was my battery died
what the hell was that about
i don’t know do you think this is really hillary clinton doing it with oprah
oh we really need to get you a girl
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
thanks for seeing me on such short notice
maybe this isn’t a good time
tell me why you woke me up or i swear to god i will kill you
do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me
you may want to sit down
point taken you may want to sit up
i’ve been seeing penny behind your back
okay when you say seeing penny what exactly does that mean
we had dinner last night she made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it well little hot dog i gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog a real big dog a hell hound tangential to the primary story how about i circle back to it
fine why did you have dinner with penny
i told you she made spaghetti with little hot dogs i like spaghetti with little hot dogs
then why did you have chinese food with us
i didn’t want to upset you howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money
is it possible he said bros before hos
yes but i rephrased it to avoid offending the hos
sheldon i don’t care if you want to be friends with penny
oh well so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified
well then as my meemaw would say looks like we butchered a pig but nobody wanted bacon
and now as promised the tangent sheldon and the hell hound or how i lost my hot dogs
oh um i i can come back
ddon’t be silly we’re neighbours we’re going to run into each other may as well get used to it
me neither oh sheldon seemed think that i would be upset about you hanging out with him but i just want you to know it’s fine
oh oh good because um his mother called me
yeah she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels
i was going to do that
oh well then you you do it
no i don’t want to do it you can do it
okay you can take him for shoes
i just took him for shoes
well all i know is he says they hurt his feet
fine i’ll take him for shoes next saturday
oh no no no a bunch of us from work are going to disneyland next saturday and sheldon wants to come
well he heard me making plans on the phone was i going to say no
all right but let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food i don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste
we’re going to disneyland he’s going to eat junk food
all i’m saying is give me a headsup
and don’t let him go on space mountain after he eats he’ll say he can handle it but i promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes
all right got it is there anything else
yeah don’t let goofy near him he’ll have nightmares and i’ll have to deal with it
wish i knew he’s fine with pluto

yeah it’s just one sneeze raj sneezes you’re on your own
oh leonard i have something for you per our roommate agreement this is your 24hour notice that i will be having a nonrelated female spending two nights in our apartment
when you say nonrelated female you still mean human right
of course pets are banned under the roommate agreement with the exception of service animals such as seeing eye dogs and one day cyberneticallyenhanced helper monkeys
are you planning on kidnapping a woman
yes but mixed with genuine concern
for your information i’ll be playing host to dr elizabeth plimpton
yes and until you acquire a surgical mask please address your comments to me through a napkin we’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe and now she’s under consideration for a position at our university
why didn’t you tell me you knew elizabeth plimpton i am a huge fan of hers
i didn’t realize i was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of but very well you enjoy canadian bacon i’ve been to toronto
okay fine where is she going to sleep
holy crap through napkin holy crap
yeah um i have a twopart question
a are you kidding me and b seriously are you freaking kidding me
a i rarely kid and b when i do kid you will know it by my use of the word bazinga
so you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed
thank you why is a worldrenowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel
well she doesn’t care for hotels and who can blame her windows that don’t open multiuser linens keys shaped like credit cards as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet all right i believe i have time for one more question yes raj
when can i sit with you again
when i’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart you know the drill all right if you’ll excuse me i am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics
i can’t believe he’s friends with elizabeth plimpton
i can’t believe they let him into canada
whoa whoa whoa you heard the man where’s your throat cultures kidding sit down
oh penny excellent i have a question about these maxi pads are the wings truly functional or have i fallen victim to marketing hype
what what are you doing with what
the stock boy at walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject
sheldon what are you doing with maxi pads
i have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days
i want her to feel at home i also bought scented soaps pantyhose midol calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel
wait wait hold on back up you’re having a woman stay with you
yes why does that seem to flabbergast everybody
oh no no no no i’m not flabbergasted i’m puzzled yeah let’s go with puzzled
a word of warning my guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber
shoe sales hair styles mud masks gossip about your friends brad and angelina
i’m not surprised considering the way you talk about them behind their backs
she’s here she’s here how do i look do i look smart
oh good grief this isn’t about you coming now listen one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century so pay attention years from now my biographer might ask you about this event
oh i have so many things to tell your biographer
ah dr cooper thank goodness i completely forgot your address but then i remembered that i’d written it on my hand lucky for me i didn’t confuse it with what i’d written on my other hand which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star ‘cause if i tried to go there i’d be crushed by hypergravity anyway hello
nice to finally meet you in person
i would imagine it is this is my friend and roommate dr leonard hofstadter
hilo oops i started to say hi and then i switched to hello in the middle it came out hilo duh uh it’s nice to meet you i’ve read both your books and most of your papers i’m leonard i live
i apologize he’s only an experimental physicist
no need to apologize some of my best friends are experimental physicists well not my best friends but i know them my best friend is a molecular chemist named wendy i’m sorry i’m rambling hilo
are you hungry thirsty can i offer you anything
no she’s my guest if anyone should offer her anything it should be me elizabeth can i get you something perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowelregulating yogurt
interesting choices based on my current needs i guess i’d pick the yogurt
excellent if the yogurt works i bought some delightful scented candles
thank you so much for opening up your home to me
well who wants to stay in a hotel with windows that don’t open those crazy cardshaped keys
no he doesn’t understand i understand
oh blows a raspberry i think any university would want you except of course any university that had already had you because they would’ve already wanted you before they you know got you
from the mind that brought you hilo let me show you to your room
all right i guess i am tired good night leonard
uh sleep night i mean obviously good night i started to say sleep tight then i changed my mind in the middle i swear to god i’m smart
all right let me show you some of the features of the room first windows conventional open closed open closed halfway open or halfway closed depending on your philosophical bent over here is my comic book collection feel free to browse there’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand
in here you’ll find emergency provisions an eightday supply of food and water a crossbow season two of star trek
what if there’s a disaster that destroys all the usb ports
then there’s really no reason to live is there
can i ask a question about your roommate
he’s an odd duck isn’t he
well there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall it ended as inexplicably as it began they had very little in common except for carnal activity that’s why i acquired these noisecancelling headphones if you decide to use them please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the wet wipes you’ll find in the bathroom they’re in the drawer labelled wet wipes
good i’ll leave you to your night time ablutions i’ve emailed you the morning bathroom schedule you’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet it’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram
oh let me just get one thing it’s my backup emergency supply kit the living room escape route doesn’t pass through here now good night and if there’s an apocalypse good luck
me neither oh look what i’m reading it’s you
i thought you already read it
i did but it’s been a while and i wanted to sound smart over breakfast
oh good wasn’t sure it was coming across
oh the extragalactic distance ladder want to know a little secret
i wrote the section on the wilsonbappu effect completely naked
really uh sure doesn’t read that way
here let me show you when we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars we start to see removes robe a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in hubble’s constant
wow you really make science come alive
vocal test morning vocal test second vocal test second morning vocal test
morning i trust you had a pleasant night
excuse me i’m going to relieve myself
how do you take your coffee
pee for houston pee for austin pee for the state my heart got lost in and shake twice for texas
all right elizabeth the bathroom is yours the seat is down and has been sanitized for your protection
that’s very thoughtful but i think i’ll finish my coffee first
ah so the yogurt didn’t work i’ll fire off a critical email to the manufacturer
oh good you’re up look my car won’t start i need a ride to work
did you once again ignore your check engine light
no mr smartypants i ignored the fill gas tank light
leonard penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work
oh yeah sure let me just put this in a travel mug
oh penny this is dr plimpton a leading expert on quantum cosmology dr plimpton penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine
nice to meet you too are you enjoying your stay
wonderful meaningless pleasantries accomplished elizabeth leonard’s bathroom time is coming up and believe me you do not want to follow him
okay well i guess i should get dressed so i can take everyone to work you and sheldon and sheldon’s friend dr plimpton who you just met it’ll be fun like a clown car
what uh you and me yeah we did not too long ago how are you doing with it
not as good as you apparently
you know what it’s it’s none of my business if you want to sleep with sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other go for it
excuse me i’m uncomfortable with you recommending that leonard pursue having intercourse with dr plimpton who i assure you has better things to do
i’m not recommending it i’m saying it already happened
come on it wasn’t my fault
the implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts
you know what i’m just gonna take the bus to work
penny i can still drive you
oh no no it’s okay you might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant
i must say i’m shocked by this betrayal
elizabeth’s my friend and you’re playing with her
what the hell are you doing
maybe but i don’t care that’s the great thing about nyquil it’s like tenpercent booze i call it the nighttime sniffling sneezing coughing so you can talk to girls medicine
are you having trouble sleeping ‘cause boy i was up all night
did you get a cold too
no but i was awake all night
if you want i can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills
she doesn’t know she takes them
no that’s okay it was something else keeping me up last night and again this morning and i didn’t mind i was up last night i was up this morning i didn’t mind those are your clues
ooh ooh did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies
were you up making another stopmotion lego movie
‘cause let me tell you it’s not enough to make the legos move they also have to capture your heart
okay i’ll give you one more clue it involved another person
did you get a japanese love pillow
how is a japanese love pillow another person
it is if you love her and give her a name
dr plimpton i’d like you to meet my colleagues dr rajesh koothrappali
i’m a big fan of your work
and of course you’ve already introduced yourself to dr hofstadter
boy i’m kind of tuckered out how are you feeling elizabeth
you know what i am a little tired would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee
actually now i think i want it hot brown and sweet
what do you mean what it’s halo night
i can’t i’m too sick go away
that’s why we moved halo night here look i brought my mom’s chicken soup
don’t send him away let him in
can i ask you a question howard do you like roleplaying games
yeah sure in fact i’m a dungeon master
not tonight tonight you are a delivery man you brought soup but uhoh raj and i don’t have enough money to pay you so we’ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement
you two figure out the details i’m going to go change into something i don’t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh
go away she wants new delhi not kosher deli besides you have a girlfriend
i was waiting for the right time this is the right time
oh this is like a nightmare get lost
he’s right the numbers are shaky enough as it is
what’s going on is you and howard are my moving men and raj is my new landlord and i don’t have enough money to pay any of you
is she suggesting what i think she’s suggesting
yep welcome to the penthouse forum
okay show of hands who’s up for this only howard raises his hand
we’ll all be naked in front of each other
follow my lead almost we’re we’re going to go out into the hallway and uh make a dramatic entrance
oh good it’s so much better when everyone commits
run run run run don’t look back
i thought we had something special
so you say you can’t pay your rent
i found these in the dryer i’m assuming they belong to sheldon
thanks it’s really hard to find these in his size so listen i’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning
you mean you and dr slutbunny
well you don’t owe me an explanation
oh i’m judging you nine ways to sunday but you don’t owe me an explanation
nevertheless i’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why i did what i did
okay babydoll pink let’s see if you can cover up the fact that i got my dad’s feet
it’s just two degrees sheldon i just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees
yes if we lived in a teakettle
you know what go to hell and set their thermostat
can i sleep on your couch tonight
uh well you can try but the people across the hall are being very noisy
apparently the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat then the other fella went batcrap crazy
well not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him
believe it or not he was worse when i met him
oh i do not believe that
you are so naive just like i was seven years ago flasback
excuse me i’m looking for sheldon cooper’s apartment
run fast run far end of flashback
that should have been my first clue
so sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off
for all i knew he was the crazy one he had this really deranged look
well yeah he’d been living with sheldon
sure it makes sense now flashback past leonard is getting out of the lift anyway i went upstairs and knocked on the door
in retrospect that was clue number two
i’m leonard hofstadter i called you about the apartment you said…
i know what i said i know what you said i know what my mother said on march 5 1992 what is the sixth noble gas
you said you’re a scientist what is the sixth noble gas
are you asking me or telling me
all right next question kirk or picard
oh uh well that’s tricky um well uh original series over next generation but picard over kirk
correct you’ve passed the first barrier to roommatehood you may enter
oh this is pretty nice uh the bedrooms are back there
i don’t understand their their existence is conditional
no but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers
each more daunting than the last have a seat
this seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer it also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation as a result i’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs
cathedra mea regulae meae that’s latin for my chair my rules now you said on the phone that your area of study is physics
doesn’t concern you you’ll be going to the university every day
and you’ll be willing to drive me
i can i choose not to
okay i suppose i could drive you well that’s a point in my favour right
why don’t you let me do this
last question in a postapocalyptic world which task would you assign the highest priority locating a sustainable food source reestablishing a functioning government procreating or preserving the knowledge of mankind
uh i’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge
that’s correct fyi i would have accepted any answer other than procreating come i’ll show you the rest of the apartment
oh good i passed the barriers
the second barrier don’t get cocky this is the bathroom are you fairly regular
this isn’t going to work if you’re guessing when do you evacuate your bowels
when you have to i’m sorry i don’t rent to hippies
i i’m sorry uh in the morning around eight
i can’t give you eight i can give you seven thirty
third barrier passed you have won the right to see your room huzzah
no this is my room people don’t go in my room
if people don’t go in there and you’re people and… you are people aren’t you making a joke
your room you may want to repaint end of flashback
okay and after all that you just moved in
no i didn’t just move in first we had to iron out a few details flashback
roommates agree that friday nights shall be reserved for watching joss whedon’s brilliant new series firefly
does that really need to be in the agreement
we might as well settle it now it’s going to be on for years initial here all right that’s television and movies section nine miscellany the apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure
never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress and next if either of us ever invents time travel we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds
well that’s disappointing end of flashback
why on earth did you agree to all that
it was the best apartment i’d seen the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way
well i’m sorry leonard it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you
okay how about this let me tell you about the first time i brought a girl over flashback to leonard’s bedroom
shh just pretend we’re not here
i’m just going to keep knocking till you answer knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
what do you want i didn’t say come in
you asked what i wanted i wanted to come in i’m here because you violated our roommate agreement specifically section eight visitors subsection c females paragraph four coitus roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus”
i didn’t even know her 12 hours ago
do i get some sympathy now
a little bit okay let me get this straight you move in with this guy he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this joyce kim and you still stay
actually i couldn’t get too mad at him about joyce kim
well i was doing some government research at the time you know military rocket fuel it’s kind of secret
what does that have to do with joyce kim
as it turns out she was a north korean spy luckily sheldon drove her out before i revealed anything important which i’m not saying i would have
so what that’s it you’ve stayed with sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison
that was part of it the other part is what happened with the elevator
oh yeah i’m wondering about that you said it was working when you moved in
it was but one night sheldon came home from work… flashback the apartment the settee has now appeared leonard howard and raj are playing a video game
hey sheldon this is howard and raj they work at the university too
i’ll get to you later what are you sitting on
i can’t speak for these guys but i’m sitting on my tushie it’s a joke
oh well there were some people on the first floor moving out and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars howard and raj helped me bring it up
but what’s wrong with the furniture we have
they’re lawn chairs and there was no place for company
did it occur to you that was by design
according to the roommate agreement i’m entitled to allocate 50 of the cubic footage of the common areas
but you didn’t notify me by email so this is still a breach
oh you did did you oh drat hoisted by my own spam filter
what am i doing in your spam folder
i put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano entitled this is funny
oh yeah i saw that that was hilarious end of flashback
okay what does all this have to do with the elevator
i’m getting to it back to flashback
i assure you you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an ipod when microsoft comes out with theirs
okay do you have an opinion about everything
and you just assume you’re always right
it’s not an assumption change seats with me
i don’t like this spot i have to keep turning my head
ooh it’s time for babylon 5
we don’t watch babylon 5 in this apartment
because no one likes babylon 5
there you go– three against one
they don’t get a vote it’s one against one and according to the roommate agreement all ties will be settled by me
but i said no to that
and i said yes and i settle all ties change seats with me
there’s a draft on my neck over here
hmm i’m still not comfortable of course there’s too many people here
we can fix that let’s leave
yeah we can go over to my place
wait let me get my jacket
you’re the guy we’re trying to get away from
oh well in that case i don’t need my jacket and for the record the correct syntax is i’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away oh yes this is definitely going to be my spot end of flashback
okay how do you know he said that you left the room
hey do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not
fine go ahead flashback to howard’s bedroom
howard are you having a playdate
i don’t have playdates i have colleagues
do their parents know they’re here
no but if you keep screaming maybe they’ll hear you
she grows any more hair on her face yes
oh man is that a twostage rocket
three i designed the engine myself
cool can it break mach 1
oh probably if i could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on
oh this just might be your lucky day
howard what happened to the oreos i left on the counter
i haven’t seen your oreos just take your bath without them end of flashback
so why was it his lucky day
well it turns out i had a little rocket fuel in the apartment
what were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment
mm joyce kim was kind of curious about what i did for a living and i was going to kind of show it to her it’s not important the point is the guys and i went back to the apartment
are we ever going to get to the elevator
yeah we’re really close uh uh we’re at the apartment flashback
the trick is to mix it into tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8000 kilonewtons of thrust
excuse me but i’ve been working on this a long time trust me it’ll work
you don’t see your mistake do you
this is for a fullscale rocket not a model
okay i’ve had it with you you might be an expert on theoretical physics and sciencefiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch but this is applied physics and when it comes to applied physic… uhoh
a bad thing a very bad thing get the door get the door get the door get the door get the door
give me that takes the rocket fuel puts it in elevator presses button and jumps out
what’d you do that for i had plenty of time elevator explodes
not only did sheldon save my life he didn’t rat me out to the landlord or the police or homeland security
okay so basically you’re the reason i have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day
so i did something stupid i’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger what were you doing seven years ago
excuse me i was in high school studying keeping my nose clean doing volunteer work for the community flashback penny is in her bedroom sitting on the bed with a guy looking at a pregnancy tester
oh ubuntu you are my favourite linuxbased operating system
hello why do i smell methacrylate
oh uh clear nail polish i had a manipedi men can get those anyway i may owe you an apology
i did agree to the thermostat setting and i shouldn’t have tried to change it
that’s not an apology simply an acknowledgement that i was right
never mind okay if i watch some tv
oh so the dialogue offends you
i would hardly call that dialogue
don’t make me turn that flag upside down ’cause you know i’ll do it
okay we’ve got power to the laser
what for it’s not going to rain
i know that but with skin as fair as mine moon burn is a real possibility
one of my best don’t you think
howard do you want to doublecheck the equatorial mount on the laser we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility
you got it oh raj no billions of dollars have gone into inventing the internet and filling it with pictures of naked women so we don’t have to peep through windows
it’s not like that i’m watching someone’s tv the good wife is on i tell you this is my new grey’s anatomy
leonard leonard what is that what is that
relax it’s just a dirty sock
how on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence
sheldon the world is filled with dirty discarded socks
hey you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment penny
i wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing although i suppose the retroreflector left on the moon by neil armstrong does qualify as a shiny object
why don’t you ask her to come up
i don’t know it’s still a little weird since you know…
she didn’t dump me we were just in different places in the relationship
i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location
oh it’s very simple leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me while penny had just moved to the island of byebye
screw you guys i’m gonna go see if she’s home
if it’s not too much trouble i’d like to point this at the moon now
wait a second the good wife is crying something’s very wrong
we’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon
it’s pretty cool we’ve got a twometer parabolic reflector and everything i thought you might want to see it
how can you bounce stuff off the moon there’s no gravity
uh leonard this is zack zack leonard
oh sorry i didn’t know you were busy maybe another time
hey i want to see this laser thing
oh but what about the party
it’s a surprise party doesn’t matter when we get there
okay well yeah come on up so how’d you two guys meet
my company designs the menus for the cheesecake factory
well my dad but me and my sister are vps
i know it sounds easy but there’s a lot of science that goes in designing them
happy now i’m moving the dirty sock
thank you raj keep an eye out for the other one
hey guys this is my friend zack
whoa is that the laser it’s bitchin’
yes in 1917 when albert einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper zur quantentheorie der strahlung his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’
let me explain what we’re doing here um in 1969 the astronauts on apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier
one question how can you be sure it won’t blow up
see now this is a man for penny
uh that’s a great question zack
well it’s not a great question how could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon that’s a great question
don’t worry about the moon we we set our laser to stun
now we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye
right uh yeah funny uh that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer raj get them some glasses
cool it’s gonna be in 3d
preparing to fire laser at the moon
there it is there’s the spike
25 seconds for the light to return that’s the moon we hit the moon
that’s your big experiment all that for a line on the screen
yeah but uh think about what this represents the fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are manmade objects on the moon put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane
i was wrong penny can do better
okay guys thank you it’s been fun
yeah thanks should we invite them to the party
he must be very skilled at coitus
i’m telling you dude the only way to feel better about penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores
the phrase is get back on the horse not whores
no it’s not… never mind he is right though if you want i can turn you on to this great new dating site i found
you sure they say they can find a match for anybody
have they found a match for you
tons i’ve had like eight dates in the last month and twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left
i can’t bring the nitrogen tank down
all right let me restate that it’s very heavy and i don’t want to
thank you lift with your knees not your back good night
you know what would be fun signing sheldon up for online dating
no think about it we make it an experiment like when frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife
he didn’t find a wife they built him a wife out of dead body parts
okay we’ll call that plan b
zack was a perfectly nice guy and then you ruined him
‘cause in the olden days i never would’ve known he was so stupid
come on he wasn’t that stupid
yes he was he thought you were gonna blow up the moon
he spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appeteasers
you have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots now come with me
put on your noisecancelling headphones ’cause it’s gonna get loud
in what universe is this lowpulp good morning penny
what do you have eyes in the back of your head
when one gets beaten up every other day in school one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing incidentally one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one i’m making english muffins would you like an english muffin
fyi my noisecancelling headphones proved ineffective last night
as a native texan i must say i’ve never heard the phrase yeehaw used in quite that context
oh god that i’ve heard on multiple occasions in what universe is that lightly toasted this has to be the worst day of my life good morning leonard
how many times have i asked you not to do that
she returned to her apartment i presume to shower and vomit not necessarily in that order
i wonder why she didn’t say goodbye
are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour
i know i just thought as an outsider you might be able to provide a fresh perspective
i have no difficulty believing you’re not butter
oh hi um i gotta run early shift
okay i’ll walk down with you so last night was fun huh
yeah it must have been i just threw up in my closet
bummer anyway i was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie
oh yeah tonight’s not great for me
doesn’t have to be tonight i’m free pretty much always
leonard last night was a mistake
when you say mistake do you mean a fortunate mistake like the discovery of penicillin
look i’m sorry i was drunk i was lonely i hated zack can we just forget it ever happened
no it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain especially the whole rodeo thing
so that’s it wham bam thank you leonard
look i said i’m sorry can’t u please let it go
how am i supposed to let it go you used me for sex morning mrs gunderson
we finally have proof that aliens walk among us
the dating site matched a woman with sheldon
trust me breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman
i’ll show you a picture of my uncle louie in a bathing suit sometime leonard you gotta see this we found a match for sheldon
great maybe she can have sex with him and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do
do you know what he’s talking about
nope why don’t you ask him
leonard what are you talking about
i don’t want to talk about it
whatever right now dr sheldon cooper has to send an email to his perfect match greetings fellow lifeform…
if she can do it i can do it if she can do it i can do it if she can do it i can do it knocks on door i can’t do it
leonard hofstadter what’re you doing here
uh i know it’s been a while
right right so how you doing
uh not bad you remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything it was just for fun
uh do you uh want to do that again
she didn’t dump me we were just in different places in the relationship
um anyway apparently it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them
let me think about it slams door
uhoh she wants to meet us
yes but him doesn’t even know about her
well him about to find out about her
who’s going to tell whom about what
your surprise confuses me i live here
right so listen what are you doing tomorrow afternoon
it’s a time of day i invented it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening preevning i’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need
right okay what are you doing tomorrow preevning
well tomorrow’s saturday saturday night is laundry night so i’ll be spending the preevning presorting and presoaking
okay what if i were to tell you tomorrow at 4
i would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air exhausted by your constant tomfoolery
but it’s true but wewe put all your vital information into this dating site answered all their questions just like you would and they found a match for you her name is amy farrah fowler
please even assuming you could answer any question the way i would the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum
and that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question what is your attitude towards online dating”
howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo but i said no our sheldon would say hokum
well come on where’s your scientific curiosity
well most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why i’m having this conversation with you
okay how about this even spock had a date once every seven years
he didn’t date it was pon farr his blood boiled with mating lust
okay well why don’t you start with a cup of coffee and you can pon farr amy farrah fowler later
all right you can have a hot chocolate
as i will not be engaging in this nonsense my choice of beverage is moot but for the record i only drink hot chocolate in months with an r in them
sheldon i’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl it will remain there forever
are you willing to risk it
i was a perfectly happy geeky little lonely guy and you ruined me
come on we’re gonna have sex and it’s not gonna mean a thing
are you out of your mind
i’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here
in a few minutes when i gloat over the failure of this enterprise how would you prefer i do it the standard i told you so the classic neenerneener or just my normal look of haughty derision
you don’t know we’re wrong yet
excuse me i’m amy farrah fowler you’re sheldon cooper
hello amy farrah fowler i’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely additionally i’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock
if that was slang i’m unfamiliar with it if it was literal i share your aversion to soiled hosiery in any case i’m here because my mother and i have agreed that i will date at least once a year
interesting my mother and i have the same agreement about church
i don’t object to the concept of a deity but i’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance
well then you might want to avoid east texas
noted now before this goes any further you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table
may i buy you a beverage
good god what have we done
and now the kung pao chicken
and finally my moo shu pork
ah there you have it gentlemen our entire dinner unpacked by robot
and it only took 28 minutes
impressive but we must be cautious
today it’s a chinese food retrieval robot tomorrow it travels back in time and tries to kill sarah connor
i don’t think that’s going to happen sheldon
no one ever does that’s why it happens
hey is the food here ooh what’s that
that dear lady is the wolowitz programmable hand designed for extravehicular repairs on the international space station
ask me to pass the soy sauce
oh does that come up much on the space station
mostly with asian and jewish astronauts
all right pass the soy sauce
oh it’s not bad kind of hungry
you realize penny that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete
really they’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger
i thought you broke up with her why is she here
okay here we go passing the soy sauce put out your hand
i wouldn’t say amazing at best it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us country bear jamboree
yes howard types the hand puts up two fingers to sheldon peace
does nasa know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder
you kidding they still think it’s in a secure locker at jpl
borrowed the trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it
excuse me oh amy’s at the dry cleaners and she’s made a very amusing pun “i don’t care for perchloroethylene and i don’t like glycol ether” get it she doesn’t like glycol ether sounds like either taps in reply lol
how long has this been going on
are you telling me for the past four months i have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with sheldon has a girlfriend
ah dududududu how did they meet
raj and i entered sheldon’s information on a dating site and it spit out amy farrah fowler
oh my god sheldon and amy
or as we call them shamy
shamy i am so digging the shamy
all right everyone pay attention yes i have a friend named amy farrah fowler yes she is female yes we communicate on a daily basis but no she is not my girlfriend
okay well what do you communicate about
well my work in physics her work in neurobiology and most recently the possibility of our having a child together
wait a minute– a child you never see this girl you just email and text and twitter now you’re considering having a baby
amy pointed out that between the two of us our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow
i’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill sheldon
you don’t even like people touching you how are you going to have sex
why on earth would we have sex
oh honey did your mom not have the talk with you you know when your private parts started growing
i’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce which is messy unsanitary and based on living next to you for three years involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity
yes exactly consequently if amy and i choose to bring new life into this world it will be accomplished clinically with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes which reminds me you have broad hips and a certain cornfed vigour is your womb available for rental
look sheldon before you race off to the fertility clinic you might want to think about uh gee i don’t know maybe actually spending some time with her
okay look don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend think of it as uh getting to know the future mother of your child
oh i hadn’t considered that i suppose she will have to have access to our progeny and you don’t think i can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging
huh it would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
you do realize i stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times
i know i can see the shadow of your feet under the door
yeah my point is it’s a waste of time
if you’re looking for an example of a waste of time i would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now
i’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with amy farrah fowler
wait you have to drive me
i did he said and i quote ask penny it was her cockamamie idea
actually i’m paraphrasing having been raised in a christian household i’m uncomfortable with the language he used and to be honest i’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie
hurry we’re going to be late
sheldon did it ever occur to you that i might have other plans
i’m sorry do you have other plans
well no not per se but…
so this conversation is as pointless as your doorknocking soliloquy
let me get my cockamamie keys
oh god that feels so good yeah that’s the spot oh baby
i’ll eat later i’m busy oh yeah just like a real hand hmm
i wish you weren’t wearing flipflops it’s dangerous to drive in flipflops
sorry i just don’t want to be yet another flipflop fatality
can i ask you a question
given your community college education i encourage you to ask me as many as possible
yeah well my question is and i’m pretty sure i know the answer is this your first date
that depends does squaredancing with my sister at a teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown count as a date
then this is my first date
okay well then there’s a couple of things you should probably know
i have a master’s degree and two doctorates the things i should know i do know
my point is i know more about dating than you and if you were as smart as you think you are you would listen to me
if you know so much how come i have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it
you know there’s something i’ve always wondered about aquaman
what would a toilet look like in atlantis how would you flush it and when you did flush it where would the poop go
hold that thought hey howard what’s going on what hold on howard howard slow down the robot hand is stuck on your what to raj you’re not going to believe this
so um amy sheldon tells me you’re a neuro somethingorother
neurobiologist your check engine light is on
don’t bother i’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill
um what is that scent you’re wearing it smells great
dandruff shampoo i have dry scalp
ah well your hair looks very nice
no no i was just giving you a compliment
hmm would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual
oh no i wouldn’t care for that amy
okay uncomfortable silence it is hey sheldon have you told amy what it was like for you growing up in texas
well why don’t you tell her
i myself grew up in nebraska small town outside of omaha you know nice place mostly family farms a few meth labs
i’m sorry how is this better than uncomfortable silence
i don’t know i was just trying something
you slipped and fell into a robot hand
i’d suggest a lubricant but i have a feeling you fell on some of that as well
really a robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk dude that’s funny ask anyone
please before my mother walks in just get this off me
no no don’t touch the program is paused
no no i loaded the wrong program the hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space if you continue the program it’s gonna start twisting
aall right um how about this when when winnie the pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled
you do what you want i’m not touching another man’s honey tree
all right uh forget pulling how about we get an electric saw and cut it off
what no saws one circumcision was enough
okay i can’t believe this needs to be said out loud no pulling no saws no torches
well then what do you want us to do
howard i made cookies for you and your little friends
i’ll bring them up with some hawaiian punch
why not are you ashamed of your mother
yes but that’s not the point get me out of here
right now all i can think about is cookies and hawaiian punch
hey here’s another possible topic of conversation this is a big night for sheldon right sheldon
big night the winter solstice is a big night it’s over 14 hours in southern california
no no my point is uh tonight is sheldon’s first official date discuss
apparently a semiincestuous teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown didn’t count
so um amy what about you do you date much
once a year it’s a deal i made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter as well as the occasional use of her george foreman grill that seals in the flavour without the fat how about you penny do you go on many dates
uh yeah i wouldn’t say many a few sheldon laugh’s strangely what’s imitates sheldon’s laugh
your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few
what where did you get 171 men
simple extrapolation in the three years that i’ve known you you were single for two during that time i saw 17 different suitors if we work backwards correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…
whoa wait wait wait i did not start dating at 15
my mistake now assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present that would bring the total up to 193 men plus or minus eight men
remarkable did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men
although that number would be fairly easy to calculate
based on the number of awkward encounters i’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…
okay sheldon i think you’ve made your point
so we multiply 193 minus 21 men before the loss of virginity so 172 times 018 gives us 3096 sexual partners let’s round that up to 31
okay sheldon you are so wrong that is not even close to the real number i’m gonna need a drink over here
this is very interesting cultural perceptions are subjective penny to your mind are you a slut
no no no let’s just all finish our dinners okay
this is an interesting topic how many sexual encounters have you had
does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count
next time take your own advice
excuse me could you help us out
my my my what do we have here
yeah we get that a lot what is this
where’s the rest of the robot
‘cause that’s all you needed right
can you please just help me
all right all right hang on stay calm over pa system  i need an orderly with a wheelchair i got a robot hand grasping a man’s penis out here
you think you could be a little more discreet
i’m sorry we don’t have a code for robot hand grasping a man’s penis why is it hooked up to a computer
uh it’s what controls the arm
did you try turning it off and back on again
no you see it’s more complicated than that nurse switches off computer no wait the hand lets go winnie the pooh is out of the honey tree
now can we have cookies and hawaiian punch
you were right this was a very productive evening i saw a whole new side of amy farrah fowler tonight
i did not have sex with 31 guys
i’ll be happy to check the math but numbers don’t lie penny in any event now that amy and i have spent quality time together i feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship
using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny
in these uncertain times doesn’t humanity deserve a gift
okay you know what i’m gonna come at this in a whole new way sheldon if you try to make a baby with amy in a petri dish i’m gonna tell your mother on you
that’s no threat my mother’s always wanted a grandchild
really your deeply religious bornagain christian mother wants a testtube grandbaby born out of wedlock
if i’d thought of that in the first place i could’ve saved myself this whole night
well it’s not that late you could still go out and look for number 32 good night
yeah yeah great howard uh slow down what do you mean it happened again
whatcha doin’ there working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner
the humorous implication being that i am wile e coyote
and this is a schematic for a birdtrapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury
what i’m doing here is trying to determine when i’m going to die
a lot of people are working on that research so what is all this
my family history factoring in longevity propensity for disease et cetera
interesting cause of death for uncle carl was kbb what’s kbb
it was thanksgiving uncle carl said i think there’s a badger living in our chimney hand me that flashlight those were the last words he ever spoke to us
i don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary
not true the fight or flight instinct is coded genetically instead of fleeing he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family who’s to say that i don’t share that flawed dna
you can always get a badger and find out
but seriously even if i disregard the uncle carl factor at best i have 60 years left
60 only takes me to here i need to get to here
the earliest estimate of the singularity when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality
so you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish selfaware robot
you don’t get it leonard i’m going to miss so much the unified field theory  cold fusion the dogapus
a hybrid dog and octopus man’s underwater best friend
i was going to i planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday
wait a minute you hate dogs
a dogapus can play fetch with eight balls no one can hate that
it came to 2817 let’s say six bucks apiece
oh you wanted me to pay
no no no no you’re right we’re not going out anymore i should pay for myself after raj whispers to howard and howard laughs what
he said if he had woman parts he’d eat for free the rest of his life
yeah but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself i’m a little low on cash
how can you walk around with no money
it’s okay you can owe me
no thank you i’m not eating pizza tonight
but it’s thursday thursday’s pizza night
not for me thursday is now cruciferous vegetable night tonight’s selection brussels sprouts
really you’re changing the sheldonian calendar
it’s a small price to pay
in order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics i need to change my diet
wait cybernetics is robot stuff right
so you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot
okay here’s my question didn’t you already do that
flattering but sadly no i’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system aka jogging
wait honeyhave you ever run before
certainly i’ve run from bullies dogs angry chickens and one particularly persistent pe teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test
you’re right penny jogs maybe you guys can run together
that’s an excellent idea yeah if we chat it will create the illusion of time going faster
no it won’t um how does he know i jog
oh he watches you from his car with highpowered binoculars
oh my god that is so creepy
i know raj whispers to him and he says he’s not gonna stop raj whispers to him urgently then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women
knock knock knock ugh knock knock knock uuugh knock knock knock lenuuugh
what the hell what’s the matter
i have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen i’m nauseated and feverish i believe i may have cholera
there’s no cholera in pasadena just like last summer when there was no malaria in pasadena
well if it’s not cholera then based on a quick internet search the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are hirschsprung’s disease botulism a 30foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms
when would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms
it’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24hour flower mart with a lessthanvigilant proprietor oh lord my belly
have you had your appendix out
i haven’t i’ve been meaning to but who has the time
let’s get you to the hospital
so this is how it ends with cruel irony just as i make the commitment to preserving my body i am betrayed by my appendix a vestigial organ do you know the original purpose of the appendix leonard
i do and yet i’m doomed while you live on
funny how things work out isn’t it
oh lord i think it’s about to burst loud sound of farting on the other hand it might have been the brussels sprouts
good night appendicitis what a nervous nelly
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
oh and the flash shirt is what because you’re gonna run really fast
no the flash shirt is because it’s friday but it’s nice when things work out where’s your heart rate monitor
do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an ipod
what do you do you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny
no i just run till i’m hungry then i stop for a bear claw
it’s good to stretch your muscles before you run
all right let’s start with a toe touch okay you do it
oh wow good job okay um can you do this
okay let’s just warm up on the run
yeah i’ve been reading up on biomechanics i think you’ll be surprised at my… wah oh
oh my god are you okay
oh let me help you up
thank you loud sound of farting
if it makes you feel any better thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable night
here’s my chicken curry howard your shrimp biryani
and for rajesh koothrappali from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate one large order of chicken mcnuggets
okay can i get you after friday when i get paid
what am i up to now
well okay with the indian food the pizza the thai food the tank of gas the frozen yogurt and your rent uh a little over fourteen hundred dollars
he’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff
it’s not free i’m gonna pay him back raj whispers both laugh again shut up
sheldon are you gonna join us
coming from the bedroom area a wheeled device consisting of a base a teeshirt on a coat hanger and a computer monitor with sheldon’s face appears greetings friends
greetings whatever the hell you are
i am a mobile virtual presence device recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world until such time as i am able to transfer my consciousness i shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner
really that’s your question when did he put a ramp in
you’re in my spot this may seem a little odd at first but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration
yeah to be honest i don’t see much difference
thank you that’s what i was going for now leonard tomorrow when we go to work you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs for your convenience i disassemble into four pieces
this is ridiculous i’m coming to talk to you
you don’t know where i am my physical body is safely ensconced in a secure undisclosed location
i can hear your voice coming from your bedroom
no you can’t wait come back halt authorized personnel only
so either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear only fourteen hundred bucks
i’m behind you please look at me when you’re talking to me
no you’re not pay no attention to that man in the bed
you cannot exist as a virtual presence not here and certainly not at work oh good god
at my age do you know how i’m statistically most likely to die
at the hands of your roommate
that’s how i’m going to make it look
until i can transfer my intellect to a more durable container my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed
fine but don’t expect my help
you have to help it’s in the roommate agreement
section 74c the various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot
it’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death
refresh my memory why didn’t i just put you in the trunk
you seem tense perhaps this will relax you
i don’t want to listen to music sheldon
very well i don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this together in this car with my enhanced capabilities we’re like knight rider
except in knight rider the car isn’t a yammering sphincter
you mock the sphincter but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive there are over 50 different sphincters in the human body how many can you name
i was wrong this is exactly like knight rider
perhaps you’d be interested in a different game
this is a photograph of the 1911 solvay conference on the theory of radiation and quanta using photoshop i’ve introduced a few anachronisms see if you can spot all 24 i’ll give you the first one madame curie should not be wearing a digital watch and go

i say we just take him to tatooine and sell him to some jawas

oh great hi i’m penny i’ll be your waitress

soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur
no you have to start over
soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr
all right i’m ready for my next question
in a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets who wins the second world war
kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses a central african power block is formed colonizing north africa and europe when war breaks out no one can afford the luxury of a rhino kenya withers uganda triumphs
in a world where a piano is a weapon not a musical instrument on what does scott joplin play the maple leaf rag
what the hell are you guys playing
it’s a game we invented it’s called counterfactuals
we postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other
it’s fun for ages eight to eighty join us
all right i like a good brainteaser give it a whirl
you’re in luck this is an easy one in a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver what food is no longer consumed
uh a blt where the b stands for beaver i don’t know
leonard be serious we’re playing a game here
i can figure this out let’s see um well beavers eat tree bark the only tree bark i know that humans consume is cinnamon so i’ll say cinnamon
incorrect obviously the answer is cheese danish
in a world ruled by a giant beaver mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord the lowlying city of copenhagen is flooded thousands die devastated the danes never invent their namesake pastry how does one miss that
this is ridiculous you’re just making stuff up
is he always like this when he loses
oh yes you should’ve been here for the great jenga tantrum of 2008
you bumped the table and you know it
perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities we’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide
very good leonard but next time don’t tell us where you’re hiding
did you guys see the paper in the american physics journal on supersolids it’s pretty interesting this guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
don’t ruin it for me man i printed out a pdf to read on the potty
on the potty what are you five
it’s a potty what do you call it
that’s a little vulgar for the dinner table don’t you think
potty is innocent potty is adorable
what do you do in the potty weewee
if i don’t have to boomboom
greetings you all remember amy farrah fowler
i must take responsibility i had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies
i believe she’s experiencing her menses
actually i’m not in order to avoid surprises i wear them all the time
okay toilet’s sounding pretty good now huh
a juvenile amalgamation of our names sheldon and amy  shamy
oh i don’t like that don’t do that
well just recently i learned that you refer to us as shamy and i don’t like that
i got it but what i was going for was you know how’s your life
like everybody else’s subject to entropy decay and eventual death thank you for asking why is she not taking our order
i should’ve warned you one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here
really i assumed an establishment called the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently
it’s how they lure you in i believe it’s called bait and switch
okay i’m just gonna walk away ’cause i don’t want to be here
so this is nice first time we’ve all gotten together to eat
you’re right he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat
okay that’s all i got howard you’re up
um tell us about your work amy
i doubt you’d understand sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree
raj do you have any questions for amy
i’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone
they can’t function without me i’m the social glue that holds this little group together you’re welcome
listen can i talk to you about your girlfriend
she’s not my girlfriend she’s a girl and she’s my friend but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva
although for the record on one occasion she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth it’s an action we both regret to this day
uhhuh anyway i’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little how should we call it rebel alliance
oh i never identified with the rebel alliance despite their tendency to build death stars i’ve always been more of an empire man
i know what your point is you’re intimidated by amy’s intellect to that i say buck up
okay let me just get right to it amy is judgmental sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious
so we already have you for all that
are you suggesting i terminate my relationship with amy
no no of course not just have your relationship someplace else
may i point out that for eight long months i suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her offkey country music caterwauling the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room and night after night of uninformative tv documentaries about the jersey shore
yes and i’d thank you to do the same
ah nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear rocky mountain spring water where are the rocky mountains anyway
really i thought they were out west someplace
think about it raj where did the movie rocky take place
philadelphia okay now i get it
so this is the plan from now on we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the shamy
i’m very comfortable here penny dear why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way
ooh somebody’s been taking bitchy pills
god he’s an ass when he drinks
oh he’s an ass when he doesn’t you just don’t hear it
i think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the shamy could go on for years
well if that’s the case penny will have to get satellite tv and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place
i thought you were going to talk to sheldon
well he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to put up with you
i tried but penny starts rubbing her foot with a pumice stone he made a fairly wellreasoned argument
i do this for my mom all the time see with the grain
and someday when you have varicose veins i’ll show you how to massage them
i assume by never again you mean never again will you drink all of penny’s beer then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s a box of slim jims and the latest issue of bombay badonkadonks
the highlight of the evening was when you showed us your bollywood break dancing skills does a stereotyped impersonation of bollywood dancing
i brought amy here to show her some of the work i’m doing
it’s very impressive for theoretical work
do i detect a hint of condescension
i’m sorry was i being too subtle i meant compared to the realworld applications of neurobiology theoretical physics is what’s the word i’m looking for hmm cute
are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarkemaxwell or dirac
i’m stating it outright babinski eats dirac for breakfast and defecates clarkemaxwell
absolutely not my colleagues and i are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing which is required for all cognitive reasoning including scientific inquiry making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi that means it’s better than his research and by extension of course yours
i’m sorry i’mi’m still trying to work on the defecating clark maxwell so…
excuse me but a grand unified theory insofar as it explains everything will ipso facto explain neurobiology
yes but if i’m successful i will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory and therefore subsume your conclusions under my paradigm
that’s the rankest psychologism and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by gottlob frege in the 1890s
we appear to have reached an impasse
i agree i move our relationship terminate immediately
the motion carries good day amy farrah fowler
women huh can’t live with them can’t successfully refute their hypotheses
i hear you broke up with amy
a breakup would imply she was my girlfriend she was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend
wow that’s like the worst country song ever so how are you doing
well breakups or whatever the hell this is can be tough
penny i assure you i’m fine my relationship with amy was purely intellectual there were no emotional bonds the severing of which would cause me any discomfort the relationship simply outlived its utility and i’m continuing on with my life as before
now if you’ll excuse me i’m off to buy a pussycat
i gotta tell you guys i’m a little worried about sheldon
we’re all a little worried about sheldon
no i mean since the shamy hit a reef
oh i thought you were just making a generalization you know i’m worried about sheldon someday setting off a lowyield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime jello
what does hit a reef mean
i think sheldon really misses amy
you should lend him your copy of bombay badonkadonks
he got a cat to keep him company
he takes it everywhere to bed to the bathroom
he takes the kitty to the potty
i thought we discussed the pword
don’t try to change me dude i am what i am
hey aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend
my apologies raj howard i’d like you to meet dr robert oppenheimer
now if you’ll excuse me the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk
okay i get it we’re worried about sheldon
hey turns to see sheldon now has five cats oh no
so you decided to get the whole manhattan project
yes this is enrico fermi richard feynman edward teller otto frisch and zazzles
i was going to name him herman von helmholtz but he’s so zazzy
cats sheldon you’re clearly upset about amy being gone and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats
a group of cats is a clowder or a glaring
it’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one
terrific mymy point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup
it wasn’t a breakup a breakup would imply that amy was my girlfriend
okay i got it i got it she’s not your girlfriend now listen to me i know about loneliness i know about trying to replace someone with other stuff when i broke up with penny i got back into my cello i built a bunch of model rockets i got those weightlifting gloves and that fivepound dumbbell
you didn’t break up she dumped you
she didn’t dump me it was mutual
i was there she dumped you
okay fine live with cats be like my aunt nancy she had dozens of them and do you know what happened after she died they ate her
you don’t have to sell me on cats leonard i’m already a fan all right fellas who’s in the mood for fancy feast well that’s not fancy at all
hi mrs cooper thanks for coming
now when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl you meant an actual girl not something you kids whipped up in a lab
no no it’s not like that it’s uh i don’t know what it’s like but there is something i should prepare you for
oh relax leonard i have raised that boy i’ve seen him at his best i’ve seen him at his worst there’s nothing he can do that’ll surprise me
hold on to that thought knocks on sheldon’s bedroom door
come in they enter the room is full of cats
my my that’s a powerful smell
i’d like you to meet oppenheimer frisch panofsky feynman weisskopf…
yeah i get it you got a lot of cats and you gave ’em cute jewish names
leonard called and he said that you were pining for a young lady
oh that’s preposterous i’m not pining over anyone
oh lambchop we can quibble what to call it but i think we can both agree it’s creepy
i do not agree cats make wonderful companions they don’t argue or question my intellectual authority and this little guy here i think you’ll find to be quite zazzy
awenters to find amy what is she doing here
your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me as a neurobiologist i was curious
well rest assured i am in full possession of my faculties
oh god bless you dear sheldon sit down let’s talk
all right but you’re not fooling me whenever you say we have to talk it means you want me to listen
now the reason i called amy over was to find out what type of person she is and after chatting a bit i have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman you two are definitely not suited for each other
that’s a peculiar conclusion by any standard amy is more similar to me than anyone i’ve ever met
oh i’m sorry shelly i can’t see it
well whether you see it or not is irrelevant i can’t see subatomic particles but nevertheless they’re there
well putting aside the pig latin it’s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so i didn’t have to end it for you
amy after consideration i believe we may have acted rashly i propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences
i’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80 of our difficulties were caused by you
i’ll go as high as 40
done you understand that moving forward we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you
i do i find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating
would you like to see my cats
i would i love cats they’re the epitome of indifference
ah then you may find zazzles a little cloying
i saw what you did there
he thinks he’s such a smarty pants he’s no different from any man you tell ’em not to do something that’s all they want to do if i hadn’t told my brother stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand we’d still be calling him edward now don’t you move i’ll bring over all the food
no no no i can do it
thank you amy here’s your cat and here’s your 20
thank you amy here’s your cat and here’s your 20
i’m telling you if xenon emits ultraviolet light then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong
yes well if we lived in a world where slowmoving xenon produced light then you’d be correct also pigs would fly my derriere would produce cotton candy and the phantom menace would be a timeless classic
oh you’re so arrogant if you were a superhero your name would be captain arrogant and you know what your superpower would be arrogance
you’re wrong again if my superpower were arrogance my name would be dr arroganto
i love watching raj and sheldon try to work together
yeah it’s like if alien and predator decided to go partners in a jamba juice
has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture if you look at neutron scattering data…
nothing i just wanted to make raj stop talking
no no no he won suck it up
well i’d ask you guys if you want dessert but i know sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on tuesdays and even if raj wanted something he couldn’t tell me howard won’t order anything but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake and leonard’s lactose intolerant so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal
hang on a second i could have the fruit platter
does it have melon on it
oh howard heads up your exgirlfriend just came in for her shift
when was the last time you saw her
oh not since we broke up wow how am i going to play this sophisticated and relaxed friendly noncommittal cold and distant hides under table
hello i see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened
it’s one of his best moves
so my dear we meet again
why am i wearing my battlestar galactica flight suit in bed
why are you in bed with me if we start to question this it all falls apart
sorry oh ravish me howard my loins ache for you
howard have you seen my girdle
i can’t find it and i’m late for my weight watchers meeting
maybe it committed suicide leave me alone now where were we
i believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth
bernadette what are you doing here
well if i had to guess i’d say i’m here because you saw me earlier this evening and you’re still hung up on me
clearly you are otherwise based on past experience we’d be done by now
okay i’m a little confused here
howard do you have latent homosexual tendencies
so you say yet here i am
george let me ask you something how did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon
it’s difficult you try and stretch as an actor do strindberg o’neill but all they want is course laid in captain
tell me about it it’s frackin’ frustrating
wait katee why are you leaving
she’s leaving because you really want to be with me
howard i found my girdle it was in the dryer
i think it shrunk i’m spilling out like the pillsbury doughboy here
and with that mental picture i think we’re done for the evening
you know you never told me what happened between you and bernadette
it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now
that covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy oh my god you ran over a hobo
all right fine so you want to get back together with her but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did
okay well how about this kidnap bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you
now you see i don’t know if you’re kidding or not
you’re being unreasonable why can’t i have a desk
our collaboration is a work of the mind we don’t need desks
why can’t he have a desk sheldon
oh lord will this day never end as i’ve explained repeatedly to dr koothrappali whose ability to comprehend the american idiom fails him when it’s convenient there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture
oh but there’s money for a drawer full of red vines a marshmallow shooting rifle and a super executive ant farm with glowinthedark sand
okay what if he buys his own desk
yeah what if i buy my own desk
all right all right he can buy his own desk
and i can put it in your office
well you really want to dot the i’s and cross the t’s don’t you
why would you want a glowinthedark ant farm
they do some of their best work at night
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny penny opens door howard is stood outside with a handheld voice recorder penny
would you have opened the door if you knew it was me
not since i found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it
i just have a question does bernadette ever talk about me
yeah sure just yesterday she asked why is howard hiding under the table
oh no not at first right after i pointed it out
let me ask you something else is she seeing anybody
uh not that i know of hey while we’re on the subject why did you guys break up anyway
howard if you want my help i’ve got to know what happened
yeah that’s what i’m counting on spill
okay well you know world of warcraft
well did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other
oh god i think i see where this is going
her name was glissinda the troll bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cybernasty under the bridge of souls
oh you’re right that is so embarrassing
bernadette she was so mad at me she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story
well for all we know glissinda the troll wasn’t even a real woman i mean she could’ve been a 50yearold truck driver in new jersey
really and that didn’t make her feel better
will you talk to her see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together
oh gee howard i really don’t want to get in the middle of this
no why would you i’m just another lonely nerd living with his mother trying to find any scrap of happiness he can you know maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11
okay i will think about it
you know i’ve always blamed myself for him leaving i always thought it was because i wasn’t the son he wanted
yeah i said i’d think about it
i wasn’t athletic yeah i was kind of sickly
okay fine look look i’m calling her now see
so anyway howard asked penny to talk to bernadette and she did and bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee
why on earth are you telling me all this
i don’t know sometimes your movements are so lifelike i forget you’re not a real boy
you said i could buy a desk
this isn’t a desk this is a brobdingnagian monstrosity
is that the american idiom for giant bigass desk
can you say it again for me
brobdingnagian brobdingna… how did you even get it in here
that’s for me ramon julio jesus and rodrigo to know and you to find out
all right you’ve made your point a fine prank very amusing now get it out
i have three brothers and two sisters sheldon i can do this all day
all right if you’re not going to remove it i’ll remove it for you
why do you even want this here its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose
well seeing as its purpose was to piss you off i’d say it’s spoton
all right i see what’s going on this is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile titfortat exchanges well titted
stand by for my upcoming tat
no see what i did there i turned it around
sorry i had to clock out
oh no that’s okay how have you been
okay you know busy school work you
same i took a scubadiving course over the summer but it turns out i’m terrified of the ocean
you wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit boy’s large yeah forget it not important so are you seeing anyone
hey how are we doing over here can i get you something to drink
are you gonna want to order food
that’s what i told him when he asked me i hope that’s not out of line
penny can we have a little privacy
what about you have you been seeing anybody
well you know how it is with guys i mean we have needs and…
so you’ve been seeing other girls
you know you look thirsty i brought you some iced tea
it’s passion fruit new on the menu
oh sorry yeah you’re right doy so howard trolls yay or nay
isn’t there somewhere else you can be
not where i can hear you guys
okay fine i’ll admit there are dark sordid little corners of the internet where the name wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones but the only reason i go there the only reason i’ve ever gone there is because i don’t have a real woman in my life you happy
yeah that’ll hold me for a while
howard you did have a real woman i was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out
yeah but we weren’t ii mean you and i never…
complimentary nachos you enjoy never had sex wow
what do you mean whose fault was that
well we could’ve been having sex but you never made the move
i didn’t think you wanted me to make the move
howard a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you with your looks your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move
hey this is a little awkward but my manager says i can’t actually give nachos away so just take that when you’re ready
yeah we had a really great talk and we’re gonna start seeing each other again
oh congratulations have you broken it to the troll yet
did penny tell you about that
the greasy old fat guy in facilities management
sorry dude the thermostat’s on my side of the room so it stays mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid indian music
i’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonellaridden parakeet
oh too bad sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds hey look sheldon birdie birdie birdie
that’s it prepare for marshmallow death
so anyway that’s great news about you and bernadette
yeah i think i’m gonna take her to miniature golf
ah well i guess for you guys that’s like regular golf
short jokes really you’re like a quarter of an inch taller than me
yeah and don’t you forget it
kiss her good night all right now a little tongue
hold on there we’ve only just rekindled the romance let’s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva
don’t listen to him she wants it tongue luhluhluhluhluh see now make the move
trust me she’s ready make the move
no no no a lady wants to be wooed courted slowly
listen to me howard it’s time make the move now
you said well the move remember
oh not now we’re starting a new relationship i need to get to know you again
no you don’t it’s me the lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants
oh god what’s that smell knocks on sheldon’s door sheldon answers in a gas mask ohhohoo
what are you doing in there
i’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas just a little experiment in pest control
it’s not gonna work dude i grew up in india an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement
well we’ll just see how long you can hold out
well we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamonapplescented aroma therapy candles
didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas
all i’m saying is if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent hulk movie they could probably just make an actual hulk
that is apt and amusing i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler she’ll appreciate the witticism
it’ll also help improve her initial impression of you
so what’s going on with you two
well the status is as it always was she’s a girl she’s a friend she is not my please forgive me for doing this girlfriend
right right so you’re still just texting and emailing you don’t feel any need to hang out with her you know be in the same room
leonard you are my best friend i’ve known you for seven years and i can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to amy farrah fowler
i sense judgment on your part
may i suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy
jealousy what do i have to be jealous of
i have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female you have none
jealousy is an ugly greeneyed monster not unlike the hulk who by the way also has a girlfriend in this iteration jennifer connelly whom you may recall as the girlfriend of russell crowe in a beautiful mind a feelgood romp if there ever was one
you know it just occurred to me if there are an infinite number of parallel universes in one of them there’s probably a sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist
no point it’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle what makes you chuckle leonard
is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pairbond with a woman and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity
you know when my grandfather died and meemaw was alone my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people it’s very nice they discuss current events play bridge get a hot meal
it is if you like bridge do you like bridge leonard
sheldon i’m just not dating someone right now i don’t need to go to a senior centre
meemaw resisted at first but now she loves it
fine if i don’t meet someone soon you can put me in a home
it’s not a home it’s a senior centre  we’d never put meemaw in a home
all right i’ll bow to social pressure hey
excuse me that’s my girlfriend bernadette i assigned her her own ringtone bernadette by the four tops hello bernadette
when i call him his phone plays brown eyed girl which now that i think about it is not so good
you realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend and we don’t
you have a girlfriend how could you have a girlfriend you can’t even speak to women
two words deaf chick it doesn’t matter if i can’t talk because she can’t hear me
great you have a girlfriend howard’s got a girlfriend sheldon’s got a girl…
what about you stuart you have a girlfriend yet
oh yeah yeah i met her at comiccon the one place in the world where saying i own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line
not really she’s horrible when she wants to have sex she puts on her plussize wonder woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane
why don’t you just break up with her
‘cause then i’d be alone like you
dude why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with wolowitz
because i don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends i’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own
oh leonard you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free
you’re saying i couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons
are you going to let me tell the story or not
are you still depressed because you’re alone and no one loves you
i want you to know that i’m genuinely concerned about your wellbeing
you’re welcome but it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot
what the hell how long has she been here
since we got home from the comic bookstore
as per your suggestion we’re hanging out quite frankly i don’t see what all the hoopla’s about go on amy
from a neurobiological standpoint leonard you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromonebased stink of desperation
i understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns have you tried a bar or tavern
no i’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar
wise decision you see amy success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height strength attractiveness the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts separately or together leonard has none of these attributes right leonard
that’s not true of all bars juice bars for example
oh good point amy yeah building on your premise leonard could frequent sushi bars salad bars oyster bars the apple genius bar what are you doing
he does it all the time he’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness
let’s make that our word of the day
agreed and we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow
well i have to void my bladder it was nice spending this time with you
i’d like you to meet my mother
i see can i get back to you on that
good night closing laptop and running down stairs in panic leonard leonard leonard
amy farrah fowler has asked me to meet her mother
well you know how you’re always saying that amy is a girl who’s your friend and not your girlfriend
look she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level
i don’t want the next level i like this level fix it for me
me well how am i supposed to fix it
simple you want a girlfriend amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend take her off my hands i give you my blessing
you’re right it would never work amy finds you tedious
wait what am i supposed to do
well have you considered telling her how you feel
leonard i’m a physicist not a hippie
all right well let me see if i can explain your situation using physics what would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis
you know i’m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy i’m like an upsidedown volcano here
oh hey i hope you didn’t hear that
what’s with the tshirt you working at the apple store now
no it’s just something i threw on
i know all your shirts that’s not one of them you were pretending to work at the genius bar to pick up women weren’t you
yeah turns out they guard the ipods but they don’t guard the shirts
it was going well i was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in safe mode the manager got suspicious and well long story short they really do have a little jail in the mall
just fyi don’t try to go back with a fake moustache i mean they may not really be geniuses but they see right through that
i want to invoke the girlfriend pact howard
no i just i want what you have you know i want a woman in my life
holy moses how much liquid can be in one tukus
to be clear i meant like bernadette not your mother
yeah i know what you mean
well i’m off to meet bernadette’s friend how do i look
as if one of the plants from invasion of the body snatchers duplicated you in every way only with an absurd amount of hair gel
i’m removing my digital footprint from the internet so amy farrah fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother
ah you’re going off the grid
thank you i’ve also sent amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and email address
what if she just comes over
she’ll get lost we no longer live at 2311 los robles we now live at 311 los robles
you changed the address on the building what about mail
oh no worries i explained my predicament to our letter carrier he was sympathetic his exact words were got your back jack bitches be crazy
the only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan now get my back jack
what do you want to do
i don’t know you’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details
way to go on the details
thanks again for doing this bernadette
oh i take pacts very seriously one time at my lab a petri dish of genetically modified supervirus went missing that day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed ebola with the common cold
why the hell would you cross ebola with the common cold
we never did that would be a terrible terrible thing
hi sorry i’m late i was at the gym spin class worked up quite a sweat
joy this is leonard leonard this is joy
hi you don’t look like a genius go ahead say something smart
aah time’s up just kidding first thing you need to know about me i’m hilarious
yeah so bernadette tells me she knows you from selfdefence classes
yeah israeli krav maga lots of fun basically a hundred different ways to rip a guy’s nuts off
wow wouldn’t think there’d be that many
proxima centauri’s the nearest star the celestial bodies that follow are alpha centauri a toli barnard’s star wolf 359 lalande 21185 sirius a sirius b blceti uvceti ross 154 ross 248 epsilon eridani lac9352 ross 128 procyon a oh darn that’s wrong heads back up stairs ez aquarii a ez aquarii b ez aquarii c procyon a those are the stars that are nearest to me tralala and fiddledeedee sees amy standing in lobby oh dear they really do be crazy

excuse me i have to go to the little girls’ room and take a wicked whiz
fair warning i had the asparagus my pee is gonna stink up the place
ez aquarii b ez aquarii c excuse me madam
i believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when i asked you to meet my mother
no misunderstanding i’ve learned what that request actually means and i don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis
in what way are you screwed all i want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that i’m in a relationship
so we’d be perpetrating a ruse
and you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me
don’t be absurd i find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships
amy farrah fowler that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me
i trust this clarification allows us to return to boyslashfriendslashgirlslashfriend status
of course would you like to join me for chinese food
come on just give her a chance maybe she’ll grow on you
or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off there are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet look howard i appreciate the effort but this is like the worst date of my life
seriously i was once robbed by a preop transsexual i met on jdate and that didn’t even crack my top ten
i guess the difference is i have some selfrespect
it’s relatively new i just know that i’m not gonna spend time with someone i don’t like simply to have a girlfriend i’m okay on my own
good news i made lots of room for dessert
look uh joy it was nice to meet you but…
yeah you too hey you got anything for next weekend i need a date for my cousin’s wedding
yeah and it’s an open bar so i’ll probably be giving it away
it’s nice to meet you too sheldon i honestly didn’t believe amy when she told me she had a boyfriend
i assure you i am quite real and i’m having regular intercourse with your daughter
oh yes we’re like wild animals in heat it’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt
you wanted me to have a boyfriend mother well here he is have to sign off now my hunger for sheldon is stirring in my loins
oh yes it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina
thank you sheldon that went very well
agreed amy i find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship bazinga bedtime please show yourself out
this is the worst cobbler i’ve ever eaten i mean it tastes like it was made of actual groundup shoemaker
amusing a play on the two meanings of cobbler
hey guys guess who i found at lax my baby sister priya
excuse me i object you propose a guessing game yet you don’t give me enough time to guess for the record i was going to say your sister priya
oh sheldon you haven’t changed a bit have you
the hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion so priya what brings you back to la
i have a one day layover on my way to toronto corporate merger
can you believe it little priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in india
given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large indian car company it’s actually extremely plausible
and your poll numbers just keep dropping
i want to catch up with all of you but first i really must visit the loo
i’m going too i’ll show you where it is
alright this goes without saying but i’m just going to say it anyway hands off my sister
why would i touch her she’s covered with airplane germs
i’m so not talking to you i’m talking to him
hey i’ve got a girlfriend now
oh please my sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it
let’s just agree they’re both hot
dude that’s my sister you’re talking about
okay forget who’s hotter the first time priya came to la leonard and i made a pact out of respect to our friendship and to you that neither of us would hit on her
it’s really nice to see you again leonard
yeah it’s good to see you too here you go
thanks grabs him and kisses him
so you got any special plans with your sister
oh not really just hang out
i always tell people if you have only one day in los angeles make it a train day
the fun starts with brunch at carney’s in studio city a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car next stop travel town an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s finally we’re off to the glitz and glamour of hollywood for dinner at that’s right the hollywood carney’s a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car
i don’t think we’re going to do that
well then apparently you hate fun
hmm priya’s not back yet well i guess that’s not unusual women men the whole sitting standing deal so what are we talking about
did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands
i guess he just hates fun
okay so what’s new with you guys
yeah i just wanna put it out there in case i inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction happy raj nods
so uh priya what are your plans while you’re here
i don’t know i just have the one day
you might as well just wait at the airport for your flight
you are in a forest there is quicksand to the west a path leads to the east go east an iron gate blocks your way open gate it’s locked hmm well so much for that
it’s getting pretty late how come you’re still up
i’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s
oh yes it runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip imagination
you’ve really got to get out more
go north you can’t go that way go west a troll blocks your passage okay fasten your seatbelts kill troll with what with sword there is a knock on the door you don’t have the sword good golly it’s as if it’s actually happening to me
yeah well kissing her sheldon’s still up
you said he goes to bed at nine
yeah he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
hit troll with axe hit troll with axe hit troll with axe oh my this is one tough troll
can’t you get rid of him
if the past is any indication no
leonard i’m trapped in quicksand the axe is dragging me down
hold on i have to figure out how to get the bucket so i can carry the mud past the dragon
sheldon you need to work in the morning
really you’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar you know what happens when you yawn in public
everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula
you don’t want that do you
no but it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated who was at the door
oh uh building manager they have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two
that’s unacceptable we’re supposed to be given written notice
no no it doesn’t matter we’ll be at work
well what if i spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak
i’ll have the chicken noodle goodnight
we’re going to have to be very quiet
i know how to get the bucket i can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it let’s see go north you are in a forest go north you are in a forest go north you are in a forest oh dear i believe i’m lost well i’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow
no no no no no you just need you just need you just need to map it out come on i’ll help you so uh you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times
you’re right you’re lost good luck
i don’t know when i’m in bed with a girl it’s just it’s my go to response
it’s six o’ clock i have to get back to raj’s before he wakes up and realises i’m gone
oh right sure i wish you could stay in la a while longer
you know i was thinking there are some great research facilities in india
where are you going with this leonard
well i’m just saying i don’t have any real ties here so if i were to move to new delhi we could you know go out
leonard didn’t we have this conversation five years ago
well yes but things have changed you know you’re older i’m older look no more superhero bedsheets
sweetheart just because we have fun when i come to town doesn’t mean i want to have a serious relationship
mmmm and besides i could never bring a white boy home to my parents they’d have a cow which is a much bigger deal in india
i’m not that white my greatgreat grandmother was half cherokee i know that’s not the right kind of indian but it is something
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
oh uh yeah i was trying to see if i could laugh as a woman
oh well good job quite convincing i smell perfume
and is that lipstick on your cheek and neck
uh rash that’s a bad rash
my sympathies i am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis can i interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection
uh yeah yeah that sounds great
very well i’m sure i can find something that will help you ditch that itch
okay he’s in the bathroom let’s go
do you prefer ointment or cream
with or without a numbing agent
really leonard there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis
well i think i have a nice 2009 anamantle hc it’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts
right right alright they creep almost to the apartment door
for shame leonard for shame and to think i was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you
is that really what you want to talk about leonard
what do you want to talk about
please don’t tell anyone i spent the night with raj’s sister
there it is what if someone asks
noone’s going to ask if i spent the night with raj’s sister
perhaps but they might ask me something else
like has leonard betrayed any of his friends recently
priya and i are both adults we didn’t betray raj
in fact you did but i was referring to howard
april 12th 2005 bob’s big boy toluca lake raj had just introduced us to priya for the first time and she was enjoying the sweet taste of hindu rebellion in the form of a bob’s super big boy hamburger in order to preserve your friendship you and howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her i had a patty melt
violation of the roommate agreement overnight guest notification clause
okay fine i’m i’m a horrible human being i’m the darth vader of pasadena
you’re far too short to be darth vader at best you might be a turncoat ewok
my point is priya’s gone and it would be much better if noone else found out about this
you mean you want me to keep a secret
you know i can’t keep a secret
you can if you try think about it this way if i were batman and you were alfred you’d keep that secret right
why do you get to be batman
because well batman has the secret
alfred knows that barbara gordon is batgirl which i’ve now just told to batman see i can’t keep a secret
i know that’s why i shortened it
i came to go over your alibi for last night
you’ve asked me to lie on your behalf and as you know i am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest so i’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi you couldn’t have spent last night with priya because you were with another woman
oh i’m so sure i’m going to regret this but who was i with
the fun loving and morally loose miss maggie mcgeary
you met her at pasadena’s most popular irish watering hole lucky baldwin’s where maggie spends her nights tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams
leonard call me if you’re interested in coitus sincerely maggie mcgeary
and if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this
it’s pretty convincing huh and it wasn’t even a real person and here is the clincher a lock of maggie’s flaming auburn hair
from an orangutan in the primate lab
well noone’s going to run a dna test on it leonard honestly you overthink everything
sheldon i don’t need an alibi nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip sheldon makes lip zipping movement thankyou now don’t worry everything is going to be fine sheldon writes “i doubt it” on leonard’s whiteboard
hey leonard will you please tell howard my sister’s never been attracted to him
c’mon raj how am i supposed to know who she’s attracted to or was attracted to or who she might be attracted to in the future
and i have nothing to contribute to this conversation because i too know absolutely nothing about priya’s preferences in male companionship and with that i will rezip my lip
hey so what did you guys think of the new episode of caprica last night
didn’t see it what were you doing
yeah i uh went for a drink
really you and where where did you go
oh i’ve heard of that place isn’t that pasadena’s favourite irish watering hole
did you meet anyone interesting there perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid
as a matter of fact i i… i can’t… i can’t… i can’t do it
sure you can you’re doing fine it’s very believable
look i’m sorry raj but the truth is i was with priya last night
don’t listen to him he’s still light headed from all the irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system
what were you doing with priya
i believe they engaged in coitus but more importantly if leonard had not abandoned his story would you have found it plausible
what you slept with my sister
how could you we had a pact
excuse me i think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear
may i point out in a parallel universe your friends are saying maggie mcgeary she sounds lovely
look i admit it i may have crossed a line here but come on raj your sister is a grown woman to her i’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate
i… i don’t believe it this is a terrible betrayal of my trust
no no no would it help if i told you that i offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it
yeah well raj i just want to say that i’d never betray your trust unlike leonard i respect you
was it out of respect that you didn’t tell raj about the time you dropped his iphone in a urinal
dude i put that thing on my face
i think a more amusing violation of raj’s trust is when howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to americans on thanksgiving
hey i didn’t see you giving back your snoopy snowcone maker
that was all a lie this year’s gifts are already wrapped
and as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends how about the month sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into leonard’s food
well excuse me that was not a betrayal that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy
you put moths in my food
i can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth
well uh i can’t believe you used sheldon’s toothbrush
not the brush part just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums
okay i i i think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of but come on we’re friends friends overlook each other’s minor lapses for the record howard i’m sorry that i broke our pact
thankyou and i’m sorry about your phone and thanksgiving and while we’re at it you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of july
as long as we’re apologising sheldon i i’m sorry i used your toothbrush
and i’m sorry but that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated we are no longer friends
i got you a talking thomas the tank engine for thanksgiving
hey you got snoopy out can i have a snowcone
these are pretty god what flavour is this
mango caterpillar what are you doing you said you liked it
no seriously i think i’ve finally figured out my problem with women
the capybara is the largest member of the rodent family
what does that have to do with me and women
nothing it was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation
my problem is i don’t project confidence so i decided that the next time i meet a woman i think is attractive rather than holding back and being cautious i’m going to assume the mantle of selfassurance
oh yeah what’s that look like
hi i’m leonard and you are beautiful you pop sparkle and buzz electric i’m going to pick you up at eight show you a night you will never forget
good news i made it onto the team for the new defence department laserequipped surveillance satellite
excuse me if we’re changing topics i believe i have first dibs with capybara a rodent the size of a baby hippo
thanks listen i have to get a security clearance so you guys might be hearing from the fbi
whoa whoa whoa i don’t want to speak to the fbi
i’m brown and i talk funny
they’re just doing a background check on me
it doesn’t matter they’ll find a reason to give me a oneway ticket back to gandhiville by the way when i say that it’s not offensive
don’t be ridiculous raj you’re here legally
nobody cares do you know how long it’s been since i got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy
you know i try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn
fine sheldon tell us about your giant rodents
no you squandered your time with me and the moment has now passed feast on your disappointment much as the capybara feasts on its own waste
oh bella don’t you see edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you knock on door coming
no thanks now about mr wolowitz
i’m in this country legally you know
i’m sure you are now to your knowledge has mr wolowitz ever committed a crime
of course not i’m here on an h1b visa which means i can’t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity and i’m not
good to your knowledge does mr wolowitz have any foreign contacts
no just me oh there it is here comes a cavity search
please don’t send me back to india it’s so crowded it’s like the whole country is one endless comiccon except everybody’s wearing the same costume indian guy
i love this country thethe baseball the freedom the rampant morbid obesity from california to the new york island i’m a real yankee doodle boy
my country ’tis of thee duh duh duh liberty it’s really great
so when howard said the fbi would be contacting me i was expecting mulder glad to see i got scully
mulder and scully xfiles the truth is out there never mind uh so what would you like to know
you work with mr wolowitz here at the university correct
yes of course we’re in different departments he’s an engineer and i’m an experimental physicist you know one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says hello maker of the universe i see what you did there good one
right now how would you characterize your relationship with mr wolowitz
good it’s a good relationship of course most of my relationships are good probably because i exude confidence people are drawn to that you know confidence not exuding
do you know of any groups mr wolowitz is a member of
you are beautiful you know that you pop sparkle and buzz electric i’m going to pick you up at eight show you a night you will never forget
yeah can my sixfoottwo navy seal husband come with us
is that oh my i didn’t see the ring with my glasses off so look at that i’m starting to exude
i suppose i could if i were asked
of course why do you have to make things so complicated
you say you’re special agent page fbi
and here is my justice league membership card but that doesn’t prove i know batman
i just want to ask you a few questions about howard wolowitz
oh all right i doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved oedipal complex
for the record i truly support the fbi in the mission which is expressed through their motto
correct now to business 18 years ago i sent the fbi crime lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and dna analysis why haven’t i heard back yet
well the fbi crime lab does have a lot on its plate
that’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes
would you mind if we talked about mr wolowitz now
thank you would you characterize him as responsible
i’m going to answer that with a visual aid this is my ninedisc complete lord of the rings trilogy bluray set  mr wolowitz borrowed it damaged plastic retention hub number three and then returned it to me hoping i wouldn’t notice would you characterize that as responsible
that’s really not the sort of thing we’re interested in
you heard me say bluray right
very well would you be interested in knowing that mr wolowitz once snuck onto my world of warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level80 warlock from sheldor to smeldor
i’m afraid not is there anything else
is there anything else where would you like to start he refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books i lend him he crashed the mars rover while attempting to impress a woman he recommended that i go see the third matrix movie because it was and i quote just as good as the first one if that’s not irresponsible i don’t know what is
that was actually a poorly chosen example as it had nothing to do with me
yes well let’s talk about it anyway
i don’t want to not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of howard wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars
thank you dr cooper i think i have all i need
oh good i was afraid you were going to fixate on that mars rover incident
hey buddies guess who didn’t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser
apparently the background interviews didn’t go well you guys wouldn’t know anything about that would you
well actually i may have gotten a little tipsy when i talked to her
and i may have hit on her a little bit
i may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes
i see well it’s good to know when i need you guys i can always count on you to step up and ruin everything
to tell you the truth i thought if anyone was going to screw things up for howard it’d be sheldon
well your expectations have been subverted aha
really maybe sleep has met you before
mockery that’s all you have to offer
i’m sorry why can’t you sleep
who knows i haven’t watched any scary movies recently i’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe and it’s been weeks since i took that accidental sip of red bull
did something happen today that’s bothering you
well i did mention the mars rover incident to that fbi agent and probably cost howard his security clearance
but why should that keep me up
interesting so you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience
actually you don’t have insomnia you’re sleeping now
do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis
how about that gorn sitting on the couch
that seems fairly conclusive in his bed no gorn no that’s where i sit
thank you for agreeing to see me agent page
thank you for filing a complaint with my superior dr cooper i understand you want to recant your statement about howard wolowitz
then i’m afraid you can’t withdraw it
i’m sorry i don’t recall you saying no backsies
yes i’d like to offer a laudatory statement about howard’s many excellent qualities that i believe will tip the scales back in his favour howard joel wolowitz h is for honesty of which he has much o’s for outstanding which he is such w’s for witty he’s quick with a joke a’s for artistic his ability…
i’m sorry dr cooper this matter is already closed
but i still have rd joel wolowitz left to go
i don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend howard when there are much more serious security threats to pursue for instance when i first met leonard he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a north korean spy and not one agent ever investigated that
no it’s a different leonard he’s chinese red hair six fingers goodbye
i think he’s eating lunch uh sheldon i want you to meet neil degrasse tyson from the hayden planetarium in new york
i’m quite familiar with dr tyson he’s responsible for the demotion of pluto from planetary status i liked pluto ergo i do not like you
but i actually didn’t demote pluto that was a vote of the international astronomical union
if ifs and buts were candy and nuts we’d all have a merry christmas think about that dr tyson
is that the guy you were telling me about
howard the person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me
yes but before you get upset i want you to know i went to the fbi and retracted my statement
and they were okay with that
no if anything i made it worse in any case i have been riddled with guilt which is causing gorninfested rem sleep so i’m here now to say i’m sorry
are you kidding me you’ve set my career back at least two years and you think you can make it right with i’m sorry
yes i followed the social protocol i attempted to right the wrong and when i failed to do so i delivered a heartfelt apology now you say apology accepted and i will offer you a onetimeonly high five
you’re tricking me it really is isn’t it
dr cooper i just wanted you to know i’m sorry for the role i played in the pluto matter
i have troubles penny i’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep
you know they have a really nice bar over at the olive garden
i don’t like the olive garden they treat me like family
okay sheldon what can i get you
could you be a little more specific
i’m sorry honey i don’t know millilitres
ah blame president james “jimmy” carter he started america on a path to the metric system but then just gave up he wonders why he was a oneterm president
would you say that’s about 40 milliliters
great drinks the tequila now where were we
i believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail fortunately thanks to computersavvy alcoholics there’s an app for that let’s see harvey wallbanger eh sex on the beach i hardly think so rob roy silk slipper mad hatter ooh i’ll have a rosewater ricky
you’ll need pitted brandied cherries gin rosewater angostura bitters and overproofed rum now first dust the cherries with sugar then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters then ignite the rum caramel…
here you go one rosewater ricky
that’s not how it looks in the picture
oh yeah you know every bartender makes it differently why don’t you give it a try
all right to the metric system knocks back drink spits it all back into glass i can’t taste the cherries
all right sheldon what’s on your mind
i wronged howard and he won’t accept my apology
oh right that yes leonard told me sorry honey
penny you face failure on a daily basis how do you cope
to drinking knocks back drink and spits it out again nope oh if only there were some way to force howard to accept my apology so i could escape this miasma of guilt
you know sometimes stuff just happens and there’s nothing you can do about it for example lisa peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade because no matter how much you apologize you can’t go back and undryhump someone’s boyfriend
i see you’re saying i’m facing starfleet academy’s unwinnable command scenario the kobayashi maru
impressive that you know that it’s hard to believe i’m actually having this conversation with you
kirk beat the kobayashi maru by reprogramming the simulator that’s it
what sheldon you can’t reprogram people
no you can’t reprogram people to james tiberius kirk drinks leaves comes back and spits it out again
howard you’re feeling better about me today aren’t you
yes you are i’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns
there’s a nine ninety five ebook down the drain
oh sheldon you can’t fix this with gifts
nevertheless i’ve hurt you and whether you forgive me or not i want you to have this
you’re giving me a couch cushion
no the cushion is merely symbolic i’m giving you my spot on the couch
no i love my mother my feelings for my spot are much greater it is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe and now it’s yours
oh my god dude now you have to forgive him
high five not too hard thank you
i haven’t cried like this since toy story 3
i got to tell you sheldon i understand why you chose this spot i mean the temperature is good but there’s no draft i can see the television but i can still talk to…
i changed my mind get out of my spot
okay help me out here how does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip
maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore that’s how i learned
i can’t believe you’ve never seen raiders of the lost ark
and i can’t believe you’ve never read eat pray love
when she comes out with eat pray run away from a giant boulder i’ll read it
i don’t care if eat pray love changed your life i’m not reading it
you know i could totally rock a hat like that
that’s the work of noted hollywood costume designer deborah nadoolman she also designed the iconic red and black jacket in michael jackson’s thriller video which i’ve never viewed in its entirety as i find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible and also it’s really scary
would someone please turn off the sheldon commentary track
there’s no switch just listen and learn
penny if you think this is good you should come with us friday to see it on the big screen at the colonial
well i’m watching it now why would i want to see it again on friday
because the print they’re showing on friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage
what 21 seconds that’ll be like seeing a whole new movie
exactly they say it finally solves the submarine controversy
did leonard i’m no expert but i believe what we just heard from penny was sarcasm she indicates it was oh good i’m eight for 26 this month
yeah i think i’ll pass but you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds
bet if i could make you understand why this is such a cool thing we’d still be together
uhhuh i’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that too
may i point out to you all that the screening is first come first served
relax it’s five o’clock the movie doesn’t start till midnight
another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight and it’s already five o’clock let’s go
you know if we miss it we’ll have the fun of listening to sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives
actually i’m not i’m using sarcasm to mock you
drat now i’m 8 for 27
don’t worry sheldon we’ll be fine
what happened to the leonard hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of star trek
oh well he waited in line for 14 hours while you napped in a lawn chair he got in a fight with a klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him and worst of all he saw star trek
i rest my case amy don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line
actually as the newest member of your social group i believe i’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time
leonard you’re right we should enjoy our meal arrive late and risk winding up with terrible seats assuming we get in at all
guys that’s really starting to get old
i have a girlfriend and you don’t
wait now we don’t know that yet he isn’t finished i have a girlfriend and you don’t who
so are you sure you don’t want to come with us to raiders
oh no that movie has melting faces it reminds me too much of the time i dropped that vial of flesheating bacteria into the rhesus monkey lab besides penny and i are having a girls’ night tonight
girls’ night what does that entail
oh you know girls get together hang out share girl talk
oh well maybe you can join us i’ll ask penny
no need penny and i are very close
yes in fact our menses are synchronized penny bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night
oh um it was it was just going to be me and bernadette besides i thought you were going to the movies with sheldon and the guys
yes but they’re not girls i’m a girl
yeah no no iii got that
all right i’ll have to go shopping
hugh people need to listen to me it’s time to get in line for the movie and that’s how you tell a knockknock joke
under normal circumstances i’d say i told you so but as i have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already the phrase has lost all meaning therefore i will be replacing it with the phrase i informed you thusly
ooh can’t wait for that to start
this is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner this is where we could have been if koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert
well i earned it dude i ate all my broccoli
and here’s where we are the runts in a large litter unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of indiana jones
so i guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner
you know guys when facing disappointment eat pray love teaches us–
so anyway to make a long story short turns out i have an unusually firm cervix
you know amy when we say girl talk it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts
shame ‘cause i have a real zinger about my titled uterus
oh thanks i found this place in alhambra it’s in a woman’s basement i think it’s a front
a colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk
so where should we go tonight a bar a club a movie
or we could just stay here
yes and continue to bond i have a feeling that after tonight one of you will become my best friend forever or bff if you prefer which i don’t
all right time to open bachelor number two
gee i don’t know if i should drink more i have to drive home and i’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is
that’s okay y ou can just sleep here
oh good a slumber party we’ll do makeovers initiate phony phone calls and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties
oh gosh amy i don’t know if i would call this an actual slumber party
well that’s disappointing i’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party
not even when you were a kid
well there was the time i had my tonsils out and i shared a room with a little vietnamese girl she didn’t make it through the night but up till then it was kind of fun
okay well i guess we’re having a slumber party oh
oh i hope they let us in soon i’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom the guy makes me buy a gatorade every time it’s a vicious circle
too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me
let me put it this way takes care of the bathroom problem and it keeps your calf warm
hey guys bad news i just did a quick calculation given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line we might not get seats
nice going raj just got him down for his nap
it’s fine it’s fine go back to sleep
oh i informed you thusly i so informed you thusly
howard you talk to him howard you’re peeing aren’t you
hey look who’s here hey buddies
well if it isn’t wil wheaton the jar jar binks of the star trek universe
well yousa can go think that at the back of the line no cuts no buts no coconuts
do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie we got here a little late
no problem come on i’ll hook you up
oh awesome wesa gonna go into the movie now byebye
this is indiana jones not star trek there should be no value to his pseudocelebrity here and even at star trek conventions they only let him in if he helps set up
i will not calm down this affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered as captain jeanluc picard once said the line must be drawn here this far no farther
had to wake him up from his nap didn’t you
you know what i really love about howard his chest hair
no just the one but it’s really long
okay there you go sultry sunrise red what do you think
my nails have never looked so pretty before get it off
oh oh uh looks like they’re getting ready to let people in
listen to what mr wil wheaton is tweeting best seats in house for raiders screening suck on that sheldon cooper
why do you read his twitter feed you know it’s only going to upset you
i believe in knowing my enemy leonard had twitter existed at the time would not general custer have followed the tweets of sitting bull would not lee have followed grant would not spy have followed spy i have more examples but excuse me on phone hello well this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality but go on test phrases all right imatote ulbu twad all together i’m a total buttwad why are you laughing hello
and that girls is how you make a phony phone call
i’m not sure i grasp the full entertainment value but all right next on wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities truth or dare
okay it’s your game you go first
hang on i’m familiarizing myself with the rules seems fairly straightforward bernadette truth or dare
all right to what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy
remember you have to answer honestly
wait no amy you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing
oh all right what is the circumference of your areolas
munching on complimentary popcorn woot woot oh the gall i hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea choking to death woot woot
guys i am sorry we are full up
we really want to see this is there anything you can do
sorry fire regulations should’ve gotten here earlier
this is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t
‘cause i’m the petty functionary with the clipboard bitch
i guess that’s that let’s go home
you know what i’m going back to i told you so i told you so
we can still see something uh the new sandra bullock movie is playing two blocks away you know sandy b always brings it
look a side door come on short round
i guess we’d better go after him
indy’s young sidekick from temple of doom
yeah i know who it is but why is it me
you’re right it should be a cuddly asian boy like me
and absolon hath kist hir nether yea and nicholas is scalded in the towte this tale is doon and god save al the rowte”
bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story the miller’s tale by chaucer is the dirtiest story i know it would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks
i thought it was pretty spicy especially the part where he kisses her nether yea
you might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant hint if one cares about hygiene one ought not be kissing it
okay my turn penny truth or dare
why are you still hanging out with leonard so much even though you broke up with him
oh that’s an excellent question for two people who claim to be no longer pairbonded you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company
i don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change
okay look just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends i mean leonard’s a great guy
then why did you terminate your relationship with him
i don’t know he got really serious and i wasn’t ready for it
interesting how will you react if in the future you become ready for it and leonard is unavailable because another woman has realized that he is to use your words a great guy
you can only ask one question
you know what i don’t want to play anymore
well i’m not sure how this is scored but i believe we may have won
where did he go raj whistles we’re looking for sheldon not marmaduke
raiders of the lost ark with 21 additional seconds if i can’t see it no one else can see it
no crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended
listen to me you are overtired you’re not thinking right put the movie back before we get into trouble
trouble is my middle name leonard actually it’s lee but i prefer trouble
oh look who they let in
don’t worry wil wheaton i was just leaving  dadadada dadada
come on guys hurry up hurry up
let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg
he’s got the movie get him
why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one
she’s been in there a long time
clearly losing truth or dare upset her perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity
well the internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism
where exactly on the internet have you been looking
oh hey amy look i’m sorry i got so upset i justwhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoawhoa what are you doing
don’t worry i’ll avoid the nether yea
i might have gone with eating raw cookie dough
you know who’s got to be the bravest person in the marvel universe whoever has to give shehulk a bikini wax
you want to talk brave how about captain america’s undocumented mexican gardener
he’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after the thing
as usual you’re all wrong the bravest person in the marvel universe is the doctor who gives wolverine his prostate exam
how about the guy who gets a prostate exam from wolverine
now you just being silly wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer answering phone hello yes the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs of course you can pizza dates back to the 16th century while the first elevator was not installed until 1852 that means that for over 300 years people carried pizzas up stairs be part of that proud tradition
i’ll go get penny while that guy spits on our food
do you think they gave wolverine an adamantium prostate
we’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes there are no stupid questions
damn it’s good to finally meet you son
okay i think a bit of context here might help
oh hey leonard i see you met my dad
come on in buddy take a load off
oh gee dad leonard can’t stay he just dropped by to say hello thanks for stopping by sweetie i’ll see you later kisses him passionately bye
are you sure you have enough comics you’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours and by my estimate you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material that’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing american comic book idioms like bamf and snikt
is that racist it feels racist
don’t be oversensitive he’s calling you illiterate not your race
oh okay good i don’t need more comics howard’s gonna stop by we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and indian monopoly
i don’t care for novelty editions of monopoly i prefer the classics regular and klingon
actually indian monopoly’s just like regular except the money’s in rupees instead of hotels you build call centers and when you pick a chance card you might die of dysentery just fyi that was racist
you’ll never guess what just happened
you went out in the hallway stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5000 years into the future where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins
well who would ever guess that
what… what kind of a kiss
a big kiss on the mouth
is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip that happens with me and my mom all the time
she introduced me to her father kissed me and then shut the door in my face
maybe she was trying to send you a message
yeah this man is not my father i’m being held hostage so i’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911
penny kissing me is not insane she used to kiss me all the time
einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results by that standard penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs
i’m just saying it felt like it may have meant something
ah this takes me back leonard obsessing about penny i mean don’t get me wrong i love your new stuff but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits
ooh ooh do our babies will be smart and beautiful that one always makes me laugh
why do i bother talking to you people
if it’ll make you feel better we rarely listen
hey can i talk to you out here for a sec
i’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza
so you’re probably wondering what that was all about
what uh the kissing and everything nah women do that to me all the time
yeah okay the thing is i kind of told my father we got back together again
well you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of you know you’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or or a baby
what kind of guys did you used to go out with
just guys anyway when i told him we split up he was heartbroken and he kept bugging me how’s leonard why can’t you get back together with leonard i bet leonard never tipped a cow over on himself so to get him off my back i told him we worked things out
really how how’d we manage that
well did you apologize did you have to woo me
get over yourself i whistled you came running
yeah no i don’t think so
okay why are you arguing about this
i’m just saying if we fake got back together that’s totally not how it fake happened
oh okay whatever will you please just play along until my dad leaves
hold on you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing cause i’m good with that
come on honey not in front of my dad
relax i’ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider
so leonard i’m taking your gal out for a steak dinner you want to join us
oh dad that’s nice but leonard has to work right leonard
uh i do i have to work but i’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father ’cause you know just the kind of boyfriend i am
how could that be a miss c6 was a hit c8 was a hit part of your starship has to be on c7
not if it has a hole in the middle
what kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle
oh great you made it come on in i invited her
it’s in hawaii but raj controls it from here he’s hoping to see epsilon eridani dim which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it
so we just sit and stare at the screen waiting for something to happen
i did it with you when we rented the notebook raj whispers yes gena rowlands is a treasure you’d better open up that bottle of wine or i’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear
excuse me i can’t be drinking i’m about to make an important scientific discovery here
what galileo did his best work while drinking wine
well he was italian it’s a reasonable assumption
dude can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype
oh i i’m sorry galileo drank diet sprite look you’re my best friend she’s my girlfriend you should bond you know like you and my mom did
your mom creeps the hell out of me
yes but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire
well i’d like to propose a toast to science and friendship
hold on wait no it’s okay go ahead
oh i was working with penicillinresistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and i was just trying to remember if i washed my hands
let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with this this fella donnie
oh will you please let it go
donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government
a lot of people are doing that
yeah but all donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom’s camry
yeah that’s great it’s a funny story moving on
and donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the olympics what was his name sweetheart
curtis and i’m pretty sure he was joking
i don’t know that petition looked real to me
yeah okay i think this ends the exboyfriend portion of our evening
well i’m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper
leonard you want to come in for a nightcap
oh gee dad he’d love to but leonard has to work in the morning
maybe i could go in a little late
no no no you can’t your career is far too important
behind every great man is a nagging woman who won’t let him have any fun am i right leonard
good night wyatt oh good night honey
three four five pass go get 2000 rupees six seven whoops can’t go any further there’s a sacred cow in my way
bernadette please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes
it won’t help once he finds a joke he likes he sticks with it
oh right did you get your hair cut
no i got them all cut
and when you go to a chinese restaurant he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie
right help i’m a prisoner in a chinese fortune cookie factory
okay i think that’s enough about me
he’s right let’s make fun of his mother howard come rub my feet my corns are killing me
howard help me out of the tub i’m stuck again
shut up you know what i’ve been doing for the last hour
mm dreamily doodling mrs leonard hofstadter in a notebook
listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are
you got to admit i am i’m delightful
why are you making this so difficult
it’s not difficult for me i’m having fun
what do you want me to do you started this do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up
well then what do you want
don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here
leonard penny excellent i’d like to say i’m very happy that you’re back together and if i can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere i will in the meantime i’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address penny’s annoying personal habits
oh my god what personal habits
i have a list fyi overuse of the phrase oh my god is number 12
okay sheldon you don’t have to do this because leonard and i are not…
babababa are you sure you want to include him in this
include me in what is there a plot afoot i’ll have no truck with plots
no you’re right no there’s there’s no plots no trucks no feet so what other annoying habits shall we discuss
uh we don’t discuss anything leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement as such he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines
yes if penny’s going to be spending nights here again you’ll need to set up an escrow account sign here
hello hawaii this is dr koothrappali in pasadena i’d like you to reposition the telescope please scarlett johansson’s house i’m kidding hawaii mahalo whoo
it might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine
well live and learn so raj do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life
maybe if it did i’d be famous i’d be on the cover of magazines and then instead of living alone in my tiny apartment i’d have a big mansion
it is if you like wandering around a big empty house with no one to love you
no you wouldn’t you’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame my only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler and the little people i hired to be my living chess set
he’s taking a turn to the dark side isn’t he
hold on he could come back
oh what’s the point of everything
you know it’s been more than a year since i’ve even kissed a girl
what about that hookup at comiccon you told me about
oh grow up i was lying i lie all the time nobody wants to kiss me
oh you poor poor thing raj you have to know you’re a wonderful man there are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you
oh i think i got a nibble
oh bbe careful give him some line okay now reel him in
oh look at that baby they’re really biting huh
yeah they do that when you set it on easy
oh that’s me hello oh hi sweetie yeah i got up early and didn’t want to wake you so i went out for coffee and ran into leonard on the way back guess what we’re fishing yeah right here on his couch
hey baby i love you mwuh mwuh mwuh mwuh mwuh
that’s leonard says he loves you what i see the whole thing’s bull squirt huh well that’s very disappointing bye
oh hey there’s been something i’ve been meaning to tell you
i can’t believe you would lie to me like that
just for the record i did not want to be a part of this
i’ll get to you in a minute
that my own daughter thinks i don’t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes well that hurts me deeply
i thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri and the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes
you’re a grown woman and i respect your right to make your own decisions but all i ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them
you’re right look from now on i will tell you the truth
thank you now why don’t you go and put some clothes on and we’ll grab a bite to eat before i head for the airport now you
daddy he had nothing to do…
please please please don’t give up on her
i can’t go back to the skateboard idiots the white rappers and all those sweaty dumbasses with their backwards hats
gee i don’t know if it’s in the cards sir
then stack the deck cheat lie i don’t care i want grandkids before i die and i want them to grow up in a house without wheels
thank you now i’m going to do something here to help you along
just don’t panic now get your sorry lying ass out of my face and make sure i never see it again
oh the reverse psychology thing i see that’s very clever
oh there you are just so you know i was up all night but i have finally completed the pennyspecific section of the new roommate agreement
yeah well not necessary we broke up again
do you even think about other people leonard do you
oh how’d it go last night
oh you know same old same old looked through a telescope saw some stars big whoop
really you waited months for time with that telescope what happened
i’m going to propose a hypothesis last night raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the united states government to keep it a secret
nothing happened can we please just change the subject
that sounds rehearsed we are not alone
you get to play with raj’s big telescope last night
whoa where did that come from
i did shut up now you shut up
thank you how come you didn’t call me this morning
clarify something for me isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions an opportunity to consider important issues of the day
it is you just kind of put a damper on things when you said the next person i see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death
well we could argue about who said what all night long but to set things back on course i will propose a new topic of conversation
what is the best number by the way there’s only one correct answer
five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight
wrong the best number is 73 you’re probably wondering why
73 is the 21st prime number its mirror 37 is the 12th and its mirror 21 is the product of multiplying hang on to your hats seven and three eh eh did i lie
we get it 73 is the chuck norris of numbers
chuck norris wishes in binary 73 is a palindrome onezerozeroonezerozeroone which backwards is onezerozeroonezerozeroone exactly the same all chuck norris backwards gets you is sirron kcuhc
just for the record when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator upsidedown it spells boobies
remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight
i love your little heart locket bernadette
oh thanks howard gave it to me it’s the cutest thing every time i have dinner with his mom the next day i get jewellery
did you know that the iconic valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over
oh so i spent seventh grade dotting my i’s with little asses cool
hey zack what are you doing here
my dad’s company prints the menus for this place i’m just dropping off some new ones laminated makes ’em easier to clean if people throw up on ’em guess how i got the idea
yeah i got it i got it uh zack these are my friends bernadette and amy
okay well it was good to see you
he’s really cute how do you know him
oh we went out a couple of times
i’m often flummoxed by current slang does went out mean had intercourse
no no but in this case yes
interesting and was it not satisfactory
no it was great he just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level
couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to npr
wouldn’t help zack can’t even spell npr
it’s what i do with howard i’m much smarter than he is but it’s important to protect his manhood
i’m suddenly feeling flushed my heart rate is elevated my palms are clammy my mouth is dry in addition i keep involuntarily saying hoo
oh we know what’s causing that don’t we
it’s no mystery i obviously have the flu coupled with suddenonset tourette’s syndrome
did you hear about the accident at the bio lab
they were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit
no he got five stitches and a tetanus shot
well you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab you kind of want to turn into a superhero
yeah but who’d want to become ratman
who wouldn’t you could zip through a maze in nothing flat squeeze through really small holes and shut down restaurants in a single bound and the best part is if i were ratman you could be my sidekick mouse boy
you don’t like mouse boy how about uh uh kid vermin
first of all if we had superpowers i wouldn’t be the sidekick you’d be the sidekick
leonard settle this of the two of us who’s the obvious sidekick
12 years after high school and i’m still at the nerd table
aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin
it’s too thin if i were making a footlong brain sandwich at quiznos for examination under a twophoton microscope it’s fine
well you’re the expert if the correct way to do it is the wrong way then i yield
very well if you die and donate your body to science i promise to slice your brain like canadian bacon
now if you’ll excuse me i have to take my temperature
are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity i did that one summer ah youth
no i experienced some distressing symptoms last night so i’m checking my vital signs every hour
i’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis
all right what were the symptoms
elevated heart rate moist palms dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing
interesting not body parts that usually team up what about environmental factors describe the scene for me
i was sitting in a restaurant with penny and bernadette drinking water carbonated as it was a special occasion penny’s friend zack stopped by and said hello and i said hoo
all right let’s start over what did you say when zack walked in
why do you keep saying zack
i’m not saying hoo now i said hoo last night
and the answer was zack correct
there was no question i simply said hoo
all right i think i have enough to go on possible explanations for your symptoms are in descending order of likelihood hyperthyroidism premature menopause hosting an alien parasite or and i only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases sexual arousal
where would i have picked up an alien parasite
let me ask you a question what are you most afraid of
i don’t know um nuclear war accidentally being buried alive any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die and then you do
no something very specific that we both know you rajesh koothrappali are terrified of
well type two diabetes runs in my family the thought of losing a toe…
a jar with a big spider in it of course bravery test first one to take his hand out is the sidekick
no but it’s a stupid test
oh really what if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider
oh yeah what if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked
oh come on that’s never gonna happen now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick
how did you get so brave all of a sudden
it’s easy the spider’s crawling up your arm
get it off get it off please raj ah ah ah please oh
my blood work shows thyroid function normal cortisol levels normal
how about your folliclestimulating hormone levels
sheldon i am not going through menopause
are you sure you said that with the testy bark of an old biddy
i think we need to face the cold hard truth i was sexually aroused by penny’s friend zack
hang on i don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake
let’s look at this logically i have a stomach i get hungry i have genitals i have the potential for sexual arousal
a cross we all must bear you know in difficult moments like this i often turn to a force greater than myself
star trek did you see star trek
don’t it’s terrible however in it we learn that when spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half he suppresses them using the vulcan mental discipline of kolinar
are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction
using kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment
is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy
i hadn’t considered that give me a moment all right i’ve considered it
you reject it because you don’t feel jealousy or because you are suppressing jealousy
i think i’ll eat my lunch at home
that’s not your lunch sheldon those are the cadaver brain specimens
oh as they were incorrectly sliced you can see how i could mistake them for my sashimi
hey isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night
the supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener if this one under or oversoftens i’ll need time to make things right
the alternative would be to think backwards and that’s just remembering
amy’s changed i might have to let her go
i thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect like me but recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges like you
just going to skip over that insult
yeah that’s why i’m going to skip over it are you saying that amy is oh what’s the
it’s simple biology there’s nothing i can do about it
i’m suggesting there might be something you could do about amy’s urges
it’s illegal to spay a human being
yeah that’s not what i had in mind
oh oh you mean something i could do
well i was hoping to avoid this but i might as well get it over with thank you penny i’ll let you know what happens
yes this is dr sheldon cooper is this the zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour penny sorry to bother you hello i’m looking for a zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour penny coitus it means intercourse and i have a feeling i’m speaking to the right zack this is sheldon cooper fine shelly yes that does sound like a girl’s name no it doesn’t bother me yes smelly shelly does bother me let me tell you why i’m calling i’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with amy farrah fowler amy farrah fowler yes that is a girl’s name good grief it’s like trying to talk to a dolphin
really this is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick
every idea is better than this idea
wait what the hell is ding
i don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell
fine how do you want to start
i say uh how about one two three go
okay how about uh on your mark get set go
that’s for a footrace if you want to race we have to go outside
no it’s chilly outside didn’t bring my jacket
oh for crying out loud what kind of superhero needs a jacket
what kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights dibs on the red tights
all right how about this ready wrestle
wait are we starting now or is that what you’re going to say when we do start or…
suppose there are worse ways to spend a friday night none come to mind
look at this stamp on what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter
little comfort tonight i look like a hell’s angel
are you sure this is what you want to do
it’s not what i want to do it’s what i have to do
go amy farrah fowler follow your endocrine system
thank you sheldon you’re a good friend
please don’t drag this out this is never going to come off
excuse me zack i am amy farrah fowler we met the other night i have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge until i met you my decisions were founded in logic and reason and yet here i stand before you 130 pounds of raging estrogen longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs
on the other hand as i look at the blank apelike expression on your face i have decided to adopt the vulcan practice of kolinar goodbye zack
bye hoo that should hold me for a while
i’m legally obligated to inform you that i took a karate lesson when i was 11 i’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool
oh yeah well i’ve been taking pilates class at the rec center and my abs look like sections of a hershey bar
oh yeah won’t matter you’re going down
if anybody’s going to go down it’s going to be you
fellas it’s been 30 minutes nobody’s touched each other
i’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect
as am i holds sheldon’s hand
an experiment nope nothing never mind
i prefer to think that i can’t lose
you’re wrong it’s only a matter of time before you fall into ratman’s rat trap
you pathetic fool if there were a ratcatcher wouldn’t it catch ratman
just because i didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid you bloviating buffoon
you crimson coward oh leonard wake up you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips
yes infinite sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because i made it at work
do you understand why people don’t want to play with you
no although it’s a question i’ve been pondering since preschool
hey your copy of science magazine was in my mailbox
check it out all about planets this month
agree to disagree that’s what i love about science there’s no one right answer
so you and zack again huh
yeah yeah me and zack again
okay we should we should go
ah not yet i want to talk science with the science dudes
oh and the science dudes want to talk science with you what do you want to talk about rocks dinosaurs our friend the beaver
you know i saw this great thing on the discovery channel turns out that if you kill a starfish it’ll just come back to life
was the starfish wearing boxer shorts because you might have been watching nickelodeon
no i’m almost sure that it was the discovery channel it was a great show they also said dolphins might be smarter than people
they might be smarter than some people
well maybe we can do an experiment to find out
oh that’s easy enough we’d need a large tank of water a hoop to jump through and a bucket of whatever bitesized treats you find tasty
oh i see you guys are inferring that i’m stupid
that’s not correct we were implying it you then inferred it
you know for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied you can be real jerks shame on all of you closes door
what the hell did i do
you think penny’s right were we bullying zack
no i know bullying he left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpantsfree
and nobody drew a penis on his forehead
first day of cricket camp they drew it so the testicles were my eyes
i don’t know i think we might owe the guy an apology
you started it we just piled on
zack i’m sorry you’re stupid have a milk dud
yeah milk duds with their selfdeprecating name and remarkably mild flavour are the most apologetic of the boxed candies
i got a better idea we’re all responsible i say we all go come on who’s with me free comic books to anyone who comes with me i might get punched you really want to miss that
yeah we came to talk to zack hey zack
listen uh the stuff we were saying before we were just kidding around
no you weren’t you were making fun of me
come on that’s what we do we give each other a hard time hey sheldon you look like a praying mantis
i don’t know it still wasn’t very nice
oh i love milk duds okay we’re cool
you guys want to come in and have a beer
uh we’re on our way to the comic book store
really i haven’t been to a comic book store in literally a million years
you want to go with ’em
wait wwwaitwaitwait you’re ditching me to go look at comic books
wow this place is awesome where do they keep the archies
in the bedrooms of tenyearold girls where they belong
oh no you’re thinking oldschool archie it’s much more sophisticated now like there’s two universes and archie’s married to betty in one and veronica in the other midge is even breaking up with moose
you guys finally chip in for a bodyguard
uh no oh this is zack he’s a friend of ours zack this is stuart he owns the store
yeah i work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour
uh no it’s an indictment of the american education system
so are you guys coming to my new year’s eve costume party
of course we’re coming as the justice league of america
switching it up from last year when we came as the justice league of america
to that point it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare best group costume if we shore up our weak link which is clearly leonard as superman
hey i got new boots this year guaranteed to add three inches
that’s sad let’s ask ourselves is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of krypton
than than leonard in highheeled boots howard’s mother in highheeled boots
i was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of betty and veronica
he is the only person we know with actual muscles
you can’t replace me with zack
yeah she seems happier why wouldn’t we be
score i got an archie betty and veronica and a jughead all set for my weekend number twos
congratulations zack how would you like to be superman
i don’t know sounds like a lot of responsibility
fine if zack’s going to be superman i want to be green lantern
i don’t want to be aquaman he sucks he sucks underwater he sucks fish pee
excuse me i believe aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere
well you won’t be when you hear the great news
we’re going to a costume party at the comic book store on new year’s eve and you get to be wonder woman
complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth invisible plane sold separately
wait why me whwhy can’t your girlfriend be wonder woman
she and her lab team are under quarantine seems at the christmas party they were doing jello shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever
okay what about your friend amy
amy farrah fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes she isn’t the free spirit i am
okay well forget it i’m not spending my new year’s eve at a comic book store wearing a wonder woman costume
he says he’ll wear it if you’ll be aquaman
we’re going to be late i’m pacing nervously
this is how the flash paces
i’m not sheldon i’m the flash and now i’m going to the grand canyon to scream in frustration i’m back
oh i hardly think so the real caped crusader calls his crimefighting cohorts when he’s running late
i had to walk i couldn’t get raj on the back of my scooter
i’ve said this before and i’ll say it again aquaman sucks
look up in the sky it’s a bird it’s a plane i forget the rest
all right let’s get this thing over with
i’m sorry but in what universe is wonder woman blonde
relax no one’s going to be looking at her hair ow i mean ow
hold on the costume came with a black wig where is it babe
no i’m not wearing it it looks stupid
come on we’re trying to win a contest here
forget it i’m not wearing the wig
penny there’s no i in justice league
okay babe uh kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends
okay you know what i changed my mind i’m not going
looks like someone else is going to have to be wonder woman
then who are you talking to babe
knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny knock penny
what the hell is wrong with you
i’m the flash i just knocked 30000 times
okay what do you want sheldon
yes you’re afraid that costume makes you look fat
don’t worry wonder woman was an amazon and amazons tend to be very beefy gals
but they’re not blonde so put on your wig hello
if it makes you feel any better when i was dating penny she used to flip out on me all the time
she told me she dated a guy named leonard who would have thought it was you
i don’t know somebody bigger and yeah sure why not you
okay i guess we just go without a wonder woman
i don’t want to go without penny
oh great no superman no wonder woman all we’ve got is a skinny flash an indian aquaman a nearsighted green lantern and a teeny tiny dark knight
obviously we’re no longer a justice league we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costumes
oh man scooter sucks he’s the aquaman of the muppet babies
no we can still make this work leonard you talk to penny
what makes you think i can convince her
you got her to have sex with you obviously your superpower is brainwashing
okay let me see if i understand this you want me to convince my exgirlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize
yes and make her wear the black wig good luck
i’m not going to that party leonard
okay listen you don’t have to wear the wig at this party we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl
did i do something i mean i tried to be friends with zack like you said which believe me was difficult given how you and me used to be you know you and me and now you and him are you and him
okay look we’re not really me and him
i don’t know i only started seeing zack again so i wouldn’t be alone on new year’s eve how pathetic is that
not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on new year’s eve
you make a cute green arrow
there’s a big difference arrow lantern
whatever look if zack and i had just gone to a regular club or a party it would have been fine but this with the costumes and you
nothing let’s go to the party puts on wig how do i look
um i guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there
okay the good news is we have a wonder woman
superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight
and the award for best group costume goes to justice league of america number three
thank you thank you so much
okay okay ten seconds to midnight
no wait i have a speech
this is my moment dag nab it
i’m not going to say another word until you people settle down i’m waiting
that was a great party we should dress like this all the time
check it out those guys are breaking into that car
we’re the justice league of america there’s only one thing we can do turn around and slowly walk away
look i know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees but i’m a little warm so i’m going to turn it down
good lord how you frustrate me leonard hofstadter runs back fine
ma ma calm down listen to me i know it says click with the mouse but on a laptop the trackpad is the mouse now put your finger on it doesn’t matter which finger good choice now move it down to your email icon yeah the little envelope what do you mean what does it look like it looks like an envelope fine you don’t like the computer don’t use it sure we can exchange it for a salad spinner goodbye
that’s a hanukkah present you’re regretting huh
i won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged but if we made an example of one or two it might give the others incentive to try harder
i had a great idea you know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations like when you’re doing fourier analysis or using the schrodinger equation
howard doesn’t he’s only an engineer
i was thinking we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine you just use your smartphone take a picture of the equation and bam
you know what’s a great app the one that makes fart noises
you know leonard that’s actually a valid idea very good
can you say that and not make it sound like i’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet
no the two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable though if pressed i’d have to give a slight edge to the cat i’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer i agree to be part of your project congratulations
oh yay for me what about you guys i can’t promise anything but people do make money off stuff like this
a few extra bucks would be nice i could finally move out of my mother’s house
i always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage
you know if i made more money i could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides
what’s that some weird sex thing
no you take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine and you show them fish why does everything have to be dirty with you
i was thinking we could work on this at night and then maybe in a couple of weeks we’ll have ourselves an app to sell
i think we should take a picture to capture this moment
was that the best 99 cents i ever spent or what
i checked the app store no one is doing handwritingrecognition differential equation solving
you have so few good ideas leonard and you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider
sheldon i don’t think penny cares about handwritingrecognition based differential…
the stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of texas
she’s not going to steal our idea
the prairie sky is wide and high deep in the heart…
whatever your secret is i’m sure it’s boring so i’m not interested
it’s not boring at all you see in higher order mathematics there are certain sets of equations that…
hardly consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario a young woman alone in the big city her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her
well hang on let’s see where he’s going
then it hits her how is she going to survive i mean she has no prospects no marketable skills and then one day she meets a group of geniuses and their friend howard
hang on let’s see where he’s going
she befriends them and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea which she steals and sells to the highest bidder
oh is it well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time
oh great you know what i’ve already mooched dinner off you guys i don’t need to listen to this
all right i’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our groundbreaking new app
hey why am i in charge of phone support seems a bit racist
a customer service representative with an indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres
oh very clever but still racist
why am i listed as your executive assistant
because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute fyi my mother’s birthday is coming up i’m going to need you to pick up a present
okay we need to stop for a minute
leonard please we can talk during our break we have one coming up at midnight we’ll need snacks
sheldon you’re not in charge it’s my idea i’m in charge
oh of course you are look at the organizational chart you’re clearly listed as founder
well yes and you’re listed as chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief operating officer
you missed chief science officer chairman of the board and head of the secret santa committee
okay you need to get clear on this right now i am in charge of this project
ooh leonard’s going all alpha nerd on sheldon’s ass
all right all right i’m not going to argue with you sheldon cooper is nothing if not a team player dr hofstadter you have the conn
thank you i thought we might start by talking about the user interface
so this button here will allow you to scan a new equation but over here you can press this and just substitute new values for the coefficients
this diagram i assume you were opening with a joke it certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps
it’s not a joke it’s the real design
in that case may i offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing
sheldon i think this will work let’s just try it my way
oh i’m i’m sorry i assumed that you wanted candid truthtelling from your employees but i realize now you want the mindless nattering of complacent yesmen
so right now this buttonpress event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…
how about this for the app name the surprisingly helpful equationlinked differential optimized numerator
we’re not doing names now howard
like i was saying right now it’s just a dummy procedure but eventually it will drop us into…
all right fine if we’re not going to give it a name can we at least give it a secret code designation
well but hear me out the atomic bomb was the manhattan project windows 95 was originally project chicago for our app i would humbly suggest project nodlehs
we’re not wasting time with names right now
i see is that decision open for discussion
is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion
again right now it’s just a dummy procedure but eventually it will drop us into…
i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…
all right let’s get right to the vote show of hands all those opposed to leonard and his reign of tyranny
because you’re impossible to work with
i see and is that open for discussion
oh good morning shoemaker i think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night
oh i know i’m now an independent contractor
no you are now nothing you have no connection to this project whatsoever
i don’t want it better i want it my way
well that speaks volumes doesn’t it all right i suppose i’ll go put on my bus pants
what the hell are bus pants
they are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on but perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man
look i’m still happy to drive you to work nothing’s changed in that regard we’re still roommates we’re still friends
except you identified me your best friend as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away the desperate act of a little man with a big napoleon complex
you know what go put on your bus pants
mm last night i had a dream we got so rich from the app you and i bought matching sidebyside mansions but there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard what do you think that means
it means after we play handball i’m showering at home
good morning friend howard friend raj i see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages perhaps they would taste better out of these
don’t thank me you earned it
howard wolowitz why not world’s greatest engineer
i’m sorry i typed that into the label maker but i just couldn’t press enter now down to business what would it take for you to abandon leonard and join me in a rival company unless of course the mugs are sufficient in which case welcome aboard
i understand and your loyalty is admirable but what if i were to up the ante
monogrammed key chains with a builtin laser pointer no how about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot go beavers i’ll be back
okay let’s try this one spherical hankel function
hey we agreed when it was eureka time we were all gonna say it together
greetings gentlemen how goes your little project
ah a combination of all your names very clever i assume koothranardowitz was taken
we’re actually scanning equations and getting good results
oh well then by all means carry on i wouldn’t want to impede your progress
howard did you solve the install time problem yet
no it’s a little tricky i’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
no i mean what are you doing with a theremin
playing it i’ve loved the theremin from the first moment i heard the original star trek theme and it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet gathering dust
that’s all right i can barely hear you over my theremin leonard pulls out plug well that was a little uncalled for
no that was completely called for we need quiet
so your project is more important than mine
well seeing as your project is to sabotage my project yes
don’t beat around the bush leonard if you don’t want me here just say the word and i’ll leave
could have beaten around the bush a little
nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen nobody knows my sorrowowowow
what you doing trying to contact your home planet
nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen glory hallelujah
something got you down there sheldon
leonard kicked me out of my own apartment and his app team
he wouldn’t drive me to work today i had to wear my bus pants
probably going to have to throw them away
hey you don’t need leonard and his app you can make one with me
seriously i have a great idea for one
is it better than your idea to move to los angeles and become a famous actress
okay look when you see someone wearing shoes you like you just snap a picture of them and the app goes on the internet to find out where you can buy them
i didn’t say that but no i don’t
oh penny where do i begin the simplemindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality
and leonard didn’t want to work with you imagine that
i know it’s baffling singing nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen
sheldon i’m gonna make some cocoa do you want some
do you make it with milk or water
that’s what it says on the packet
do you have those little marshmallows
a disappointing drink for a disappointing day
hey look at this 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta
i’m telling you the lenwoloppali differential equation scanner meets a real need we’ve got a hit
what do you think we should sell it for
well based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys and you want a submarine i’d say about a million dollars a pop
well what if we put out a lite version for half a million you know get the word of mouth going
hi i’m sorry to bother you guys but you’ve got to come take your sheldon back
what’s he doing in your apartment
well he was moping down in the lobby so i invited him over and now i regret it
why do you regret uh never mind stupid question
look can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime
we’re not playing this is real work
okay what if i got him to apologize and promise to behave
then i guess we would let him back on the app team and while we’re doing that you could take an aerial tour of la on your flying pig
i’ll tell you one thing if i get rich enough that’s the kind of girl i want to take on a submarine ride and yes that time i meant it to be dirty
oh yes he says they are lost without you
well we sure saw that coming
you know what i’m going to do i am going to sit here and just let them stew
no no no you know they have suffered enough everybody’s suffered enough the thing is you’re going to have to offer him a facesaving way out of this
oh no mrs mary cooper didn’t raise her no liars
okay um how about this you know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm
oh good for you so all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to leonard but say it sarcastically
of course he will hear it as an attempt to mend fences as opposed to the withering condemnation you and i will know it to be
yeah yeah that was my plan all right come on let’s go
oh by the way thank you for the delicious cocoa
boy i’m getting good at this
okay now that you’re back on the team let’s get you caught up
before you begin let me say again how deeply sorry i am for my earlier behaviour and how much i respect and admire your leadership
thank you so as you can see not only can you store your favourite equations but you can forward them to your friends or post them on facebook right from the app
well i must say i am impressed
you all have clearly put in a lot of hard work
as a result you have taken the most important step on the road to success learning what not to do now let’s start fresh howard we’re going to need some tea
okay these are uggs these are crocs these are knockoff manolo blahniks
look you said it yourself we have to create a database before you can write an algathingy
algorithm you see penny alan turing defined an algorithm…
bored okay these are steve maddens these are nine west these are target oh but don’t they look like chanel these are michael kors these are roxy these are sachel’s oh these are betsy johnson they’re so cute…
nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen nobody knows my sorrow…
hey so you guys ready to order
since we come in every tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing and it’s now six oh eight i believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out and uh how are they hanging
okay so the usual with extra spit on sheldon’s hamburger
penny a moment do you have plans this weekend
oh gee amy i’m sorry i’m actually pretty busy this weekend
probably serving food that was ordered today
that’s too bad i was hoping you could be my plusone at the institute of interdisciplinary studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions
it’s an annual science conference we’ve all been invited to speak
oh oh okay well you know like i said i have plans so
shame since you’re my best friend i thought it would be a good bonding opportunity
oh don’t feel bad i never read leonard’s and i used to sleep with him
do you know anybody else who would appreciate an allexpensepaid spa weekend at a fourstar resort in big sur
no i really i’m sorry free what sorry what what
i think her weekend just opened up
wait wait just to be clear when you guys say spa does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it
pretty much except we keep our shirts on in the sauna
you know it is going to be difficult but i’m going to cancel my plans so i can do this for my bestie
all right i just want to establish boundaries
boy this is great i haven’t had a vacation in ages
in order to take a vacation one first has to work
you know for a smart guy you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat
that does seem to be a valid principle
i trust penny will adhere to the official california restaurant workers’ solemn oath of ethics and cleanliness”
i don’t believe there’s any such thing
good morning if i could have everyone’s attention please i know we’re all eager to get on the road to big sur so if we focus i’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour then it’s just qa quiz safety drills pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off
don’t worry just sit next to me during the quiz and you can copy my answers
raj what are you doing i don’t think so you’ve had your allotted six ounces the first bathroom break isn’t until the denny’s located near bakersfield which is approximately two and half hours away remember people we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder
nobody cares about your kegel exercises
all right we have seven people and two cars in the lead car driven by leonard will be myself amy farrah fowler and penny
yes he had you in the other car but i got you upgraded
she made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere your nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild
red leader to red five come in red leader to red five come in howard you promised
fine  red five to red leader what do you want now
it’s eleven fifteen i’m requesting your quarterhourly location update
copy that red five radio contact is sufficient no need to extend your middle finger
so amy i’ve been wondering are you and sheldon going to be sharing a room
no we discussed it we decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well
indeed nothing sours a friendship more than overfamiliarity with someone’s toilet routine
don’t worry penny you’re my plusone you’ll bunk with me and fyi travel makes me constipated so i’m the ideal hotel roommate
i hope we get there in time to see the keynote address
really you want to see the keynote
yeah it sounds fun super bacteria
actually i was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap
we can watch it later on cspan besides i was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel
well honey if you’re that tired why don’t you just take a nap here in the car
hang on it’s leonard hi leonard
yeah hi listen i just got a text from raj he wanted me to tell you that when howard says nap he means sex
are you an element in the actinoid series
are you usually radioactive when found in nature
are you in the lanthanoid series
uh i don’t know are you food
that’s not apropos we’ve already established i’m found in the periodic table
well it’s a table right i mean why can’t there be food on it
i knew she wasn’t lead car material
who elected you road trip god
it was a latenight vote we were all exhausted and he was threatening to filibuster it’s not technically road trip god it’s travel supervisor
although road trip god does have a certain ring to it
i don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this someone should stand up to him what’s he going to do
i can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car
what could we do he’s the travel supervisor
don’t worry penny this is a better car anyway
they say we’re young and we don’t know we won’t find out until we grow
well i don’t know if all that’s true ’cause you got me and baby i got you
babe mm dada dada dada i got you babe dada dada dada i got you babe…
you know what i missed you too
are you here for the conference
yeah i’m doing a global warming panel
oh good for you uh glenn this is my boyfriend howard
you’re a lucky man bernie’s a great gal
well i got to run the panel’s tomorrow morning it’s called remembering snow
please tell me he’s your gay cousin
no he was one of my professors in college
then we went out for a year come on let’s check in so we can take that nap
no it’s not necessarily proportional shut up
that green bag is dr cooper’s here’s an extra five make him wait oh right to the nap huh okay uh so this glenn guy you say you went out with him for like a year
do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now
no i guess not what is he like sixfour sixfive
probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits
i’m just thinking if you had sex with that guy i mean there’s nothing i can do here that will make any kind of impact
howard it’s not a contest i love you i want to be with you
yeah great love you too but if it were a contest i wouldn’t have a chance right
sorry i just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that
wait a minute a girl like me what’s that mean
are you saying you don’t think i’m hot enough to go out with a guy like glenn
no no i’m saying exactly the opposite
i’m too hot to go out with a guy like glenn
still nothing remind me to try again in an hour
um sure what do you what do you got in mind
do you subscribe to the freudian theory of penis envy
um i never really thought about it why
sometimes i think it might be nice to have one
not for sex for convenience you can’t deny that by comparison our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance
again i’ve never given it much thought
we have time now think about it
howard’s a complete and total ass
oh yeah that come on in
thanks i’ll sleep on the floor
not necessary penny and i are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed
word of warning though i’m prone to night terrors so if i wake up kicking and screaming don’t panic just pin me down and stroke my hair and i’ll be fine
hey can i stay here tonight
shhshhshhshh sheldon’s asleep what’s going on
well howard’s a complete and total ass bernadette’s in my bed and no matter how much you stroke amy’s hair she bites
never mind can i stay here or not
so how do you wanna do this
well i’m not getting in bed with him
yeah it is a little like getting into dracula’s coffin
we’re just gonna have to make the best of this
okay when you say make the best of it
right so we’ll just call the middle here the neutral zone
star trek you know the neutral zone between the federation and the romulan empire
oh okay just like old times
of course sometimes the federation and the romulans would enter the neutral zone to negotiate a temporary truce
sweetie let me put this in a way you’ll understand from the waist down my shields are up
got it got it we can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up you know
please tell me you’re not having coitus
can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night
oh my god i’m crying already
knock knock knock raj knock knock knock raj knock knock knock raj i need to sleep here tonight
howard is a complete and total ass bernadette is in penny’s bed amy bites and penny may or may not have coitus with leonard
i really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight
i’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up
right still mad at me about that
no no i understand i got too intense you had to back off
i’ve gotten a lot better at that you know i’ve dated four different women since we broke up and i didn’t tell any of them that i loved them and wanted to have their babies
good night you know maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the neutral zone for just one night oh
hey leonard sheldon kicked me out of the room gave me your key
penny’s here raj whispers to him no we don’t want to watch bridget jones’s diary
good morning and welcome to science and society i’m dr sheldon cooper bs ms ma phd and scd omg right perhaps that joke was a little too hippiedippy for this crowd all right then we’ll begin with opening remarks miss rostenkowski would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society
sure i think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days it’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world as a microbiologist i can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one
interesting i think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry
i think mr wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past but he should know that i am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants
are we talking about women wanting penises because i’d like to weigh in
dr koothrappali would you care to join the conversation
certainly i’d like to raise two points number one i think they are talking about penises and number two these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass
i’d like to kick your little brown ass
oh i don’t know maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed
i did you said no bridget jones
we weren’t getting back together it was a onetime thing
excuse me we’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet
all right why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic
let me ask you something bernie
how would you feel if you met my exgirlfriend and she was like angelina jolie
oh come on howard be realistic
what i’m not hot enough for angelina jolie
i’d like to weigh in here no
all right why don’t we open it up to qa from the audience
yeah i have a question is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to los angeles tonight
i’m driving back to la tonight
um penny that’s glenn glenn that’s penny
red leader to red five red leader to red five anybody up for a little game i spy with my little eye a nonferrous metal howard throws walkietalkie out of window
leonard can i ask you a question
are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man i’ve ever seen in my life
because we’re going 120 miles per hour
all right if no one’s going to guess i was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back
good evening i’m your guest lecturer dr sheldon cooper i was expecting applause but i suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate i agreed to speak to you this evening because i was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates hmm of course that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom ‘cause you see there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom best and brightest my sweet patootie all right let’s begin show of hands who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators don’t kid yourselves
i found another tweet from a student at sheldon’s lecture dr cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable plus he looks like a giant insect
look listen to this one does einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun but when you’re listening to dr cooper it falls out of the sky dead
ooh somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their flickr account
wow how do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time
apparently if you’re sheldon all you need to do is turn your back
hey leonard is your wifi down i can’t get on
oh sheldon changed the password it’s now penny is a freeloader no spaces
thanks what are you guys doing
sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight we’re reading the reviews
well picture the hindenburg meets chernobyl meets three mile island meets tron 2
listening to dr cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
good evening leonard howard raj freeloader
oh yes you should have seen those young people thirsty for knowledge drinking in my wisdom i may have changed a few lives today
oh please let me tell him
i don’t know i kind of promised howard
actually we should all share the moment raj if you would
oh tweets about my lecture hmm that’s rather unfair that’s downright cruel plus insects have six legs yeah i’m not familiar with the acronym kmn
oh uh from the context we think it means kill me now
well i suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion i think i’ll turn in i didn’t want to teach those poopy heads anyway
fyi i think that’s what darth vader said just before he started building the death star
yeah it’s weird even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place being rejected by those students really hit him hard
mmm i know the feeling it’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you itit happened to a friend of mine
yeah leonard and i are fine but i think raj needs to meet a girl really soon
well that shouldn’t be too hard he’s such a cutie
thank you but cute is for bunnies i want to be something with sex appeal like like a labradoodle
we might be starting to zero in on your problem
don’t you listen to them you’ve got plenty of sex appeal
well thanks bernadette and just for the record labradoodles are hypoallergenic which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander
it’s a charming illusion but it does not cheer me up
not even when i do this pretends to be a fish
well that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy
do you realize that teaching is the first thing i’ve failed at since my illfated attempt to complete a chinup in march of 1989
if this humiliating experience is really troubling you there are things we could do about it
well the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser
hmm no one slip of the hand and suddenly i’m sitting in the engineering department building doodads with wolowitz
all right have you considered improving your socialization skills thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people
isn’t that their burden i’m the one with something interesting to say
fair enough but in its essence teaching is a performance art in the classroom paradigm the teacher has the responsibility to communicate as well as entertain and engage
i sense that you’re trying to slowwalk me to an epiphany would you mind very much jumping to it
perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons
acting lessons interesting it might help if i could act as though i care about my students and whether or not they learn
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
you’re an finger quotes actress correct
i’m not an finger quotesactress i’m an actress
all right you’re an actress i need you to teach me
perhaps two i’d like to master the craft
okay where is this coming from
it has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing at which if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed i suck the big one
yeah i saw those they were funny i printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge
okay just to be clear you are asking me for help because i know something that the brilliant dr sheldon cooper doesn’t
i suppose that’s one way to look at it
i think it’s the only way to look at it
are you going to help me or not
probably i’m just enjoying the foreplay does this mean you are done mocking my acting career
oh i’m sorry i thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road
i just got offered a fellowship at the weitzmann institute in israel
i know the only thing is i’m gonna be gone for two years
aw i’m gonna miss you are you going with him
i have to stay here for school
that’s what we’re here to talk to you about you see bernadette has needs
most of them regular some of them kind of messed up
so while i’m gone you’re going to have to satisfy her
what ya thinking so hard about
just that i’m definitely not gay
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
yes in preparation for today’s studies i read stanislavski’s an actor prepares stella adler’s
well good for you come on in
well i thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises you know get our bodies warmed up a little
so i just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space you know just do whatever feels natural sheldon
you said to do whatever feels natural this feels natural certainly more natural than what you’re doing
come on you got to work with me we need to get connected with our bodies
penny my body and i have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool wary distance from each other
all right let’s just say we’ve warmed up
okay one of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous so why don’t we try some improvisation
why not it seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum
this is all about listening and responding
i’m going to create a character and a situation and you just jump in when you feel it
okay it’s not a movie it’s improv so no one calls action
hey you taught me something who would have thought it
okay uh no the shipment has not arrived and i really need those shoes they are my biggest seller yes ladies sizes six through ten thank you oh sorry i have to go i have a customer byebye hi can i help you
i’d like a frozen yogurt please
um okay sure luckily we sell both shoes and yogurt here
yes look up at the sign and remember improv is always about saying yes
all right yes i see a sign it says camarillo state mental hospital
it’s the only explanation i can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt
okay you know what let’s just try a different improv uh oh this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass
oh and we’re going to use props
you bet i had dreams you know i was gonna be famous show everybody back home i could be someone now look at me want some
i’m still not adjusted to how the syfy channel spells their name now syfy that’s siffy
hello oh my god is he okay
hang on hang on uhhuh okay thank you howard was on his scooter and got hit by a truck he’s in critical condition
did you hear isn’t it terrible
they wouldn’t let me in oh my howie
it’ll be okay it’ll be okay
it’ll be okay it’ll be okay phone rings it’s howard howard hello
yeah i’m right here buddy how are you
shh shh listen to me i’m not gonna make it
no no no don’t say that you’re going to be all right
raj i don’t have time now pay attention my last wish is that you look after bernadette
of course of course now when you say look after you mean…
excuse me bernadette i have to hear it from him
got it take care i guess i have no choice but to make sweet guiltfree love to you over and over again for the rest of my life
so did you get a chance to go over the scene i gave you
yes i didn’t care for it
okay cat on a hot tin roof is an american classic
so is the mcrib sandwich i don’t care for that either
fine what would you rather do as a scene study
i’m glad you asked i took the liberty of adapting a star trek fan fiction novella i wrote when i was ten into a oneact play
and you think it’s better than tennessee williams
why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide
where no sheldon has gone before
it’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of east texas to the 23rd century where his genius is not only appreciated but celebrated
now in this pivotal scene sheldon’s mother played by you argues with an emissary of the united federation of planets mr spock the role i will bring to life
okay that’s fine but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone
why would we want to do that it’s called the comfort zone for a reason
okay the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little so i’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother and i will bring life to mr spock
very well i’ll set the scene
east texas a warm summer night a woman mary stands on a porch in the distance we hear a lonesome train whistle woowoo the droning buzz of cicadas zzzzzzzzz a coyote howls at the moon frightening sensitive young boys everywhere awawaw out in the woods an owl screeches
okay okay we get it you set the scene
now just read your mother’s line
shelly shelly how many times have i told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch goodness i’ll never understand that boy but then again i’m a religious nut and my mind is closed to so many things
woowoowoowoowoowoo spock to enterprise transport successful
glory be to heaven some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air george put down that pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one and get your shotgun
greetings mary cooper i am spock
i’m sorry i just don’t buy it
oh my your sudden appearance startles me
we have been monitoring your son sheldon from the 23rd century and we have determined that he is now ready to join us his unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy
i understand oh shelly a man’s here to take you away to the future be sure to pack clean underwear”
okay okay let’s try that last line again and this time maybe try choking up a little
yes but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up so much
all right come on just try it my way pretend you’re sad to see him go i’m gonna lead you in his unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy that’s your cue
i’m sorry i just love that line even the way you do it
all right come on come on put some real emotion into it blahblah blah blah vast and troubled galaxy go
oh shelly a man’s here to take you away to the future be sure to pack clean underwear
that’s good that’s good that’s good
mommy why are you crying ‘cause i’m gonna miss you shellybean even though you creep the bejeezus out of me
okay i guess we’re improvising now
well i’m sorry it’s not my fault i’m just incredibly smart and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks oh now don’t you start crying you get in that spaceship mommy’s late for indian bingo
mrs cooper hey it’s penny yeah i think i broke your son hey hold on talk to your mother
mommy i love you don’t let spock take me to the future
okay raj i know you’ve been avoiding me and howard and i’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours
like the wild elephant i am trumpeting my love for you
like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view
my heart burns for you like the sun at noon
my desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon
dance number aside i’m so not gay
here’s what i wonder about zombies others all groan what happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat they can’t starve to death they’re already dead
you take this one i spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror
wellgroomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other case closed
i guess it depends on the zombies raj are we talking slow zombies fast zombies like in 28 days if those zombies didn’t eat they starved
you’re thinking of 28 days later 28 days is where sandra bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
hey don’t bag on sandra bullock you think it makes you look cultured but you just come off as bitter
why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria
perhaps he’s emulating shakespeare’s henry v who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects course if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred emails i’ve sent him on the subject of his administration he could have saved himself the trouble
or maybe he heard it’s tator tot tuesday that’s why i’m here
that depends how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder
sorry dr cooper i forgot you have a touch phobia
it’s not a touch phobia it’s a germ phobia if you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves
yeah so listen fellas who’s up for a little party this saturday night open bar good eats might even be a few pretty girls
hold on just because the nice man is offering you candy doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van what’s the occasion
just a little fundraiser for the university
aha the tearstained air mattress in the back of the van
i understand your reticence dr cooper and i sympathize but the hard facts are occasionally we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research
i don’t care it’s demeaning and i refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the texas state fair which by the way is something you don’t want to attend wearing a star trek ensign’s uniform
all right let me put it this way you’re gonna put on a suit you’re gonna come to this party and you’re gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people or i swear to god i’ll blind you with a hot spoon like they did to that little boy in slumdog millionaire
so saturday night it’s gonna be off the hook
oh boy tator tots and a party invitation what a great day
are you sure this is right
yeah just tuck that part in your pants  you’ll be fine
okay let’s go smooch some rich wrinkled tuckus
oh howard i can’t believe bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey
excuse me my girlfriend doesn’t pick out my clothes my mother does
really what do we tell siebert
tell him dr cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of god
sheldon it’s saturday night you’ll be doing laundry
don’t tell him that tell him the mask thing
hey put your tie back in your pants
nice place reminds me of my parents’ house back in new delhi
no we are very wealthy but the only difference is we have more servants
more than we can use you see in india we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams
ah there’s my band of brainiacs where’s dr cooper
he’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of god
the board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind i think he’s just bananas come on let me introduce you to one of the university’s leading donors
i think we were misled about the cute girls
mrs latham i’d like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers this is dr leonard hofstadter dr rajesh koothrappali and howard wolowitz
well what happened to you wolowitz couldn’t stick with it long enough to get your phd
i’m an engineer most engineers don’t bother with a phd but you may be interested to know i designed the zerogravity wastedisposal system for nasa
got it you’re a space plumber
i’m gonna go hit the bar
dr hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight i think you’ll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work
they’re cute when they’re about to wet themselves aren’t they i’ll make it easy for you when you arrive at the lab in the morning what sort of machine do you turn on
all right dr kooth… uh whatever it is you’re up
it’s koothrappali i have to tinkle
and so instead of bowing to pressure and going to that pointless soiree i stayed right here and did a load of whites
well normally i respect your macho rebellious attitude toward the man but in this case i think you’ve made a foolish mistake
unlikely but make your case keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our saturday night together and i’m not above minimizing your window
sheldon like it or not until you manage to upload your intelligence into a selfsustaining orbiting satellite equipped with highspeed internet and a cloaking device you will be dependent on other members of the human race
that’s it prepare to be minimized
i’m not finished all scientists have to fundraise sheldon how do you think i paid for my lab
your lab is funded by some middleeastern dilettante
technically faisal is my fiance but i do have a stateoftheart twophoton microscope and a place to stay in riyadh for the winter
well that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your facebook page
and consider this without you to make the case for the physics department the task will fall to people like leonard and rajesh
are you trying to scare me ‘cause you’re succeeding
well then prepare to be terrified if your friends are unconvincing this year’s donations might go to say the geology department
oh dearnot not the dirt people
or worse it could go to the liberal arts
millions of dollars being showered on poets literary theorists and students of gender studies
on the bright side i don’t think president siebert will be making us go to any more fundraisers
it was so much easier at my bar mitzvah the old people just came up to you pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond
oh don’t be such gloomy gusses look at the size of these shrimp at what point do we start calling them lobsters
face it raj we crashed and burned tonight
oh you didn’t do that badly
mrs latham the first machine i turn on in the morning is the heliumneon laser ’cause it needs to warm up
i no longer care dear but don’t worry i really enjoyed meeting you this evening
you’re kidding that was good for you ‘cause i was sweating through my tshirt
excellent there’s nothing i like better than making smart people feel ill at ease
oh i don’t know it’s one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money watch hey who said you could eat that shrimp see fun
no no no i’m just here for your money i don’t want to shake anyone’s germy hands explain it to them siebert
i must confess i don’t understand you president siebert first you say you want me to appear at your fundraisers but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fundraisers forgive me but that sounds like a mixed message here we go again if there’s simply no talking to me why did you call i’m sorry someone’s on the other line why don’t you see if you can organize your thoughts and we’ll try again later cooperhofstadter residence go for cooper
hello mrs latham yes i live with him i don’t i i really don’t know why tonight sure that’d be great okay i’ll i’ll see you then bye she wants to have dinner and talk about my research
an entire dinner to talk about your research where you going the drivethru at jack in the box
well wherever we’re going she’s sending a car to pick me up
my stature intimidates her so she’s using you to get to me crafty old gal
excuse me but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment i’ve been published in peerreviewed journals i received a dissertation of the year award for experimental particle physics
no that can’t be it and since you seem to have forgotten the reason we live together is we’re best friends and i got your back jack
the only time i eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner
you kind of remind me of her she enjoys making people uncomfortable too
well you remind me of a boy i dated in college
sweet boy very smart if only he’d had money
yeah um so hey speaking of money how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve
well i must say you make a very persuasive case for it
and i’m seriously considering taking it to the next level
terrific great what level is that she grabs him and kisses him okay now you don’t remind me of my mom
i’m sorry so eventually zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where sandra bullock is
you know it’s a shame all that work she’s doing to get sober only to be torn apart and eaten alive
swell i need a drink do we have any alcohol
no but we have potatoes i could make you vodka it’ll take two weeks
well mrs latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump
then she stuck her tongue down my throat
okay we can’t keep explaining everything read that book we got you
waitwaitwait are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars
you’re really a broken toy aren’t you
i was able to get out of there before anything else happened but she wants to see me again tomorrow night
excellent what are you planning to wear
penny you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain walk him through this
well nno hold on a second i’m not going to sleep with her
but we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump
well forget it it’s not gonna happen
well come now leonard this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science
what was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain
it was a compliment i believe in giving credit where credit is due
okay fine i’ll tell him leonard mrs latham’s car is here for you
i won’t be too late i’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night
hold on i have something for you
just a few things you may need tonight there’s uh baby oil condoms and uh a little something i procured from the school of pharmacology they say it is to viagra as viagra is to a green mm
i am not going to have sex with her
maybe this will overcome your reluctance i went on the internet and found a photograph of a 25yearold mrs latham to get your libido humming check out those saddle shoes rar
are you insane i’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment
given how much time you spend engaging in pointless selfabuse you might consider just this once using your genitalia to actually accomplish something
he still won’t shag the old lady huh
no but thank you for asking
hello leonard i hope you’re hungry
i’m very hungry for food right
oh i made you uncomfortable last night i’m so sorry
no it most certainly is not leonard i’m making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us
well of course there’s no quid pro quo here you and your colleagues are doing remarkable research and you deserve the money
oh then what was last night about
i took a shot sue me
you’re a very handsome man leonard
it was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me
oh don’t say that you’re a very attractive woman
well aren’t you sweet just for the record you’d remember a night with me for the rest of your life
i’m sure i would but why why exactly
you’re a very smart man how do you think i landed such a rich husband
i hadn’t really given it much thought
oh please i recognize the walk of shame when i see it all you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it
oh nothing’s going on excuse me
i’m so proud of you you sold yourself out like a common streetwalker
no i didn’t do it for the money
i believe that’s what your roommate did to her
again read the book we gave you
no i mean i i i got the money first
smart get paid up front yeah i think you have a real knack for gigolo work leonard
uh i’m gonna go lie down
that’s a good idea get your rest there are a lot more rich old ladies out there and daddy needs a new linear accelerator and i thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you
another compliment learn to recognize them
ah there he is the man of the hour he took one for the team
i didn’t do it for the money
keep telling yourself that it makes it easier trust me i know
nothing just thinking about the noises people make during sex
i do sometimes get a bit carried away don’t i
it’s cute you sound a little like a drunken monkey oohoohoohooh
you know it’s meant as a compliment
this is perfect i hope this moment never ends
oh already why don’t you stay over
well i’d love to but you know my mother needs me in the morning
please i think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself
it’s not just the wig it’s pinning her hair up drawing on her eyebrows it’s a twoperson job
it’s just when you leave right after we make love it makes me feel cheap
oh honey i’m sorry what can i do
okay like what another five ten minutes
howard have you ever considered us living together
boy i don’t know you me ma living under the same roof
no i mean just you and me you can move in here or we can find a place
we wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats then we just stick her in the ground flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom
look at us planning a future together
who’s there are you a sex criminal
sex criminals don’t have keys ma
i know what that means i watch dr phil i hope to god you used a condom
i’m not having this conversation with you ma
god forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases
i hope not i share a toilet with you is that what you want to give your mother herpes
that’s it i don’t have to take this good luck with your eyebrows in the morning
who’s there are you a sex criminal
i’m still leaving i just forgot my claritin
i need a place to crash
still arguing over which csi is the best
no we agreed they all have their merits this was about bernadette
howard’s gonna sleep here tonight he had a fight with his mother
did you offer him a hot beverage
leonard social protocol states when a friend is upset you offer them a hot beverage such as tea
you heard the man leonard and while you’re at it i’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest so make me cocoa point of inquiry given that leonard is your secondary friend and koothrappali is your primary friend why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof
there’s no room his sister is staying with him
cocoa leonard focus i’m down in the dumps here
yeah some work thing anyway my mother seems to think that bernadette…
hold on when did priya get here
i don’t know a couple of days ago the thing is bernadette doesn’t like that i have to take care of my mother and my mother doesn’t trust bernadette
yeah that’s a real pickle bye
don’t worry as your tertiary friend i am prepared to step in and comfort you
no no i’ll finish making the tea while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you
that’s what tertiary friends are for
i just want to talk to her
you heard me i forbidded it
get out of the way what are you doing here
i have business in los angeles
clearly she was sending you a message to take a hike mike
i’m sorry i thought about calling but i just wasn’t sure if seeing you was such a good idea
i know last time i came on too strong can we talk in private
it’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private if you insist on talking you must do it on the couch all right you may talk in the bedroom but i want this door to remain open all right just this once you may close the door but keep in mind i’ll be right out here monitoring the situation dials phone oh damn it leonard when you get this message call me dials again priya this is your brother when you get this tell leonard to check his voicemail
would you be sleeping over again this evening because you’re welcome to
that’s very nice of you but i made other plans
well just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend i stand at the ready
why are you holding hands i forbid you to hold hands
rajesh you know leonard and i spent the night together
yeah but you were just sleeping because i forboded you to have sex
are you sure that doesn’t sound right
listen rajesh leonard and i have decided to see each other again and you don’t get to tell me who i can and can’t have a relationship with
actually he can the hindu code of manu is very clear in these matters if a woman’s father is not around the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family in this case raj the code also states that if she disobeys she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases if true that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is leonard
there it is priya we’re indian we believe this stuff
i think it also says that if you eat beef you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine
some of it makes sense some of it’s crazy my point is you can’t go out with leonard
who can’t go out with leonard
penny this is raj’s sister priya
it’s very nice to meet you
priya if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness it may stem from the fact that leonard and penny used to if i may quote howard do the dance with no pants
hey bernadette can i talk to you for a second
penny you became disenchanted with leonard as a lover would you please tell my sister why
listen my mom’s going to palm springs to visit her sister that’s two whole nights in a row i can sleep over with you all the way to morning unless the desert air dries out her sinuses in which case i’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier
that’s it that’s your big solution to all of our problems if your mom’s nose holds up we get two nights together
no it’s not great you need to make a choice me or your mother
no wait you didn’t let me finish
i came as quickly as i could
to comfort you of course sheldon told me about leonard dating rajesh’s sister so i hightailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart
you don’t have to be strong for me now let’s talk about priya that manstealing bitch
in situations like this best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman rawr
really i am not upset about leonard and priya
oh then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate arguably much more suitable than you
oh well good for him hey what do you mean more suitable
well granted penny your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious but priya is highly educated she’s an accomplished professional and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex whereas you on the other hand are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows
yeah okay i got it i got it so what is all that stuff
this is a portable electroencephalogram i’m doing research on emotions and brain activity so when you start crying i can see which region of the brain is activated then i’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries cool huh
yep i moved out of my mother’s house cord is cut i’m all yours
what did she say when you told her
i don’t know she hasn’t responded to my email yet
this is so great i love you howard
i love you too so what’s for dinner
well i don’t really have much of anything in the house
that’s fine why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom and then you can go shopping
i thought maybe after we eat we could see an early movie
i love the way you say i’d love that
she says it the same way i do i’d love that everybody in india says it that way it’s not a big deal
i’m not being a child leonard i swear to god if your sister ever comes to town i shall have my way with her
all the more shame that will fall upon the house of hofstadter
ooh i thought i smelled pizza
that’s remarkable if pepperoni were an explosive substance you could replace german shepherds at our nation’s airports
oh yes hi hi i’m sorry i didn’t know you had company i don’t want to impose
no no it’s not an imposition at this point in our ecosystem you are akin to the plover a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles please fly into our open maw and have at it
if i had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator i wouldn’t have to take that
hi so um priya you’re a lawyer right
oh come on it’s not boring at all she’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology hmm
thank you leonard that doesn’t make it sound boring at all
oh who are you kidding she’s breathtaking
so penny leonard tells me you’re an actress that must be pretty exciting
oh yeah yeah it’s real great today i drove to van nuys for an audition i thought was going to be for a cat food commercial turned out to be porn
given the state of your career can you really afford to be picky
i took acting classes when i was at cambridge i loved it we did taming of the shrew
oh wow i love taming of the shrew i did a paper on it in high school who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting in his tail
yours if you talk of tails and so farewell
what with my tongue in your tail
i’m regretting my earlier cattiness she is an absolute delight
i can’t believe we’re finally living together
yeah you know what would make this moment perfect
a little snack you got any string cheese
no i i might have some cheddar
not as good you can’t make strings with it remind me to put it on your shopping list
better put it on the list if you wash my underwear with regular soap i get little red bumps on my tuchus
wait a second i’m doing your laundry
well honey it’s not gonna do itself oh before i forget tomorrow morning you’re driving me to the dentist
you don’t have to take me you get to take me
wait a minute are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist
it’s not weird there’s lots of kids there with their moms
what it’s fun if i have no cavities afterwards we go out for a treat
all right howard let’s get something straight right now i’m not going to be your mother
whoa whoa whoa where did that come from
who’s that is it a sex criminal
nobody wants to do that to you ma
you know i can’t turn on that ferkakta computer i left you some brisket on the kitchen counter
remember to floss after we have the dentist in the morning
i just wanted to check in on you
it seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched bengal tiger
i already told you i’m okay with it i mean if anything i’m quite pleased starting to blub that leonard has found someone starting to blub that makes him so happy
now let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours
they went to catalina for the weekend
i’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away
oh okay well i guess it’s just the two of us huh
actually it’s the three of us
what up bestie good news thanks to you i was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist
sheldon you have a guest who’s upset
oh sweetie it’s okay i don’t want tea
buona sera luigi’s pizza buona sera it means good evening in italian may i say having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante
un momento oh for heaven’s sake now you’re being deliberately stupid to leonard where are you going
i’m having dinner with priya at raj’s i think howard’s going to be there you want to join us
but tonight’s thursday on thursdays everybody comes over here and has pizza or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be luigi but who sounds suspiciously like jackie chan
can’t we make a onetime exception for tonight
we could we could also stop using the letter m but i think that idea is isguided and oronic
just come with me to raj’s
well i don’t want to go to a party
it’s not a party it’s the same group of people who hang out here hanging out over there
i’m sorry but five people eating and chatting is a party
how come it’s not a party when we do it here
i don’t know what to tell you sheldon i’m going to see priya everyone’s over there you coming or not
well no sir and do you know why in a word tradition every thursday night for the last eight years you and i and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce discuss the issues of the day and yes share a laugh or two but i guess our rich heritage means nothing to you
i guess you’re right see you later
wait leonard wait what am i going to do for dinner
come with me to raj’s and eat there
i can’t do that what if he serves haggis and blood pudding
i really doubt that’s what he’ll serve
but what if he does i’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach and frankly blood pudding is essentially the same thing i don’t know why he’s serving both
what do you want to do you want to come with me or do you want to sit here alone
no i’ll go to your haggis party but i’m telling you this is adness this is utter and coplete adness
raj’s television i just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper lefthand corner
so don’t watch tv read a book
and be a social pariah oh you know that’s not my style
the audible sigh is a show of exasperation right
is it about me or the dead pixels
hey you’re just in time we made texmex
oh indians making texmex might as well have had the chinese pizza
that’s got to be fun for you huh watching hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth
excuse me before this evening goes any further we need to decide where everyone is going to sit
there is no assigned seats sheldon just sit anywhere make yourself comfortable
oh what fun we’re like hippies at a lovein
yeah right on man right on oh look it’s harry potter and 98 of the sorcerer’s stone
okay we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins so you make your own
do you want a margarita sheldon
a margarita where are we what is happening
oh hey sheldon what can i get ya
water neat with a little umbrella
sadly penny this evening i am the dark knight roaming these mean streets alone a windbreaker for my cape and a stern expression for my cowl
excuse me isn’t this the point where the worldweary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron
well i was getting your stupid umbrella but all right what’s troubling you buddy
i don’t think your heart’s in it but since you asked apparently because leonard is dating raj’s sister we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment
indeed yeah at one point raj put on reggae music and his sister took off her shoes it was like the last days of caligula phone rings oh i have to get this umbrella
wonder what she’s exasperated about hello
sheldon are you all right when last we spoke you were going to take a taxi home from raj’s but according to facebook you just checked in at the cheesecake factory
yes i was in a taxi but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license so i leapt out and ran for it
there you go just like recovering alcoholics drink in the caribbean
oh hi amy how you been
fine from this angle i can see up your nose
yeah it’s a great time to be alive isn’t it
don’t worry my problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking
look sheldon leonard is dating priya she is staying with raj that means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more
penny i’m sorry you got dragged into this i know you’re devastated that your exboyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless caramelcoloured skin
okay i’m not upset about leonard and priya
sheldon look at me i think it’s time to face the fact that leonard is the nucleus of your social group where he goes the group goes
leonard the nucleus that makes no sense i’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time
i’m not saying that you’re not fun you’re the most fun person i know
a lot of people think i’m fun to be around
don’t be needy bestie that’s probably part of what chased leonard away what i am saying sheldon is that your group is leonardcentric if it were a town it would be leonardville if it were an islamic nation leonardstan if it were the birthplace of motion pictures we’d all be singing hooray for leonardwood
ooh i got one if you guys were a band you’d be called leonard and the leonards
you do realize everyone’s eating at raj’s again tonight
i didn’t say the snacks were for you now did i nosy rosie
yes must be killing you wondering who fine i’ll tell you stuart from the comic bookstore barry kripke from the university penny’s exboyfriend zack and tv’s levar burton
okay well tell him i loved him on star trek
please leonard stop trying to horn in on my new friends
we had a good run you and i
but change is a part of life
okay i have guests coming i’m afraid i’m going to have to ask you to leave now
don’t make this harder than it is leonard
and goodbye to you sir he’ll be back
of course i’ll be back i live here
well it would appear levar burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started um i thought we’d begin by going around the room introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here okay i’m sheldon uh for regular readers of the new england journal of high energy physics i need no introduction if you’re not familiar with that publication there’s a free copy in your goody bag stuart
um hi i’m stuart i run a comic bookstore which for financial reasons i’m currently living in and i guess what i’m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower
i’m zack and i’m uh… uh… could you come back to me
i’m barry kwipke and i’m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle when is the whaffle
patience patience barry the whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an eveninglong festival of fun and folly
yes you must be present to win
okay i’m ready i’m zack and i’m uh… oh crap why is this so hard
we’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out
parenthetical the term kidnap is being used playfully
good now put this pillowcase over your head
she used to be much more fun until leonard punched her in the heart
we just thought you might want to go out and have a good time maybe go dancing
oh gee thanks but i’m not really in the mood
you do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your exboyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of mumbai
okay look if i agree to go out with you guys will you promise to stop pestering me about leonard and priya
all right i’ll go change come on in
if you’d have let me bring the chloroform we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibberjabber
anyway after we get done snowboarding i go back to the lodge and get in the jacuzzi there’s no one around so naturally i’m freeballing it next thing i know this beautiful chick shows up drunk out of her skull wants to get in with me
question was it a jacuzzi or a hot tub
jacuzzi is a commercial brand hot tub is the generic term ie all jacuzzis are hot tubs but not all hot tubs are jacuzzis
is that like all thumbs are fingers but not all fingers are thumbs
nice now what exactly are toes
can you please get back to the drunk girl i’d like something to think about in the shower
oh yeah right anyway she takes off all of her clothes climbs into the hot tub and the first thing i notice…
of course it did it’s said that archimedes the ancient greek mathematician discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath
tewwific go ahead zack naked dwunk girl fweeballing continue
forgive me but i think you’ll find my story is more interesting
does yours have wet bweasts in it
better it has a gold crown you see the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged archimedes with coming up with the solution because the crown was irregularly shaped there was no way to mathematically determine its volume but while bathing archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose
so long story short i nailed her
when he finished he shouted eureka
no i always shout holy moly don’t know why just do
all right that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening who’s ready to play some vintage video games and tonight’s selections include colecovision’s smurf rescue in gargamel’s castle atari’s cookie monster munch and for you text adventure aficionados zork pick me pick me i’m fun
that all sucks the big haiwy meatball how about i go get the kawaoke machine out of my car get plastered and blow the woof off this place
great i’ll make a beer run
and i’ll take a shower we’ll meet back here in fifteen
this is delicious where’d you learn to make chili
when i was at university in england my flatmate was from texas
i hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from texas
sheldon is a bit quirky isn’t he
oh please that crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror
did you know that per our roommate agreement i have to wash my feet before i get in the shower and not in the sink we each have special buckets
raj did you ever tell your sister about the time sheldon got punched by bill gates
nope gates gave a speech at the university sheldon went up to him afterwards and said maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in africa you could have put a little more thought into windows vista”
bam right in the nose made me proud to own a pc
i’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful sheldonfree evening
cheers you realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast
why is it called a toast
oh the ancient romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls
so where do you guys want to go dancing
we were hoping you’d know a place
yes perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh
oh yeah i know that place what do you think
that should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate or a hungry infant
okay let’s go through this one more time just because leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean i need to go out and hook up with some guy
but you could if you wanted to right
pick out the hottest guy in the room take him home do unspeakable things to him then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie
i don’t know it’s fun while you’re doing it and then after it’s mostly embarrassment selfloathing and regret
i would take that deal all day long
yeah well it’s not gonna happen tonight you know for the first time in my life i am not in a relationship and i’m totally okay with it
you know if being on your own is new to you i’d be happy to share some tensionrelieving techniques for ladies i’ve perfected over the years for example do you have an electric toothbrush
it appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic
oh it’s a snowflake from the north pole leonard gave it to me last year
oh god that is so romantic
leonard’s really one of a kind
saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavyhanded don’t you think
let me see that oh screw it i can deal with a little selfloathing let’s go find me a heinie to bite
outstanding and if we fail we can always stop at cvs and pick you out a nice toothbrush i call mine gerard
anybody do walking on sunshine yet
i’m sorry sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave
he actually got pretty good he made us all matching serapes
i still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air
now was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats
long before the cats i think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation i still have some of the currency
knock knock knock all my friends knock knock knock all my friends knock knock knock all my friends
i think it’s like beetlejuice we said his name too many times
hey i thought you were with your new buddies
i had to leave they were having fun wrong
come here sheldon sit here with me
would you like some homemade chili
then it’s not chili real chili has no beans in it but you’re from a foreign land so your ignorance is forgiven
sheldon do you want some or not
yes please your girlfriend’s a little shorttempered
i’d like to propose a toast to friends no matter how quirky
priya do you know why this is called a toast
actually i do i believe the romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls
she’s also a bit of a knowitall mmm this is good whatever it is
mmhmm great hey can i ask you something
last night me wanting to try that stuff out of the kama sutra was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive
yeah just because you’re in bed with an indian woman you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient indian love manual
hey if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys i’d be okay with that
no you have such beautiful eyes have you ever thought about getting contacts
i tried in the seventh grade i could never get used to them
yeah if i had contacts i would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case
if you had them on now you could see what we’re going to do next
ththththat’s okay i can infer from context
hey raj wanna see a new magic trick i’ve been working on
howard if i may interject here with a piece of friendly advice is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time granted you’re just an engineer but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s nobel prize acceptance speech
is the trick making him disappear sure let’s see it
now spread them out on the table face down pick one look at it
now remember your card put it back in the deck
is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate
okay october is the tenth month so ten one plus zero is one plus six is seven turn over the seventh card
it’s not cool it’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons how’d you do it
a magician never reveals his secrets but surely a future nobel prize winner can figure it out
you ever notice when he thinks real hard it smells like bacon
sorry pardon me oh i’m so sorry my fault check it out i just got contacts
one two three four five no way
seven of clubs that is amazing
it’s not amazing all magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet
oh really so how did i do it
well i don’t care how you did it i have more important things to think about clearly the cards are marked
i thought you had more important things to think about
i do you just happen to have caught me on a break oh let me see those cards
oh big deal not knowing is part of the fun
not knowing is part of the fun was that the motto of your community college
hey guys what do you think priya took me clothes shopping
hey you look great good for you priya i could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well you look great
yeah good new contacts i should have done this years ago
so you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis
i’m not going out with him he can sleep with whoever he wants
yeah i was talking to raj
this deck is rigged in some fashion
fine get another deck and i’ll do the trick with that
so you’re saying this is a regulation deck
i’m saying believe in magic you muggle
you know well i’m happy leonard’s found someone not that anybody asked
how many star trek uniforms do you have
uhhuh listen we need to talk about something
oh my god you’re breaking up with me why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me that is so cruel
leonard i’m not breaking up with you
it’s a little weird your exgirlfriend hanging out here all the time
i know i usually never see my exgirlfriends unless their hard drives crash
i’m just saying how would you feel if i was hanging out with my exboyfriend
um not great i guess but penny and i are just friends
i don’t care this is a woman you have slept with if you want her around then i have to wonder if maybe you’re not ready to move on
no nonono i’m ready i gave up the gift of sight for you if that’s not moving on what is
you need to cut the cord with penny
no no i’m confident it’s not like i’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation although this will be the first time i’ll be the one saying it
sure oh god you smell so good of course that could just be my other senses getting stronger hypothetically if i had access to a lieutenant uhura uniform would you wear it
leonard it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe can we not discuss it
and was your card the jack of diamonds
oh unbelievable know how he did it yet
aw he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how i got his nose
you know i have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed like ooh look the pencil’s rubber
hey i think i know how you did the card trick
oh oh please if i don’t know you don’t know that’s axiomatic
not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means
hey you what happened with the contacts
one of them’s upstairs the other one sort of slipped back into my skull
hey is that one of the new shirts priya got you
no that’s silk seriously what would you do without me
you know i gotta tell you i think you got a real winner with priya
she seems really sweet believe me you do not want to take that for granted there are a lot of bitches out there
all right well i’ll see you later
uh penny there’s something i have to tell you
okay uh how do i put this um are you familiar with darwin’s observation of the finches in the galapagos islands
did they make a movie about it
all right well anyway darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else
so what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives
uh a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
sure that has birds in it
it’s fun talking to you leonard i always learn stuff
i’m sorry but i’m gonna count that
do you really have to wear that in bed
yeah the doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night it was either this or one of those giant neck cones
so did you get to talk to penny
she completely understood everything i said case closed
maybe but that’s not my problem she’s not my girlfriend you are
i hope you weren’t cruel to her
is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die or is that just nature’s way
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
i think i figured out wolowitz’s magic trick and i need you to pick a card
i am not opening that door sheldon
as you wish cards slide under door pick a card put it back and prepare to be amazed leonard does not did you pick one
sliding card under door is this your card
pick a card sheldon now look at it and put it back in the deck now do you remember your card of course i do i have an eidetic memory my apologies now shuffle the cards shuffling wait here processing image crossreferencing
i’m reverse engineering wolowitz’s magic trick
what’s up with the infrared cameras
i’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched by the way if you hope to have children i suggest you switch from briefs to boxers your testicles look a tad warm
holy crap are you connected to the oak ridge national laboratory
yes i’m using their cray supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns
sheldon that computer is used for national defence hacking into it is a federal crime
relax we’re not under attack right now
okay i’m leaving before the black helicopters get here
and is this my card rats i wonder if howard used a radioactive tracer where am i going to find uranium235 this time of night come on craigslist
is it racist that i took you to an indian restaurant
it’s okay i like indian food
or as you probably call it back home food
why didn’t you wear your contacts don’t you like them
no no i do it’s just i knew i was having curry tonight and i only want one part of my body to burn at a time
you know my company offered me a position here in los angeles
does that mean you’d relocate here permanently
oh  i love it oh that’s great
you did talk to her didn’t you
of course i did i talked and talked and talked
hey look at leonard in his fancyass grownup clothes way to go priya for once he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department hey did he tell you i saved the silk shirt
he was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his spiderman underwear that’s our lenny huh
so how’s the food here oh wow that is really really good oh i’m sorry you guys are on a date we can hang out anytime have fun
oh that’s hot hot hot hot whoo it really sneaks up on ya huh all right i gotta go
oh i’ve been meaning to tell you i figured out your magic trick
oh yes in fact i improved upon it
i’d love to see that how about you raj
beefaroni and a show how do you turn that down
what’s with the wand and the beep
the wand is called showmanship and the beep is none of your business oh excuse me i’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick oh look my dry cleaning’s ready and your card was the five of spades tada
these cards have barcodes on them the wand is a reader it’s transmitting to your phone
that’s pathetic let me show you how a real magician does it raj take a card don’t let me see it
son of a gun you’re blowing my mind
that does it i’m getting uranium
maybe when it stops being fun
oh hey i was just on my way to work
oh okay it’s not important it can wait
no it’s all right walk me down so what’s up
uh i kind of have a problem i was hoping you could help me with
well uh not far hey if you ever wanna start a family la cañada has some great schools
okay i’m not moving anywhere what the hell is this all about
why does it have to be about anything can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate no questions asked
oh for god’s sake leonard this is about priya isn’t it she doesn’t want me hanging out with you
okay look i happen to like your girlfriend
it doesn’t matter look i promise from now on i will keep my distance from you
well now hold on what kind of distance are we talking about because we are neighbours i mean i can hear the toilet flush in your apartment
you can hear my toilet flush
i don’t listen for it but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing the building’s plumbing
leonard i get it you’re in a new relationship now and i’m happy for you so why don’t we just shake hands and part friends
well now hold on how about this how about we still hang out but on the downlow
are you really that kind of guy
no i actually felt kinda silly just saying on the downlow
penny wait bumps into door damned contacts
apparently you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the department of homeland security tattling to your mother
oh that’s too bad figure out the magic trick yet
figure out the magic trick yet
want me to tell you how to do it
i’ll show you one more time raj
hang on this time do it with me so i can make sure there’s no monkey business
all right raj looks over sheldon’s shoulder holds two fingers over his heart two of hearts
yeah he’s gonna win the nobel prize
why hast thou forsaken me o deity whose existence i doubt
your friend here called 911 to report a robbery
oh my god what did they get
what didn’t they get they got my enchanted weapons my vicious gladiator armour my wand of untainted power and all my gold
you called the police because someone hacked your world of warcraft account
what choice did i have the mighty sheldor level 85 blood elf hero of the eastern kingdoms has been picked clean like a carcass in the desert sun plus the fbi hung up on me
yes glenn the only bird i ever loved
wait a minute you’re not going to do anything
not the kind with access to drugs
fine dr cooper i’m sorry for your loss but the pasadena police department doesn’t have jurisdiction in pandora
that’s from avatar world of warcraft takes place in azeroth goodness gracious how are you allowed to carry a gun can you at least refer me to a rogue excop
you know one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice
what kind of world do we live in where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich
this act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity it is time to cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
i’m on it on phone hi mrs wolowitz is is howard there okay thanks that particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath
see if raj is done with pilates
three thousand hours three thousand hours clicking on that mouse collecting weapons and gold it’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time
whoever did this knew what they were doing he got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes transferred all your stuff and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint
oh there isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart
hold on i’m talking to an orc under the bridge in thunder bluff who says if we pay him he’ll help us track down your things
i should say so he appears to be a member of the nigerian royal family
whoa somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle
no glenn’s was leather he was a simple ostrich is is i haven’t given up hope
hey penny we’re kind of in the middle of a crisis here
oh i know bernadette told me sorry sheldon i know that game meant a lot to you
that game excuse me penny but doodle jump is a game angry birds is a game world of warcraft is a massively multiplayer online roleplaying… all right technically it’s a game
bad news the nigerian prince may be a fraud
okay well anyways i brought you a dayold cheesecake to cheer you up
stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich
oh hi i was just dropping off a cheesecake to sheldon he was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a makebelieve place
i don’t know what that means
did you know last weekend priya took leonard rollerblading at the beach can you believe that
i feel like i’m supposed to say that bitch but i don’t have enough information
i am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place and he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste i had to carry him to the water
i took howard to the beach once he almost burst into flames like a vampire
so what’s the thanks i get for turning leonard into quality boyfriend material i have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend
want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream
ah here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure mother warned me about i was starting to think it was never going to happen yes please
you guys should’ve seen leonard when i first met him there was no eye contact he was either looking up at the ceiling or down at his shoes
you know for the first couple of months whenever i would take off my bra he would giggle and say oh boy my breast friends
well if it makes you feel any better i’m never speaking to priya again
no don’t do that no reason to be mean to her
this may be the alcohol talking but i believe there is are you familiar with the recent study of tanzanian chimpanzees by nishida and hosaka out of kyoto university
no but i can name all the kardashians
primates such as ourselves have a natural instinct to ostracize illmannered members of the troop bernadette’s urge to shun scowl or fling her waste at priya is hardwired into her dna
i don’t have an urge to fling my waste
believe me it’s there we all have it hit me with some more booze and i’ll show you
all right here we are this is the tavern where all the blackmarket weapon trades go down
i don’t think my character should be in a place like this everyone’s undressing her with their eyes
maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up
okay what exactly are we looking for
redheaded troll goes by the name of glumly according to the message boards if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours he’s your guy
leonard is this going to take much longer i thought we were going to spend some time together
uh we are in the meantime you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us
well you have to put in a credit card number but it’s fun
maybe i should just go home
our troll just walked in i got him
we got him we’re almost done
so how do you guys want to play this
be ruthless you tell him if he doesn’t start talking we’ll register a complaint with his internet service provider
sheldon what if he gets his internet from his cable company he could lose his hbo and all their delightful original programming
i don’t care i’m losin’ it man
why don’t we play this smart try a little good goblin bad goblin
nah i think we have to be more subtle
okay i see where this is going fine i’ll have sex with him
that’s not where it was going
good because i would hate that
leonard you’re busy let’s talk tomorrow
oh wait hang on are you upset
no no i think it’s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man’s body
good good i’ll tell you what happens
and people think i don’t get sarcasm
well well well look who it is
hi we’re just heading out for a drink
count your blessings you’re not a tanzanian chimp
don’t listen to her she’s had a lot of ice cream do you want to join us
oh thank you but i have work to do
four women walk down the stairs how many reach the lobby
did your sister say anything when you got home last night
oh no don’t put me in the middle of this i’m not going to be your gobetween
come on help me out am i in trouble
i’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their exboyfriend sanjay
good news gentlemen i found our hacker
yeah no one can hide from me not waldo not carmen san diego not even topless natalie portman
i’ve never said these words before but good job howard
thanks our culprit is one mr todd zarnecki 2711 ocean view road carlsbad california
the name and the address drip with evil
what else do we know about him
i’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents
yes he does live with his parents here’s a google earth shot of their house
excellent it’s in a culdesac we can box him in
hold on you’re thinking of going there
carlsbad is only a couple of hours away
fine you walk up to the house knock on the door and demand your stuff back what if he says no
i don’t know if you’ve been following the news leonard but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture
fine we’ll abide by the geneva convention but ask yourself this in the course of our lives how much lunch money has been taken from us how many kites how many scoobydoo trapper keepers
i totally had one of those
of course you did it was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work but the bullies took it from us well no more tonight we take back our dignity our birthright and our pride what do you say who’s with me
i have a hiphop aerobics class at five could we go after
also tonight’s the sabbath and my mother and i have a tradition of lighting the candles and
oh geez i don’t know if i can ditch priya two nights in a row
oh come on man bros before… my sister
one moment places a tissue on their hands before adding his own i’m hellbent on catching a cyber criminal not the common cold
i’m sorry i thought this delay was so you could watch wheel of fortune with your mother
i am she’s just bleaching her moustache check it out hey ma before and after four words 17 letters two n’s one v
yeah she’s kind of a wheel savant
sitar music for her ringtone is not cool dude
hit the… hey sweetie yeah i’m sorry i’m gonna be working late i i i miss you too okay sure i’ll call you when i get home okay byebye
very nice you lie to my sister
that’s the nicest thing he does to your sister
hello priya what’s up how would i know if leonard’s at work or not don’t be suspicious look if you want your relationship with leonard to continue you’re going to have to believe whatever wildeyed cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you okay yeah byebye you owe me
new puzzle ma same name one n two d’s three o’s
i know it’s her superpower well that and jiggling her arm fat
i can’t believe we’re going all the way to san diego to confront this guy
yeah we’re kind of badasses aren’t we
hey how about we stay the night and hit legoland in the morning
sea world is better it has shamu who is literally tons of fun but for the moment let’s stay focused on todd zarnecki
yeah we’re coming for you todd zarnecki and for the record legoland is more interactive
i almost feel sorry for the poor fool sitting in his splitlevel suburban ranch unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the san diego freeway at 71 miles an hour ease up there lead foot you trying to get us killed
i took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music
this says beyonce bootylicious dance mix
it’s a rewritable cd just put it in
she’s curvy and she owns it i like that
we are winged fury which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit
next time we go to kick someone’s ass we take the train
no weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a klingon bat’leth
okay let’s get clear on something we’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way no one’s bat’lething anybody
so my blade shall not taste blood tonight
well now i just feel silly holding it
can i at least kick down the door
you’re welcome to try but the other day it took you 15 minutes to get into a fedex box rings bell
don’t say your doom who opens the door for their doom
i am sheldor of azeroth i want my things back
i don’t think so let me see that
i know i’ve always wanted one closes door
well he’s even more cunning than we thought
you know the joke’s on him without the certificate of authenticity that bat’leth is worthless
yeah he walked right into our trap
legoland seems like a hollow dream now
something’s wrong i’m not getting any gas anybody know anything about internal combustion engines
does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine
well we’d better call somebody to come pick us up
it’d be swell if they had a train
no problem so leonard i think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you
uh i kind of told her i was working
so you lied to her also interesting
yeah she doesn’t really understand the whole warcraft adventureroleplaying thing
well doesn’t matter if she gets it as long as she’s pretty
this one’s funny leonard how come you couldn’t make it work with her
so did you at least get sheldon’s fake stuff back
no we failed in our noble quest
i’m gonna show you how we finish a quest in nebraska oh beyonce ride of the valkyries this ain’t no beyonce
give my friend his stuff back
i don’t know what you’re talking about
well then good news today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place kicks him in the groin now give him his stuff back
we did it i said we
amy’s right i do want to fling my poop at her
i’m glad you talked me into this we work so hard sometimes it’s nice to goof off and do something silly
agreed wait till you hear how he dumbs down werner heisenberg for the crowd you may actually believe you’re in a comedy club
you can think about heisenberg’s uncertainty principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain chinese restaurants where you have dishes in column a and other dishes in column b and if you order the first dish in column a you can’t order the corresponding dish in column b that’s sort of like the uncertainly principle
say i heard an interesting tidbit about howard and bernadette
really amy gossip i’m disappointed in you
now now evolutionary biologist robin dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups
what if he’s right and by not participating in gossip society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish
fine in the parlance of the urban music scene what’s the 411
bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard
i believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe excuse me dr greene question
you’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas
have you ever considered trying to do something useful perhaps reading to the elderly
yeah but not your books something they might enjoy i kid of course big fan
thank you my father taught me archery as a child it’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of kmart bourbon
i know what an elf i would have made whoo what do you think you’re doing
really i didn’t see you draw one from your quiver
i’m not going to do that sheldon
leonard the people at nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience we have to do our part too leonard mimes drawing an arrow and stabbing sheldon with it that was uncalled for but i’ll play along ow i had an unusual experience with amy last night
she was attempting to engage me in gossip
yes i think prolonged exposure to penny has turned her into a bit of a gabby gertie
oh please i was just pointing it out i have no desire to engage in the activity
all right get this bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard
oh that’s too bad i wonder what happened
mm it’s hard to say i can only speculate based on the data i collected watching my parents’ marriage implode in that case the woman dives into religion while the man dives into a bottleblonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures oop out of arrows
boy you sure get your money’s worth out of these games
– priya can i come in
it’s okay you didn’t know i’ll take care of it
sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror
it’s a splatter thing there’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind
i know just do it there’s a big inspection coming up and i don’t want to lose my tv privileges
you really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days
mm i don’t know i get a lawyer he gets a lawyer it’s just easier to stand behind the tape
oh by the way a fellow at work said i could use his dodger tickets this weekend does that sound like fun
you’ll need to explain the game to me
mm it’s complicated but as i remember it the essentials are get chosen last get hit by the ball cry go home
well regardless i’ve got four tickets and i was thinking we can bring bernadette and howard she’s really interesting and i bet i can get used to him
well it might not be a great idea to invite those two
don’t tell anybody i told you but i heard she might be breaking up with him
oh too bad although i do know one person for whom that’s good news
my brother he’s got a big crush on bernadette
mmm i found poems he wrote about her very disturbing oh bernadette please play my clarinet
yes and for years everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast hmm what’s that piece of tape
oh that one doesn’t apply to you you sit
not too bad did you hear about howard and bernadette
‘course i heard about it how did you hear about it
i heard about it from sheldon he got it from amy
oh damn it i told amy that in the strictest confidence boy some people are such blabbermouths well whatever i’m sure bernadette can do better
do you think a sexually ambivalent indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundredpound jewish guy who lives with his mom
you are kidding raj likes bernadette
i didn’t say raj who said raj
okay give how do you know did he tell you
priya told you what a little gossip you know not an attractive quality in a woman leonard not judging just my opinion
well the point is if this got out it would destroy howard and raj’s friendship
you don’t have to worry unlike amy and priya i know how to keep a secret
you’re the one who told amy in the first place
hello mummy hello daddy how are you
we’re very rich in a very poor country so all in all can’t complain
so priya how are enjoying staying with your brother
it’s fine but if i’m going to stay in los angeles much longer i think i should get my own place
why is rajesh not making you feel comfortable rajesh why aren’t you making your sister comfortable
i am making her comfortable besides she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway
what where are you sleeping priya
it’s a figure of speech daddy it means ii work late
please tell me you’re not dating an american i knew this would happen rajesh are you letting your sister date that little howard boy
now hold on if she is dating an american that’s not a bad way to go he’s jewish those chaps are very successful and they don’t drink a lot
it it doesn’t matter howard has a girlfriend
is something going on with him and bernadette
you can’t tell by that winona ryder is jewish
okay we’re getting off the subject rajesh i want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome
don’t worry everything i have i share with her including my friend leon…
good night mummy good night daddy
oh my god i think you broke my toe
well you should have kept your mouth shut
fair enough now what’s up with clarinet bernadette
i’ve been thinking about dr greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses
that’s all i’ve just been thinking about it now i’m thinking about fractal equations now i’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought now i’m thinking about trains
are you listening to this guy
hmm oh i’m sorry i was somewhere else
oh no i hope everything’s okay
whatever it is we’re here for you you can tell us anything
i’m gonna ask her to marry me
yeah i just need to figure out the right time to pop the question
oh great it’s my cousin david about the ring hey david what’d you find oh sure a half a carat’s fine her freakishly small hands make anything look big it’s one of the reasons i love her
man he’s going to be blindsided
uh a smile means something different in my country you know tears of joy smile of sadness india’s a goofy place
oh i’m back to trains woowoo
did i tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction
fascinating work i recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes
yes he looks much cooler than the nonsmoking monkeys although it’s not much of a contest the other monkeys just sit around and masturbate
if you don’t mind i’d like to stop listening to you and start talking
howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to bernadette
i don’t understand the original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup
i know the group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating soulcrushing rejection everyone was set atwitter although oddly no one tweeted
it’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends are you familiar with meme theory
i’m familiar with everything but go on
meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host
i’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology at johnson elementary school the phrase shelly cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire
i should think so that’s gold
your meme hypothesis does intrigue me how might we examine this more closely
do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation
it’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that i don’t find repellent
we need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip
and a second nontantalizing piece to use as a control
then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory algebraic gossip and epidemiology
look at you getting me to engage in the social sciences you’re a vixen amy farrah fowler
sheldon and i engaged in sexual intercourse in other news i’m thinking of starting an herb garden mum’s the word gotta go
oh hey raj what are you doing here
i just felt like drinking alone because i’m deep and dark
uhhuh so uh howard’s not here
no it’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me like when the three of us went to the movies and you and i waited outside the bathroom while howard threw up red vines and cherry coke do you remember that
hey 16 wants to order appetizers
what the hell are you doing howard is your best friend and that is his girlfriend you should be ashamed of yourself
i was when i came in but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt besides what you might not know is bernadette is planning on breaking up with howard
well i know that how do you know that
oh that gossipy bitch no offense
none taken you should hear how she talks about you
okay listen just because howard and bernadette are having problems does not mean you should be here sniffing around
what can i do i can’t stop thinking about her
all right try thinking about this sheldon and amy had sex
yeah it’s true amy told me
how did that even happen did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it
ii guess they just figured it out at some point
wow i can’t believe old smelly pooper finally got laid
interesting a friendly sentiment in this country cruel taunt in the sudan it’s a lesson in context
will amy be joining us for dinner
good good everything okay between you two
no reason i was just talking to raj and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days
did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock
no that’s not what he meant
well we may never know as my mother would say the asians are an inscrutable folk now if you’ll excuse me i have work to do
yeah you do you dog you
every word our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda
this is moving faster than we thought
agreed it appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared
i must say amy pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction
slow down sheldon i’m not quite there yet
bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you the meme has reached full penetration
this is remarkable took less than 24 hours
i should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance
interesting so it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow as it were
not important i described your lovemaking as aloof but effective
i wish you hadn’t done that that’s going to make me a chick magnet and i’m so busy as it is
hey everybody i got something i want to ask bernadette and i can’t think of a better time than when i’m with all my friends
oh hold on howard there’s lots of better times
leonard please the man is talking let him get it out and let the chips fall where they may
i know things haven’t been perfect with us and we’ve had our problems but i just have to tell you from the moment i…
howard let me just stop you right here
oh i love you so much
i wonder what changed her mind
perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love
as good an explanation as any
oh hey amy bernadette just texted me howard proposed
yes not important just stopped by to let you know i’m getting orthotics also i’m carrying sheldon’s baby mum’s the word
wow is there anything on there about orthotics
leonard are you in the shower
i can’t hear you i’m in the shower
i asked if you were in the shower but that’s moot now
moot rendered unimportant by recent events
i can’t hear you i’m in the shower
i have to skip the chitchat emergency
mathematical 32ounce banana smoothie 16ounce bladder
you might not want to do that
sheldon i’m not alone in here
what are you doing in there she can’t be in here
we were in here first you can’t be in here
according to the roommate agreement paragraph nine subsection b the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure and believe me i am experiencing a very majeure force
come on you can’t wait two minutes
oh leonard let the man pee
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
dr leonard hofstadter you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement do you waive reading of the charges
hang on no my client does not waive reading of the charges
oh cool i’ve got a lawyer and i’ve seen her naked
very well count the first on or about the 28th day of april the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency to wit my back teeth were floating count the second the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower to wit one unless we are under attack by watersoluble aliens
can i see the roommate agreement
i think i can handle it
top of her class cambridge university licensed to practice law in three countries and your face
all right based on a cursory reading it doesn’t look like you have much of a case sheldon
oh i’m afraid not section seven here on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency
oh that’s ridiculous a bathroom emergency is selfexplanatory
is it if leonard forgot to trim his nose hair could he barge in while you were showering
irrelevant leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair he thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there
my point is sheldon the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it in this case leonard so much for count one
there’s no buts sheldon that’s how the law works
as for the shower capacity issue i cite addendum j when sheldon showers second any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water i believe this supercedes the occupancy issue
no offence but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today
mmm greek food on pizza night this is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to sheldon since we left that fake message from stephen hawking on his voice mail
i wish to discuss your theories of black holes meet me at the randy’s donut by the airport at 2
what is that you’re eating tonight is pizza night
i’d like to refer that to my attorney
according to what i see here thursday nights are franconi’s pizza night
yes and when franconi’s went out of business we switched to graziano’s
that’s interesting can you just switch restaurants like that priya
a good question howard turns out you can’t according to the document you drew up sheldon the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60day comment period were those criteria met
this is greek food leonard you hate greek food
fine i’m nothing if not adaptable
i got you the lamb kabob
thank you if you think about it greek food isn’t that far from italian food they share a spice palette and what a civilization is the greeks they gave us science democracy and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
the mean indian lady tried to make me eat lamb congratulations pizza night will now be at your apartment order one
oh i’m sorry honey i’m meeting amy and bernadette for dinner but you’re welcome to tag along
a girls night oh i don’t know if i’m up for an evening talking about rainbows unicorns and menstrual cramps
okay suit yourself we’ll probably be trashing priya a little
okay i’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out
fair warning we can get kerrazy
yeah last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons
really amy tobacco and alcohol need i remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time
why did you bring him he’s harshing my buzz
i felt sorry for him priya’s giving him a hard time
ooh the priya bashing’s starting early yay okay what’s up with those pantsuits
and that opens her up to justifiable ridicule for wearing them good one bernadette see kerrazy
it’s talc but as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder i understand your confusion
oh i’m not confused at all you’re like a sexy toddler
i don’t know how to process that
i do amy and sheldon sitting in a tree kissssing
that’s too many s’s for kissing
not if they’re doing it for a long time
sheldon have you ever kissed a girl
other than my mother my sister and my meemaw no but in the interest of full disclosure i was once on a bus and had to give mouthtomouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion every year i get a christmas card from her signed with far too many x’s and o’s
that doesn’t count aren’t you even a little curious
yeah you’re a scientist where is the curiosity
thank you not necessary we know everything there is to know about kissing it requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles
oh blah blah blah give me some sugar bestie kisses penny
i’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about aztec human sacrifice
hey i know let’s take sheldon dancing
oh i totally want to see sheldon dance i bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate
no thank you but for the record i’m an excellent dancer proficient in the rumba waltz and chacha
i don’t see why that’s surprising i excel at so many things you’ve had my sourdough bread
against my will in the south preadolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century vienna
oh we are so taking you dancing
no you most certainly are not
well what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree
i saved a nun’s life why am i being punished
take us to a place we can waltz
waltz it’s a social dance from austria choreographed to a threefour time signature sings blue danube the taxi driver says something into radio in korean the word “waltz” is included dispatcher replies also in korean taxi driver sings blue danube dispatcher says “oh waltz” they speak korean some more 
i kissed a girl and i liked it i hope my boyfriend don’t mind it
how come if we’re the smart people we don’t do this every night
my burps taste like cranberry juice
would you like to come in for a nightcap
if you’re referring to the beverage you know i don’t drink if you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle i have one
it’s hard to say no to yoohoo the name literally beckons
don’t be silly he’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study
i’m giving him emphysema the least i can do is let him hang out and watch cable
remarkable aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke
a little the real danger is him biting my face off while i’m sleeping
is he deliberately blowing smoke at me
yeah he’s kind of an ass
thank you may i share something with you that’s troubling me
of course what’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours
priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with leonard making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me
and you want me to kill her done
i trained ricky how to smoke i can train him to shoot a poison dart no jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys
i understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild but i really need to talk to smart amy now
excuse me have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma
what do you think ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory
well when challenged monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing assault and a stylized penile display that’s a little outside my comfort zone
you’re being too literal my point is he would not meekly surrender to the rules and neither should you
are you suggesting i play dirty
yes dirty dirty dirty dirty which brings me to our next order of business kisses him
i hope you don’t take what i’m about to do as a comment on what we just did runs to bathroom and vomits
who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains you really are an ass
oh good you’re up i’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly i’d like you to sign it
why would i want to do that
excellent question do you remember what happened to the alien played by talented character actor frank gorshin in the star trek episode let that be your last battlefield
uh captain kirk activated the selfdestruct sequence and threatened to blow up the enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in
affirmative computer this is dr sheldon cooper activate selfdestruct sequence code 11a2b
what are you gonna do sheldon blow up the apartment
that was my first thought but all my cool stuff is here
so what happens when it counts down
unless leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds this computer will send an email to your parents in india saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiterthanmarshmallowfluff leonard hofstadter
trust me it’s a big deal
they’re gonna find out about me eventually right
yeah of course just not today
then why can’t we tell your parents
he does that all the time doesn’t he 15
okay fine sheldon you win turn it off
this is ridiculous pulls out plug
it’s a laptop with a full charge honestly what do you see in him
give him what he wants or we’re done
you may have gone to cambridge but i’m an honorary graduate of starfleet academy
are you experiencing dehydration headache nausea and shame
yes i also found a korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage what happened last night
ah memory impairment the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle
all right last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes following which you passed out on your bathroom floor i then folded a towel under your head as a pillow set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy and i left
okay don’t really know where we go from here
i suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked
terrific thank you noise of ricky in background they were out of menthols get off my back not easy living with a temperamental little primate
come on priya just admit i embarrass you
you’re preaching to the choir sister
i must say penny this is great fun
until i met you and bernadette my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination now they have a delightful social aspect
amy you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before
of course i have but they were strangers and seemed offput when i engaged in friendly stalltostall chitchat
some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down
the reason i ask is that many people experience bladder shyness the inability to pass urine
yeah i said i’m fine stop talking to me
she always this crabby when she urinates
and i’ll be right by your side
did i tell you priya invited me and howard to have dinner with her and leonard
no it’s not it’s a strategic manoeuvre leonard’s new girlfriend is testing bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group that bitch is crafty
of course how does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests by going after its weakest member
well what makes me the weakest member
your trusting nature coupled with your teenytiny body you wouldn’t last a minute on the serengeti
okay amy you’re being silly i am not concerned about who hangs out with who and i certainly don’t have a problem with leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup ooh these are cute of course if i buy them i’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple
it doesn’t matter i’m going to tell her we can’t make it
oh no you have to go
i don’t understand i thought i was a teenytiny wildebeest
you are with hair that smells like strawberries and we’re going to use that to our advantage
wait what are you talking about
by accepting the invitation bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp she could ferret out priya’s tactics identify her weaknesses and feed her false information such as leonard’s no stranger to backalley cockfights
i don’t know i’m not a very good liar they kind of whup that out of you in catholic school
don’t worry i’ll teach you i did two years of cub scouts before they found out i was a girl
okay i don’t know you people i’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my texaco card
how do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom
i don’t want anything in my ample bosom
come on strawberries take one for the team
good news i finally have a handle on my idea for threeperson chess
uh do you know how i solved the balanced centre combatarea problem five words transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation
it’s what i do but wait there’s more i also invented two new chess pieces the serpent and the old woman
okay now i have to ask what do they do
when the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves ugh
unless it gets to the old woman in time in which case she sucks out the poison turning her into the grand empress a piece combining the power of the knight queen and serpent
okay well i look forward to playing with you
and a third person it’s threeperson chess i must say ever since you started having regular intercourse your mind has lost its keen edge you should reflect on that
excuse me but einstein had a pretty busy sex life
yes and he never unified gravity with the other forces if he hadn’t been such a hound dog we’d all have time machines
yeah yeah i’m just breaking in some new shoes
thank you did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent
please leonard don’t leer you have a girlfriend
so are you off to dinner with priya howard and bernadette
i heard it at the mall when i was shopping with my girlfriends ’cause you know that’s kind of my life now have a good night try not to ogle my caboose as i walk away
hi hey raj will you be joining us for dinner
the lonely guy and the two happy couples i’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers
oh would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself
i have to feel sorry for myself i’m the only one who cares just like i’m the only one who’ll have sex with me
really in front of your sister
we shared a room growing up this is not news to me
excuse me i’m going to go wander the streets alone invisible unwanted and unloved a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart leaves then returns a moment later i forgot my windbreaker it’s chilly
i don’t understand is this a way to break in new shoes
no once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine and i’ll have to wear them walking up and down hollywood boulevard in order to pay them off pretty pretty pretty
bernadette is with priya and leonard message received commence operation “priya wouldn’t wanna beya”
hey seriously didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school
i wish a clique requires friends i didn’t have any
i used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor it was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop hang on it’s the wildebeest priya just made a snide comment about your acting career
wh… what the hell did she say
she thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream no matter what
how do you want to handle it
um okay tell bernadette to tell priya that i’m on my way to prague to shoot a movie with angelina jolie
got it is it going to be in 3d
what i don’t know it doesn’t matter
i’m gonna say 3d that’ll let her know the studio has faith in it
then the studio must have real faith in it
wonder why she didn’t tell me
have you been spending time with your exgirlfriend
then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you
well it’s not as much surprised as uh uh you know uh ththththe other thing
well you know if you if if if you uh i don’t oh what’s the word i’m looking for
i’m not going to help you this is hilarious
thank you befuddled the word i was looking for was befuddled
knight to old woman sixandathird brilliant move thank you knock on door will the two of you excuse me
come on sheldon open the door
i don’t want to hug you
i don’t want to hug you either i was just feeling blue
well not so much depressed as lonely
i don’t know what colour lonely is
red is angry yellow is frightened green is jealous and blue is depressed perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely
nothing rhymes with orange it’s probably lonely
all right come in you look positively orange with loneliness no i don’t see that catching on at all
i’m working on my threeperson chess game
it’s threeperson chess did you bring a friend
then as a mental exercise i invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play threeperson chess can you believe this guy social protocol does however require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need
it’s not optional we’re out of tea i hope you like bouillon
i uh i guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down
actually i was wondering if i could add a third new chess piece how do you think people would feel about prince joey the king’s feebleminded but wellmeaning cousin
i’m going to be 30 years old and i have no one in my life to love me i’m such a basket case i can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body
the fun thing about prince joey is every time he moves there’s a oneinfive chance he’ll kill himself
sheldon listen to me i have a big decision to make and i’m scared
a friend at the school of pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing he says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder
i’m not sure some sort of betablocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows
it was its own point go on
i’m a scientist my ability to think is my bread and butter i’m afraid if i take this i might lose that special unique something that makes me so successful in my field
rajesh i’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years my recommendation is that you gobble these up like tic tacs
okay i’m still trying to work this out how did penny meet an astronaut
i don’t know the regular way people meet astronauts
most of those guys live in texas
leonard lives here priya’s from india people meet howard god
you’ve met lots of astronauts and i’ve never grilled you about that i’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy
i’m not grilling you i was just curious
i still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part not that i care what my exgirlfriend’s up to ’cause i don’t
maybe that’s where she met the astronaut all right
i’m sorry what would an astronaut be doing working on a movie
i thought the movie was about 18thcentury vienna
he can’t have a hobby excuse me i have to pee or is that implausible as well
it’s nice to have another couple to hang with isn’t it
all right guys you have to go back i can’t afford you “no don’t send
good golly penny your whimsy is boundless phone rings what do you got for me wildebeest
i think they’re on to me the story’s starting to fall apart
calm down everything’s going to be okay to penny we may have to kill her bernadette i’m putting you on speakerphone where are you now
oh look at this another one of our classic bathroom gabfests what’s the problem
they’re just asking me all sorts of questions i can’t answer
i suppose i could get them back to talking about leonard going to india to meet priya’s parents
they said something about going there this summer
i don’t know i was too busy covering my heinie on amy’s stupid astronaut story
you texted me penny’s dating an astronaut
i texted architect that’s amusing autocorrect must’ve changed it
all right look just forget about the astronaut
architect where would you have met an astronaut
look just find out what’s up with this trip to india
i don’t want to do this anymore
thank you for coming with me sheldon you’re a good friend
i’m glad you think so that’s what i strive to emulate
okay let’s see if this drug works
forgive me for staring but you’re very beautiful
thank you that’s a great accent where are you from
oh cool i’ve always wanted to go there
it’s a beautiful country you’d love it may i join you
my name is dr rajesh koothrappali and this is my friend dr sheldon cooper
oh there’s no need to interact with me i’m just here to observe
we’re scientists we observe everything here go buy yourself a scone
oh derived from the word angel appropriate
i’d like to buy a scone
they sound delicious but this money is earmarked for scones
oh just getting comfortable so how long have you lived in los angeles
sheldon i’m talking to someone you’re being rude i’ll bet you’re an actress if not you should be you have a very expressive face
wait where are you going we were doing so well she never even got to see my penis tada
nice to see that the gals are getting along
gals who are you fred flintstone
this trip to india sounds fun
yeah i think it will be
are you concerned your parents might not approve of leonard
well i wouldn’t worry about it it’s not like you guys are getting engaged right
oh god no we’re not there yet
not engaged very interesting i have to tinkle
you’ve been in there a lot tonight are you okay
yes are you writing a book
i’m not upset maybe you’re upset
i can’t do this anymore i’m a good girl i went to catholic school storms out
okay well it’s getting late this was terrific you win bernie
i think the word you’re looking for is befuddled
my catapult flings my bishop to howard’s queen’s gorilla two
nice okay rook to transporter pad and he comes out at leonard’s queen’s bishop
hang on when is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart
when it’s done charging or you land on the time machine obviously
oh oh beekeeper to king 12 i capture your pope and release the swarm checkmate on sheldon
i knew i should have given my pope the jet pack
hey do me a favour and take table seven
you mean the one with my one hundred and eighteenpound rockhard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye
nah i prefer to look at it as the one with my exboyfriend and his gorgeous successful and sophisticated girlfriend who makes me feel like a toothless okie
do you want me to spill hot soup on her
oh please you’re not that kind of person
i know but if she orders something lowfat i’ll totally give her the fullfat version
dear lord have you been drinking it
well that’s it then i’m dead
i’m sorry do i really need to connect the dots for you the backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home sweet home not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend
hey that’s my sister and my country you’re talking about leonard may have defiled one but i won’t have you talking smack about the other
yes i’d like a sevenday course of penicillin some uh syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting and a mint
he drank from leonard’s glass words they’ll be carving into my tombstone
to the bar to sterilize my mouth with alcohol gang way dead man walking
all right here you go two lemonades one iced tea and a root beer for priya
thank you hey have you and howard started planning your wedding yet
yeah we’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean
nothing soothes those prewedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning
what did your mother say when you told her you were getting married
he hasn’t told her yet he’s waiting for the right time
i was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy
howard you’ve got to tell your mother
hey have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here
uh that’s different first of all we’re not engaged and second indian parents are very protective of their children
right right whereas jewish mothers take a casual ladida approach to their sons
i gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit
fine thank you for asking i love you so much
ooh fire demon sheldon’s turning up the heat
check it howard pulls one out from under the bridge nice
oh yeah she’s got puddles in all the right places
could you please play the game without commenting on every card
i’m taking a stroll and i’m sporting wood
bernadette and my mother are having a gettoknowyou lunch at the old town deli
hope so of course if history is any indication my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl
you mean adolf and eva not yet one goose step at a time
ma i’m home where are you
too soon to say i’m not done yet
no i mean lunch today with bernadette
oh i had a pastrami sandwich she had eggplant lasagna like that’s what a person orders in a jewish deli
besides food did you get along did you talk
oh sure did you know she’s going to school to become a microbiologist
i bet she did and you didn’t listen
yeah that’s probably it so what do you think do you like her she’s great huh
she’s a lovely girl cute as a button
that’s good to hear ’cause i’ve got some news
i hope it’s good news because i’ve got nothing but disappointment in here
bernadette and i are getting married ma you too busy bearing down ma crashing sound from in bathroom oh my god ma ma ma stand back i’m gonna break the door down runs at door it doesn’t break down falls over son of a bitch ma help
haven’t seen you in a while how’s it going
oh other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system hunkydory penny laughs did i say something amusing
i don’t know maybe i have no idea what you said
so your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all
is there a station coming up where i can board your giggling train of thought
it’s not a big deal sheldon it’s just ever since leonard’s been dating raj’s sister i’ve had to keep my distance i don’t get to hear all your jibberjabber
what are you doing at work these days
oh i’m working on timedependent backgrounds in string theory specifically quantum field theory in ddimensional de sitter space
alright come on even you have to admit that’s jibberjabber
interesting do you know where the phrase jibberjabber comes from
oh my god you’re about to jibberjabber about jibberjabber
howard and his mother are at the hospital come on we gotta go
i don’t know i just got a text come on hurry
to a hospital full of sick people oh i don’t think so
okay well your friend and his mother are there we’re going
oh don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs
not all germs just the ones that will kill me it’s the same way i’m not afraid of all steak knives just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax
right fine i’ll tell howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own wellbeing than his
i would think he would know that
okay you know what you are unbelievable you buy all these superhero tshirts but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing you just hide in the laundry room
fine i’ll go just for the record my aunt ruth died in a hospital she went in to visit my uncle roger caught something and bit the dust a week later the two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel
so i knocked down the bathroom door picked up my poor unconscious mother carried her to the car and drove like a madman to the emergency room
no i did what any son would do
hang on a second you picked up your mother her own legs are barely able to do that
i was filled with adrenaline it happens to be how women lift cars off babies
yeah i’m saying it’d be easier to lift a car
what can i tell you after i found the courage to put her pants back on i was unstoppable
they’re running tests i don’t know it may have been a heart attack or heartattacklike event
a heartattacklike event is an event that’s like a heart attack
regardless coronary problems are eminently treatable what’s more likely going to kill howard’s mother are the antibioticresistant superbugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital
i’ll sit over there it looks cleaner
is there a history of heart disease in your family
my family is the history of heart disease there’s a cave painting in france of one of my ancestors doing this clutches chest
well maybe mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her
come on howard i’m going to be your wife you can share anything with me
you told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack
how else is she supposed to take it
what you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left i’ve been the whole world to my mother i mean she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t
well when you say it like that you make it sound creepy
howard’s mother had a heart attack because i have sex with him and she can’t
i’ll give you 1000 if you’ll drive me home
nice of you to come for howard
well he’s my friend it’s what you do laughs
i’m sorry did i miss something
it’s just so weird howard wolowitz is my friend you know once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and i broke his nose
that’s a little easier to believe than he’s your friend
you know my brother had a group of friends like this in india they dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the new delhi power rangers
you mean when he was little
not as little as you’d want him to be
you know this stuff is horrible you want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee
sure we’re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee you want anything
i’m fine that’s nice that they’re getting along
your girlfriend and your exgirlfriend are hanging out together oh yeah that can only be good for you
one of them broke up with you do you really want her telling the other one why
i don’t care i don’t have anything to hide
good good then you have nothing to worry about
no i do not you are a mean little man
you’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me but actually they loved me a great deal
bernie it’s not you she’s just set in her ways
how can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother
it’s the circle of life sweetie one day our son will marry someone and it will kill you
howard i have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home
what’s wrong with the bathroom here
pneumococcus streptococcus staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses
sheldon my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is griefstricken over putting her there i’m not taking you home
will you at least go with me to the restroom here so you can open the door and flush the urinal
this might be a good time to point out howard that friendship requires a certain give and take hold the door
it wasn’t a heart attack she’s awake she’s resting comfortably we’re still running a few tests
actually she said and i quote she’d like to see the little catholic girl first
jews have been asking that for centuries there’s no real good answer
don’t worry you’ll be fine let’s just hide mr cross if it touches her it burns
you brought a catholic girl home to your mother
why don’t i write you a prescription for xanax
finally goes down corridor dodges into a door to avoid a coughing patient on a trolley the room is full of doctors in hazmat suits oh what fresh hell is this
wait you can’t leave here you’ve been exposed
no i haven’t it’s all good
you want to talk about crazy mothers leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up
it makes him desperate to please women that’s why the foreplay goes on and on
it’s like he’s trying to win a prize a word of advice don’t doze off you will never hear the end of it
there are a couple of things i did with penny that might be a little silly but…
every once in a while before we’d go to bed i’d put on a little show for her
what do you mean a show
well you know the way i took my clothes off
i’d look pretty stupid if there was no music
i wasn’t swinging around a pole
there was one time i put body glitter on
well i don’t think you have to worry about penny telling my sister that
your big problem is me telling her
you really are a mean little man
hey what took you guys so long
we were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack
it doesn’t matter i’m the king of foreplay
you’re a putz you know what that means
your mother just taught it to me she thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure i was okay
no because i’m engaged to a putz you let me believe i was the reason she had a heart attack
well based on the available evid…
shut up she said i’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me
to the toilet is that okay with you
is it just me or does she sound sexy when she’s angry
he takes the elf from off the shelf
hell hounds who let the satanic dogs out who whowho
i got a colossal serpent right here
sorry i’m just trying to cheer my buddy up rotting zombie sheldon’s new facebook photo
zandor wizard of the north ha i win
if you skip the part about being under a twoweek quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease absolutely
hey you guys ready to order
uh i’ll have the shepherd’s pie you want to split that with me
oh no no no he doesn’t
well you have milk in the taters milk in the gravy parmesan crust your lactoseintolerant boyfriend will turn into a gasfilled macy’s day balloon
not quite accurate the macy’s balloons are filled with helium whereas leonard produces copious amounts of methane
so no on the shepherd’s pie can we move on
sea bass i’ll have the sea bass
you gotta like this the girlfriend and the exgirlfriend bonding over your rootytooty stinky booty
it wouldn’help the human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death
guys sorry i’m late i have amazing news
bernadette before you change the subject does anyone have any final comments on leonard’s faulty digestive system
the thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation i’m getting my phd
wow so that means you’re a doctor you’re a doctor you’re a doctor you’re a doctor and howard you know a lot of doctors
so howard tell us how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married you’ll be referred to as mr and dr wolowitz
unless he takes bernadette’s last name and considering her advanced status that could open some doors for him
please this isn’t about me i’m proud of you
well you’ll be really be proud of this i was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company they’re gonna pay me a buttload of money
bernadette that’s great howard do you make a buttload
better than what you’ve got a buttload of
hey if i roll down the windows in the car everything’s peachy if you do it you’re still not a doctor
yeah just a headsup on the car window deal it helps but everything is not peachy
oh if there was a problem you can’t solve it check out the hook while my dj revolves it ice ice baby ice ice baby removes headphones and goes to refrigerator
oh god i feel ridiculous in this dress
you look beautiful lieutenant uhura now prepare for inspection
shh my brother’s going to hear you
relax he’s got headphones on and we’re ten miles above earth in a starship
really ten miles you’re orbiting inside the atmosphere moron
i can’t believe i’m wearing my brother’s halloween costume
i can’t believe you think he only wears it on halloween open the landing bay doors shuttle craft approaching
is that my future daughterinlaw the doctor
like leonard and the skinny weirdo
sheldon yes everybody’s a doctor but me
leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress can i stay here tonight
sure but i’m going out with bernadette it’ll just be you and my mother
of course he and i can play doctor
i don’t know she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormonereplacement therapy
i must say amy i was very impressed to see that bernadette got her phd
it’s indeed admirable although it is microbiology
your doctorate is in neurobiology i fail to see the distinction
i’ll make it simple for you i study the brain the organ responsible for beethoven’s fifth symphony bernadette studies yeast the organism responsible for michelob lite is there something wrong with your neck
it’s a little stiff what a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload not unlike balancing a faberge egg on a pixie stick
i’d like to respond to that sarcastically yes i relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it
i was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands
still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching
trust me with your right hand locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process
now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade making a small rotation as you do so
you should feel a small nodelike object rolling back and forth along the bone
obviously now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well
oh dear lord yes yes oh yes amy i’ve never been touched like this before oh oh my hands are magic
don’t flatter yourself your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system i could just as easily have paralyzed you
leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate star trek sex with my sister
i can see how that would be upsetting come in i’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch
oh don’t bother i’ll just sleep in leonard’s room
well he’s in my bed why can’t i be in his
the hammurabic code is an eye for an eye not a bed for a bed
come on dude i’m exhausted and tyra banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep
all right this is a form indemnifying me from your use of leonard’s bedroom sign here indicating that i tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression
wait not yet we still have to go over safety procedures now the apartment has three emergency exits located here here and here in the event of a power outage luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit
well i would’ve slept in my own bed but it was being used to bring shame to my family and the memory of gene roddenberry
sorry does sheldon know you’re sleeping in here
are you kidding he made me sign a waiver participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in cpr thank god he had a dummy
oh yeah mouthtomouth mona you know she used to date howard
oh my god she’s that mona why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here
we tried she doesn’t get along with sheldon
sheldon doesn’t get along with sheldon it’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night
okay well how about this until priya gets her own place you stay here and i’ll stay at your apartment
you sure bring as many as you want
do you really think you should be eating that cake
if you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife you might want to watch your waistline
he’s right a minute on the lips a lifetime on the hips
yeah haha first of all i’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success i’m proud of her and secondly i have my own career
good news raj i got the blood work back from the lab you’re okay to stay for a while
when did you take my blood
not important your sugar was a little high i’d follow up with your regular physician in the meantime i have some paperwork here for you to go over
boilerplate stuff a modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest and a living will and durable power of attorney
this says you can make end of life decisions for me
as your friend let’s hope it doesn’t come to that please sign
there’s a reciprocity clause you get to pull the plug on him too
congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard here’s your id card your key and your lapel pin which leonard was too cool to wear fyi part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work the comic book store the barbershop and the park for one hour every other sunday for fresh air
bring a ball or a frisbee you know something he can chase
also you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners tonight is thai food you’ll find the standard order in appendix b or downloadable from my ftp server if you have any questions here’s the faq sheet or if you prefer the human touch i do a live web chat called apartment talk on tuesday nights
this is the difference between eating and dining
remarkable i’m just realizing how much leonard’s been skating by all these years
it’s not a big thing just think of me as a brown martha stewart
hey sheldon did you change your wifi password again
yes it’s “penny get your own wifi” no spaces
thanks wow what’s with the fancy spread
my new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me pointing to lapel badge uh nice touch by the way
what do you mean new roommate what happened to leonard
the same thing that happened to homo erectus he was replaced by a superior species
i’m the new homo in town that came out wrong
all right let me try this again where’s leonard
he’s living at my place so i’m living here
you’re living here provisionally but i must say it’s looking good
woah leonard and priya are living together that’s big
no origami napkin swans that’s the headline
so do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company
well there are a couple of opportunities available but i volunteered for the premature ejaculation project i mean it’s not like either one of us has heart disease oh i almost forgot i got you a little present
oh bernie no you didn’t have to
i wanted to come on open it
you bought me a rolex how much did this cost
oh you let me worry about the money i just want my baby to have pretty things
oh no no no i’ve had way too much already
here’s an interesting fact about alcohol
man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated can you guess what the other is hint sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks
when does a monkey have a trunk
when a suitcase just won’t do
mmm all right it would appear as if alcohol is playing keepaway with your intelligence good night please note it is now past ten pm per our roommate agreement kindly refrain from raucous laughter clinking of glasses and celebratory gunfire
okay explain something to me you watch leonard put up with that guy for years and years what has to break inside your brain for you to think oh krishna i’ve got to get me some of that
well it’s a lot better than having to wear noisecancelling headphones in my own apartment
what oh god yeah yeah leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack
really even during allergy season when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing
it’s my sister can we not talk about this any more
yeah sorry sorry can i tell you a secret
i screwed up leonard’s a great guy never should have broken up with him
well uh to paraphrase shakespeare it’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography
nothing nothing you know if we weren’t friends and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story i’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy
hey you totally got that right e equals m c squared
i listen i have no idea what it means but i listen to friendship
would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking and the answer was elephant
leonard sweetheart we’re kissing not eating hot soup
that’s my parents on video chat go hide in the bedroom
oh come on why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating
oh we’ve been through this it’s not the time
i’ve got five brothers and sisters one of them is bound to screw up real big and then i’ll tell my parents about you now shoo
we heard there was a tornado in kansas city is that close to you
i don’t like it a young girl alone in an apartment
i’ll sleep so much better when you move back here next month
oh my god there’s someone in your apartment call the police in america
when were you going to tell me about this
oh hello leonard what a pleasant surprise mummy daddy you remember rajesh’s friend leonard
i thought you said rajesh was out with his friends
why are you lying to us
she’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating
well what difference does it make if you’re moving back to india we’re obviously breaking up
you know what i don’t want to deal with this right now
of course it is it always is it’s india now what do you have to say for yourself
uh that is a beautiful tapestry
oh god oh god oh okay look this never happened do you understand me raj nods really still can’t talk to me
i said what are you doing here
i have paperwork that says differently
irrelevant rajesh and i have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it knock on door what are you doing here
i’ve been up all night i had a fight with bernadette
she gave me a beautiful watch
oh it’s it’s not what it looks like
it’s not what it looks like it’s not what it looks like
penny’s brain teaser this morning she and koothrappali emerge from your bedroom she is dishevelled and raj is dressed only in a sheet the sole clue it’s not what it looks like
if i could i would but i can’t so i shan’t now knowing penny the obvious answer is they engaged in coitus but since that’s what it looked like we can rule that out let’s put on our thinking cap shall we mimes doing so raj is from india a tropical country third world hygiene parasitic infections are common such as pinworms mmhmm the procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air leonard spits out food yes just like that penny could have been inspecting raj’s anal region for parasites oh boy that’s a true blue friend
no you weren’t listening she said it’s not what it looks like
oh well don’t i look silly sitting here wearing this
hey leonard is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head
that sounds like sarcasm but i’m going to disregard it because i have an agenda paintball specifically the interdepartmental tournament this weekend now in order to function better as a fighting unit i thought we should establish a chain of command now it goes without saying that i would outrank the three of you but the question remains by how much now i don’t see me as some fourstar general back at hq riding a desk and playing golf with the secretary of defence but i also can’t be sergeant cooper because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular joe this might take some thought as you were
what the hell is wrong with you
yeah how could you do that
yeah right you’re just jealous because it turns out i’m penny’s number two choice after leonard
hey if i wasn’t engaged to bernadette that totally could have been me
please sheldon would have been before you and he might not even have genitals
why do you care so much you’re dating my sister and penny and i are in love
gentlemen if i may interject i’ve decided my rank will be captain if it’s good enough for kirk crunch and kangaroo it’s good enough for me
you’re not in love with penny
yes i am the god kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love
he’s the hindu version of cupid but way better because he rides a giant parrot
raj come on you fall in love with any girl who smiles at you a month ago you were writing poems about his fiancee
oh bernadette please play my clarinet
that could have been about anyone besides you have nothing to worry about because now i’m the dusky half of koothrapenny
for the record i do have genitals they’re functional and aesthetically pleasing
coming yup that’s good wine glasses should have handles
keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few
well i heard who you did
oh my god i screwed up everything i hurt leonard i hurt raj i mean what is wrong with me i feel like two totally different people dr jekyll and mrs whore
don’t be so hard on yourself do you know the story of catherine the great
she ruled russia in the late seventeen hundreds and one night when she was feeling particularly randy she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse
i’m… i’m sorry what does this have to do with me
she engaged in interspecies hankypanky and people still call her great i’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little indian boy
you jerk face what did you tell howard did you say there was something going on between us because he thinks there is he’s completely freaking out
what the hell is wrong with you
well you were always so nice to me i thought maybe you liked me
damn right you’re sorry and you tell howard there’s never been anything between us
do you think i have a shot with penny
of course you do you’re a cutie pie any girl would be lucky to have you
you know i’ve done this before in kindergarten i was supposed to marry jason sorensen at recess but by the time my class got out there he was already engaged to chelsea himmelfarb so what did i do hung upside down from the monkey bars let all the boys see my underpants
you can’t blame yourself when your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine we neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex
you know what let’s get out of here
somewhere where no one’s seen me naked we may have to drive awhile opens door sees leonard and sheldon slams it shut again
subtlety isn’t her strong suit is it
can i stay at your place for a few nights
really a best friend sleepover yay
we’ll make popcorn stay up all night and i’ll teach you my secret language op
nope sounds gop rop e a top
yeah i’m gonna go pack a bag
no you’re not you’re gonna pop a cop kop a bop a gop
do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball
who said that leonard i can hear your voice but i can’t see you
i’m not in the mood sheldon
oh there you are leonard i know you’re upset about recent events and i have someone here to help showing laptop screen
i don’t want to talk to amy
oh leonard is it really necessary to caption the obvious
he’s been like that since he was a toddler look mommy a butterfly maddening
what’s going on what do you want
sheldon informed me that you’re experiencing an emotional upheaval and i’m here to help
and we’re back to the obvious now what’s up
well uh okay um i don’t want to get back together with penny we tried it it was crazy it didn’t work but i can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend raj and then i find out that raj’s sister priya who i’ve been going out with for eight months is moving back to india so i’m just completely confused and alone
excuse me you’re a worldrenowned expert in parenting and child development and all you’ve got is buck up
thanks mother i feel much better
if you need any more help from me my books are available on amazon logging off
ninetynine one hundred it’s like a waterfall of liquid gold my turn
you know i don’t even know what the point of me staying in la is i haven’t gotten a single acting job since i moved out here the closest i came was last month i got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial
oh i could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids
i know right maybe i should just move back to nebraska
no i can’t let you do that
why not there is a knock on the door
for the first time ever i have a thriving social life and no pressure but it kind of lives and dies with you
hi amy can i talk to penny
a guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door i wish i could tell 13yearold me it does get better
how did you know i was here
it’s all over her facebook page
i’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer
no problem try and keep it in your pants okay
i was wondering if you’re free friday they’re having a totally ’80s night at the greek hall  oates katrina and the waves and threefifths of kajagoogoo
oh gee that’s really sweet but the thing is…
look honey i was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night we should’ve never slept together it’s what ruins friendships
you can’t ruin a friendship with sex that’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles
come here just listen to me i want to go back to the way we were before you know friends no sprinkles
well uh as your friend you might like to know that um we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense
oh god did you pull some weird indian crap on me
no no after we got undressed and jumped in bed you you asked if i had protection
of course i’m always packing anyway um i had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and that was all she wrote
penny please please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this
of course i won’t no i won’t
oh good um can i tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly kind of a candle in the wind deal
cool can i say it fell apart because you were all i want to have your babies and i was like i’m too rock and roll to be tied down
can i say i ruined you for white men
okay raj wait thank you for being my friend she hugs him
all right this is a google earth view of the field of battle
give it a second to load whenever you’re ready att okay here we go this is us here to the south is professor loomis and the geology department according to their twitter feed they’re out of sunblock which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma that’s our edge all we have to do is move quickly over this ridge the rockworshipping pastyfaced bastards won’t know what hit them all right let’s move out
hang on sheldon how could you not tell me your sister was moving back to india
maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee
screw you that was a beautifully written penis metaphor
you know what guys i’m not in the mood for paintball what do you say we just bag it
you can’t quit that’s a courtmartial offence that’s punishable by… you can’t quit
sorry sheldon it’s just not a good time for playing games
this is a game to you uh was the battle of antietam a game huh was the sack of rome a game
wait i just want you all to know that i forgive you this mutiny isn’t your fault it’s mine i haven’t earned these bars although what i lack in leadership apparently i more than make up for in sewing
let it go sheldon i’ll get you a jamba juice on the way home
no jamba juice is for heroes and that’s what we’re going to be
following in the footsteps of kirk crunch and kangaroo walks outside geology isn’t a real science gets hit by countless paintball pellets
if there’s ever a church of sheldon this will be when it started ow
i’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory captain sheldon cooper
excuse me it’s major sheldon cooper with my last breath i awarded myself a battlefield promotion it’s kind of a big deal
hi you guys have a minute
okay um well i already talked to raj but i wanted to apologize to the rest of you for you know everything
please penny let me we’ve decided to let our crazy wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower
hey what you doing quick draw
anyways i wanted you guys all to know that i’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion i have to stop kidding myself i suck at acting it’s time for me to move back to nebraska
what are you going to do in nebraska
i don’t know maybe teach acting phone rings oh sorry hold on hello
penny penny listen i hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me because i have a girlfriend and you’re a single woman
shh it’s my agent it’s my agent you’re kidding oh my gosh i can’t believe it really oh i’m so excited thank you thank you so much okay bye i got the haemorrhoid commercial i start monday
oh hell with nebraska i’m gonna be a star
have you ever thought of teaching physics
i don’t think so mom not today
oh sweetie haemorrhoids acting up again
you don’t know the half of it
oh yes i do try a dab of this
now the h is for her
oh uh priya’s calling in a few minutes on skype and we are gonna have a dinner date
it’s eight o’clock in the morning in mumbai how can she have dinner
fine whatever priya will be having breakfast
all right so technically it’s not a dinner date i suppose you could call it a uh dinfast date but if you did you’d open yourself to peerbased mocking such as hey leonard how was your dinfast with priya last night
you didn’t let me finish dinfast rolls eyes are those soybased candles
paraffin candles may contain carcinogens unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast dinfast rolls eyes
listen i don’t want to be rude but priya’s gonna be calling any minute so…
oh yes priya leonard you know i make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs
yes i’ve always admired that about you
as well you should but i’m going to make an exception here
priya has moved back to india to pursue her law career instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive you could use that time to take up a hobby
yes i read recently about a fellow in kansas with an enormous ball of twine i bet you could give him a run for his money
you know some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance they’d say things like love is stronger than the miles between you
when i rise to power those people will be sterilized
you videochat with amy all the time how is this different
well there’s the difference skype tone rings
i miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store
thanks for letting me stay here while leonard skypes with his girlfriend
oh it’s no problem it’s actually kind of nice you reading me reading we’re like an old married couple
if we were an old married couple the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles
i don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles
a good wife would go to the store
good on the way to see the lawyer pick up some tea and cookies i must say i am enjoying your new chair
it is aligns the lumbar cradles the coccyx balances the buttocks this is a chair worthy of the name
oh all right well i’m glad you like it i mean i still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away
yeah it was just sitting on the street i paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here
oh dear oh dear oh dear starts stripping off clothing
you take it easy i need to use your shower
i went into this marriage with so much hope
there’s a wet bandaid on the shower floor runs out of apartment
this is fun i’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before
pretty sweet huh this little baby set the university back 175 grand
that’s three minutes should we see what we got
oh yeah this is one goodlooking panini
thank you how’s it going with the longdistance love affair
not easy but we’re making it work
when you say making it work does that include doing the cyber nasty
you know the virtual pickle tickle the digital bowchickabowbow
come on dude this is my sister you’re talking about
hey leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it
there’s no junk jiggling we just talk
are you insane with highspeed internet you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth
well if you don’t you’re gonna lose priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with kama sutra coloring books
how can you be so racist
oh come on tell me i’m wrong
oh leonard good there you are i need you to check my head for chair lice
i did it last night i’m not doing it again
i don’t want to talk about it you didn’t catch bugs from penny’s chair
yes i did and now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the redwood national forest
sheldon you do this all the time you fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion
name one time i’ve ever done that
how about when you put gps trackers in your garbage because you were convinced north korean spies were stealing your doodles the chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets the strangelyshaped cloud that was following you around town the time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again
i said name one you really need to work on your listening skills
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
you need to remove that chair from the building it’s a health hazard
okay relax i took off the slipcovers had them drycleaned and then fumigated the cushions
yeah it’s cleaner than my couch found half a hot pocket in there
it certainly looks okay has a strong toxic chemical smell that’s reassuring
why don’t you give it a try sheldon
all right it is a comfortable chair
why don’t you just admit you overreacted
no thank you sees insect more appear and swarm all over him he jumps out of a daydream on his own couch jumps up and runs out to penny’s apartment
it’s like living with a chihuahua
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny

knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
for your safety please wait in my apartment as i call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death

knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
oh… you are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder

well that’s every song i know what’s up
you’re good friends with penny right
best friends besties bffs peas in a pod sisters who would share travelling pants go on
i was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture
for general educational purposes or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera
cholera is waterborne you’re mocking me
penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building
sheldon just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean i have to participate
kiss me where i’ve never been kissed before
you mean like salt lake city
never mind i’ll talk to penny
will you listen to me play my harp now
no i dislike the sound of the harp its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think i’m going to experience an episode from my past amy plays glissando i’m sorry mommy don’t be mad at me don’t do that
i don’t know about this howard
what you’re having trouble with the longdistance lovemaking this is your answer there are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth you have one priya has one in india when you move your lips and tongue on yours it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers see internet kissing howard kisses device give it a try
almost really get your tongue in there to activate the motion sensor
yeah you got it you got it
i’m impressed this is very lifelike
whoa you just bit my tongue
i i nibbled i was being playful
why do you have to make everything weird
pretty cool huh probably would cost like two hundred bucks in a store
i do appreciate a bargain this entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother
everything except bra and panties and they’re a leopardspotted secret i share with victoria
i just have one question about the chair
aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic
no it’s completely fine hmm i get it sheldon sent you he put you up to this
yes he did he absolutely did
my god amy that’s really crappy of you
yeah letting sheldon use you to manipulate me i thought you were my friend
no i am your friend please don’t be mad at me
i can’t even believe this you know maybe you should just go
no no i’m sorry i’m so sorry i take it all back look i’m uh i’m sitting in your chair there’s nothing wrong with it it’s a great chair please let me continue to be part of your world ow
something in the chair’s biting my tushy it’s not important ow
wait get up get up she does something is moving in the seat cushion they both run out of the apartment screaming swear you won’t tell sheldon what happened
i swear can i tell my doctor i’m probably gonna need shots
oh hey babe i think i figured this thing out
no you listen you’re my woman and i’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before
that’s right say my name and beg me for more ’cause i’m gonna give it to you
hello leonard if i may also say your name
yeah hey you know if this was in sheldon and leonard’s apartment i wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time
what kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this
penny a moment we just had thai food in that culture the last morsel is called the krengjai piece and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group
thank you all for this high honour
i’ve seen pictures of your mother keep eating
all right honey if we’re gonna make the movie we should go raj stands this may be hard for you to hear but when i say honey i mean my fiancée raj whispers to him yeah well now it means her
it’s okay if he wants to come
fine but next time we get a sitter
all right i got to go to work i’ll walk down with you
wait uh which is closer to the new train store in monrovia the movie theatre or the cheesecake factory
oh well then i guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me all right this fourletter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt
no penny don’t give up you can get this
no i have no interest in model trains stores that sell them nor their heartbreaking clientele
oh well i have some work to do so…
i can’t imagine that would disturb me carry on
okay wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home
all righty then guess i’ll just get started
leonard please i don’t need the running commentary
i was now i’m thinking about what i read you all right leonard you seem very uncomfortable
should i go i’ve been told sometimes i overstay my welcome
well you stay as long as you’d like
i’m glad to hear you say that because i’m having a wonderful time hmm i said the same thing to my gynaecologist
what are you going to get at the train store sheldon
oh i’m not buying anything they’re having a lecture ho gauge railroading half the size of ogauge but twice the fun very controversial topic
which side do you come down on
i’ll let you know after tonight unlike some people i’m going in with an open mind who am i kidding of course we all know it’s ogauge or no gauge
can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains
that’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house
first of all they’re not tricks they’re illusions and secondly when we get married they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes
why would i keep clothes at your mother’s house
well don’t think of it that way once we move in it’ll be our house
why would she move out it’s her house
hang on you seriously think i’m going to live with your mother
howard i think i can help here yes bernadette that’s exactly what he thinks
why not it’s a great house plenty of room and if we have kids mom’s there to help you know when she tells the three little pigs story she actually has hair on her chinnychinchin
i’m not gonna live with your mother not now not ever
wow someone obviously has some mommy issues
don’t listen to her go to the movie theatre
okay everybody calm down there is a simple solution here raj take me to the train store and then i don’t care what you people do
it was good good just out of curiosity what time do you usually go to bed
oh i’m up all night i’m like a possum boy you were not liked in high school were you
not really is that my yearbook
mmhmm dear leonard you’re really good at science maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork
well it wasn’t spraypainting a lightning bolt on my briefcase i can tell you that
if it makes you feel any better the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother
dear amy selfrespect and a hymen are better than friends and fun love mom
well you can add jerry’s junction to the list of train stores sheldon cooper will never set foot in again
you don’t know the half of it it was billed as a lively giveandtake on the merits of model train sizes but it was actually a setup to intimidate weakminded spineless rubes into buying ho starter sets
i don’t want to talk about it but it’s not a spinei’ll tell you that
well i had a delightful evening leonard we should do this again sometime
glad to hear it i need someone to accompany me to the wedding of dr moranelli and dr gustufson this friday they’re kind of the brad and angelina of the primatology department
i would but the last wedding we went to was a disaster he behaved like a child the entire time
not my fault you said there’d be other scientists there my age
doesn’t matter you’re out he’s in no date to the prom two dates to a wedding hmm how times change
haha you have to go to a wedding
hey i don’t want to fight i was just surprised when you sprung the whole livingwithyourmom stuff on me
yeah well i’m sorry i didn’t run it by you first
i don’t know who you’re talking to but in or out we don’t need bugs
the bugs only come here because you’re their queen listen how about this before we make any kind of decision about where we live we have a trial run stay here for a weekend see what it’s like
and your mom would be okay with that
sure she would ma do you mind if bernadette stays here this weekend
hey if she’s willing to give the milk away for free who am i to say no
frankly after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy a girl is a big relief
all this years i’ve been so wrong the tinier the train the more concentrated the fun
you’re a brain scientist can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains
not without cutting his head open no how about making my eyes like cleopatra
perhaps you’re right my cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them
aw so handsome like james bond
better than james bond because he’s tinier
i got you this to give to me
oh sweetie guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding that’s more of a prom thing
i never went to my prom my mom paid my cousin to take me but he just used the money to buy drugs
when you’re done copping a feel that goes on my wrist
all aboard woowoo it’s official i’m an ho trainiac
yeah yeah i guess does your mother always cut your meat for you
only when it’s fatty well don’t be jealous babe someday you’ll get to cut it for me
bernadette i found the extra head for the waterpik if you want to use it
you sure i just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth
hey ma how about a little privacy
oh i know what that means hubbahubba
let me know when you’re done canoodling mommy needs a foot rub
no thank you i’m really not much of a dancer
you’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist either
i’m sorry the bride and groom seem happy
why shouldn’t they be they have a feverish night of sociallyapproved copulation ahead of them in some cultures we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm
that sounds like a late night and i have work in the morning so…
leonard you may not have noticed but i am being a delight here and you’re not holding up your end of the evening
oh sorry this wedding just reminds me of my kindasorta girlfriend 9000 miles away
i have a kindasorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now you don’t hear me bitching about it leonard a word of advice moody selfobsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you
you have any evidence to support that statement
well hey i’m just as much fun as you are
really are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker i am
okay fine what do you suggest
we just had a lovely meal the band is on fire and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if i can sweat through these dress shields
once again i i’m really not much of a dancer
don’t worry i’ll lead they do the birdie song dance
no i need to brush my teeth but your mother’s been in the bathroom for like an hour
oh yeah she sometimes has problems doing her business hang on ma give up tonight’s not your night
you don’t know that i just sat down
come on take a break bernadette needs to brush her teeth
she can come in and brush her teeth i’m not embarrassed
no it’s not i’m not going in there
oh come on honey she’s just sitting in there reading a magazine you can’t see anything i go in all the time
and we have splashdown wait here i’m gonna go light a candle and then we make passionate love
i just can’t figure out what happened i put my left leg in i took my left leg out i put my left leg in and something just snapped
the hokey pokey is a young man’s game
i did have a great time thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while
and also for breaking the head off the ice swan so i could hold it against my pulled groin
i excel at spatial reasoning and i had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely
want to come in have a cup of tea
no thanks i’m gonna head home
good night heads across corridor and knocks on penny’s door
ames hi how was the wedding
great until i accidentally made leonard fall in love with me
come in let’s talk do you want a glass of wine
wine is one of the reasons i’m in this fix that and this dang pelvis
okay i’m sorry what exactly happened
the inevitable he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend while i was charming supportive and let’s face it in this dress the perfect combination of madonna and whore
oh god did he make a move on you
no but it’s only a matter of time how could i have not seen this coming now i’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart
yeah i’m sure he’ll be okay
oh penny much as i would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man leonard just doesn’t get my motor running
so um what are you gonna do do you want me to talk to leonard let him down easy
no i’ll let him have tonight then in the morning i’ll send him an email letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland i mean frankly you’ve got a better shot than he does
leonard check it out i bought an ngauge locomotive half the size of ho look it fits in my mouth
sounds like you had a great night
not bad i had a lot more fun with amy than i thought i would
what exactly do you mean by that
well it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time although truth be told my groin’s a little worse for wear sheldon hits him ow why did you do that
to send a message she is not for you
yes it is and you’re so pretty in the morning
your mom and i made you breakfast
oh wow so you guys are getting along
yeah i guess we’re very different people howard so communication’s a little tricky
if you want butter i’ll get you butter
well i guess i’ll cut these by myself
the entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door you manage to open it only to find yourself facetoface with a hideous foulsmelling mosscovered ogre what do you do
i say hey ma what’s for dinner”
seventeen the ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass by the by i liked it too
hey how go the wedding plans howard
great we spent five hours last night at macy’s registering for gifts looks like i’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish i’ve always wanted
see this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9000 miles away i can spend my nights doing whatever i want
you mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower
really so we’re playing dungeons and dragons and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon isn’t that a little on the nose
when you play chutes and ladders do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders
are you gonna eat that whole pie
maybe why not who do i have in my life to watch my figure for
oh god did you watch bridget jones again
no it’s just that everybody’s got someone sheldon’s with amy howard’s getting married you’re dating my sister
now that howard’s getting married maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you
you know who i blame for my loneliness the united states of america your movies and your tv shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas
eat another pie you’ll have your own bazongas
that’s cruel you know it goes straight to my hips
gentlemen please focus you’re facing a firebreathing dragon
i don’t know if i want to play anymore
because you don’t have a girlfriend well good lord if that becomes a reason not to play dungeons and dragons this game’s in serious trouble
now i assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions
yeah my bikini region is fine
who’s shocked i’m not so bernadette how’s the wedding planning going and i’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid pick me pick me
we went caketasting yesterday raj came along he cried and ate half the samples
oh the poor guy’s so lonely we should set him up with someone
you know i met a really cute girl at work she’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials
yeah but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group
okay so future griefstricken widow is the one to beat
one moment i’m conducting an experiment
yes from here on in i’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best enlighten and amaze page 14 item seven
a side of corn succotash hmm interesting
um howard can i see you for a minute please
uh i don’t want to show any more of your friends how i can fit in the booster seats
uh no that’s not it just come with me please
let’s see what i’ll be washing that succotash down with a pitcher of margaritas
that’s the great thing it doesn’t matter my mind is freed up to think about more important things
um raj there’s someone i want you to meet this is my friend emily i know her from my spin class raj relax she can’t hear you she’s deaf
emily this is our friend raj
oh look at you guys just hitting it off i am so good
she says it’s nice to meet you
does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically
raj says it’s nice to meet you too she says she has to go back to her family but penny has her number if you want to text her and get together
okay i’m going to play it cool tell her maybe whatever babe
ah look at that i have a date i love america again
and now for dessert come on hot fudge sundae come on hot fudge sundae bam that’s what i’m talking about
okay as soon as she gets here so she knows i’m cool with it i’m going to make a joke about her being deaf i was thinking hey did you hear the one about… oh no i bet you didn’t
maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan
no joke oh she says she’s sorry she’s late
tell her it doesn’t matter tell her her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens
really that’s the first thing you want to say
i worked on it all night use it
look i don’t know the sign for opalescent
i don’t know how to spell it
you’re making me sound like a caveman
she says thank you you have nice eyes too”
really ask her how many children she wants and whatever number she says say me too
fine tell her i have a deep sexy voice like james earl jones
she doesn’t know what james earl jones sounds like
great then she won’t know i’m lying
let’s see what else can i tell you about me that would make you like me ooh i love music do you love music
you really want to ask her that
she says do you play an instrument
no but when i was six years old i tried to start a boy band called frankie goes to bollywood but i couldn’t get any other boys to join so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers wait when you sign servants don’t sign it like i’m bragging sign it in a way that i sound humble with just a hint of that’s right i had servants
yes but she doesn’t so get signing hand monkey
i think i wrote a letter to santa claus every day and then on christmas morning under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon
texting bernadette that i’m gonna be late
it’s a funny story about a puppy just smile and laugh quick quick stop smiling
the puppy died it choked on a doll head sad face sad face
it’s a little hard to see with the city lights but that wshaped constellation is cassiopeia and she was the mother of andromeda who’s over there
look pretty stars this is her car she hopes she can see you again sometime
good good oh boy help me out here does she want me to kiss her or not
i speak sign language i don’t read minds
if you were me would you kiss her
yeah but i’m a make out king she kisses raj and gets into car
i was so smooth on that date
you i made you smooth you were an idiot
it might’ve been on your lips but it was my kiss
oh fine let’s agree she kissed both of us
mustache is looking good there sheldon
don’t thank me thank the dice they told me what percentage of my face to shave
why are you still doing this
because it’s working in the past few weeks unburdened by trivial decisions i’ve coauthored two papers in notable peerreviewed journals and i’m close to figuring out why the large hadron collider has yet to isolate the higgs boson particle
you left out got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants
the dice giveth and the dice taketh away
is raj out with emily again
yeah every night for the last month
wow can’t believe he has a girlfriend
here’s some other fun news on the rajemily front he gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car
you think she’s taking advantage of him
oh of course not she wouldn’t do something like that she’s deaf
deaf women can’t be gold diggers
handicapped people are nice leonard everyone knows that
yeah i actually have information about raj that would be helpful with this discussion
let’s see rolls dice snake eyes sorry bud
wait hang on doubles roll again
okay get this it doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts because the koothrappalis are vastly wealthy
what do you mean vastly wealthy
well wealthy means a lot of money and vastly means even more i’m not sure what’s tripping you up
look i know they have money i don’t think it’s that much
no you’re wrong see as you know a few years ago i achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public well from time to time i notarize banking documents for raj the koothrappalis aren’t just rich they’re richie rich rich
well so how much is that
about halfway between bruce wayne and scrooge mcduck
what the hell the last time we went to the zoo that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro
listen guys i’m sorry i don’t mean to be rude but i need to go call raj’s sister who i love so much so vastly much
okay so he’s got money and it’s a few gifts and a car
and she got him to pay off all her credit cards
what he paid off her credit cards damn it i could’ve dated raj for a couple months but i i wouldn’t have because i’m not that kind of girl we should really talk to raj
he’s not going to listen he’s in love
can’t figure out what to do i remember those days now if you’ll excuse me i have to… rolls dice stay right here
yeah this is a bad idea we should go
no i’m the one that introduced him to her i’ve got to say something
hey bernadette doesn’t mind where i get my motor running as long as i park in the right garage
i can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend oh here she comes
smart whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you
oh hey hi nice to see you
um can we talk to you about raj
she says sure what about him
okay um gosh how do i start um see raj is kind of naive i mean he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women and i’m concerned that without meaning to you might be taking advantage of him you know by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive thingsand i i… howard focus tell her what i’m saying
right are you a gold digger or not oh uh something something who the something do you think you are mind your own something business and go something yourself oh wait i got this now
how dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym
we didn’t mean for it to be an ambush just it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people and hey since when are you so chatty
raj come here this girl is trouble i mean what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex
the best one i ever had
okay come on you know you can do better
aha i see what’s going on here you and i had our crazy night together and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman
it’s okay i can’t get mad at your feelings
yeah that’s good keep telling yourself that storms out
he is cuter now that i know he’s rich
i have a surprise for you cover your eyes open them it’s a real ruby it was a little expensive but no one can put a price on love although the people at cartier took a pretty good shot at it skype tone from computer oh mummy daddy what a nice surprise
no it’s not a nice surprise it’s a bad surprise
she told us you’re spending all our money on your new girlfriend
i just got her a couple of things she gives me things too
yeah yeah i’m a gynaecologist i know exactly what she gives you
you need to find a nice indian girl from a good family if you keep seeing this woman you’re cut off
what you’re going to make me choose between the woman i love and the money i have very strong feelings for
hah you’re an idiot love doesn’t last well he’s going to find out eventually think about it
my parents are making me choose between money and you i choose you she signs no i think we’ll have to return the car again and that necklace yeah that too but none of those things matter because we have something better we have love
oh penny i hurt so bad
sometimes i put the tv on mute just to pretend she’s still with me but i can’t watch the closed captioning without crying
oh i’m so sorry i wish i could make you feel better
seriously i’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me
look penny you’re great but i had a long talk with my parents and they said if i date an indian girl i get a maserati
mmm oh cheesecake you’re just as good as a woman even though i can’t have sex with you
try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds
should i use the rest room or wait until we get home come on papa needs to void his bladder oh that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks
here you go boys i’ll pick it up when you’re ready
oh and don’t cheap out on the tip we all know you’re loaded now
it’s from game of thrones what do you think
i don’t know if we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection and i’ve long thought we should is this really the sword to start with
what did you have in mind
well off the top of my head i’d have to go with excalibur it gives you the right to rule england
it would be a replica of a movie prop
fair enough it’d give you the right to rule a replica of england
well they don’t have an excalibur here so what do you want to do
mm tough decision there’s no weaponry from lord of the rings forged in a chinese sweatshop
just bilbo baggins’ sword over there
two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger wouldn’t we look silly okay let’s go for it
oh i see you guys have found my little treasure
buhbuhbuhbuh what do you want for it
oh it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable but for my friends let’s say 250
well it’s a limited edition they only made 8000 of these bad boys
only 8000 we’re wasting precious time buy it
hang on can you do any better
are you kidding i’m already giving you the friends and family discount
oh did you hear that we’re getting the friends and family discount we are honoured and we will take it
what are you doing two fifty is already the discounted price
tell you what i’ll go two thirtyfive
okay two twenty five my final offer
two ten and i’m losing money
oh now we can’t let him lose money leonard i’m so sorry
two ten and you throw in the iron man helmet
are you crazy that helmet’s signed by robert downey jr
okay if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book then all of our lives have no meaning
okay fine just the sword two ten
thank you i can eat meat this week
see that i just saved us forty bucks
i’ve long said what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts
you want me to wrap it
no it’s okay i’m gonna stab my friend in the chest
it’s part of my sword collection do you have a sword collection
here’s the batman 612 with the jim lee alternate cover that you wanted
awesome what do i owe you
sucker didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount
hey i’m having a party at my house on friday and i was hoping you would stop by
there will be girls you guys are invited if you want to come by
i see what you’re doing you accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy he tells everyone we’re going to be there and when we don’t show he looks the fool fiendishly clever
i was actually thinking about going
and then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out leaving him humiliated in front of his guests love it
no i was gonna grab raj and howard and have a good time
oh great more guys it’s gonna be another wil wheaton sausagefest
sheldon can you grab me a water
at this moment our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states until you either do not go or go to wil wheaton’s party you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend i’m characterizing this phenomenon as schrodinger’s friendship
got it can i have my water
of course now get it yourself you traitor
in case you have forgotten schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…
no no no no i didn’t forget um there’s this cat in a box and until you open it it’s either dead or alive or both although back in nebraska our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there
homespun stories knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it you’re the whole package aren’t you
sorry i’m late uh i got great news nasa picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the international space station this spring
it gets better someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist and guess who that someone is
mohammed is the most common first name in the world lee the most common surname as i didn’t know the answer i thought that gave me a mathematical edge
it’s me sheldon it’s me i’m going up in space technically i’m an astronaut
hang on a second nasa doesn’t have a shuttle any more how are you going to get up there
oh well it’s really cool you fly to moscow they take you out to kazakhstan and then you get into a russian soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit or just sits there on the launch pad because the kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market
well i mean safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you chernobyl
i’d like to propose a toast the dream to go up into space is one we all share and howard’s making that a reality we’re all very proud of you
that was a lovely toast kudos
simultaneously a festival of cloying clichés you sicken me
you’re really quiet is everything okay
i hope not too tired because i’m feeling particularly masculine right now all systems go if you catch my drift
all right well something’s obviously bugging you what is it
i just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me
oh i get it you’re worried about me that is so sweet you know there’s a saying we have at nasa what makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home
this isn’t the reaction i expected when i told you i was gonna be an astronaut
what did you think was going to happen
do you realize what a big deal this is what an honour it is to be chosen to go into space
yeah i get it i just wish you included me in the decision we’re supposed to be partners we’re supposed to be a team
i’m sorry you’re right okay let’s try this again bernadette an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us and i’d like to discuss it
i’ve been offered a chance to go up to the international space station for three weeks what are your thoughts on that
well first of all thank you for including me in the decisionmaking process
hey we’re a team so what do you think
howard my father was a police officer we never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive it was horrible and i don’t want to live that way with you
hey my father abandoned me and my mother when i was 11 we never saw him again
oh boohoo you’re not going to space
don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us and yes it sure is buddy
for god’s sake will you stop with the schrodinger stuff
would you prefer a simpler application of heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in which i could either know where you are or whether i like you but not both
you never stop talking do you
i don’t understand what differences does it make if leonard goes to wil wheaton’s party
wil wheaton is sheldon’s mortal enemy
sheldon i know you’re a bit of a lefthanded monkey wrench but you really have a mortal enemy
in fact i have 61 of them would you like to see the list
oh say no say no say no say no
you just got off the list would you like back on it this’ll just take a moment it’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy
well i started the list when i was nine
how did wil wheaton get on the list
as a child i loved wesley crusher wil wheaton’s character on star trek so i drove for hours by bus to a star trek convention at which wil wheaton was scheduled to appear so that i could get my wesley crusher action figure signed but he never showed because apparently it was cooler for him to be the lowerleft corner on hollywood squares oh damn the floppy failed well whoever was in charge of quality control at the verbatim corporation in 1989 congratulations you just made the list
change your mind about sex i’m still mad but i’ll do it
no i’ve just been thinking it doesn’t matter if i’m afraid for your safety i don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams
really if going into space means that much to you i will never say another word about it
i love you too so sex now
okay i just forgot to brush my teeth i’ll be right back exits
over my dead body my son goes into outer space
wait let me see if i got this right you actually asked bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night
what choice did i have she went behind my back and turned my own mother against me
wow you’re not only our first astronaut you’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed you’re like a rock star
i hate to say it but she did kind of betray you
interesting you see betrayal in others but not yourself
going to wheaton’s party is not betraying you
oh of course you would have to believe that evil always thinks it’s doing right excuse me stormtrooper these are the droids you’re looking for
i’m going to a party i’m not turning r2d2 and c3po over to the empire
so what’s gonna happen next are you and bernadette going to break up
i don’t know if we’re going to get back together she’s going to have to apologize and accept that i’m a grown man who can make his own decisions
then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space
i had no choice i had to tell his mother he can’t go to space he’s like a baby bird do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book
no i was there that day sheldon threw his back out handing him that book
i don’t know what i’m going to do i don’t want to break up over this
okay why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake
do you guys think it was a mistake am i the bad guy in this
it’s not for us to judge we’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done
oh god you’re right i took our love and threw it under his bussized mother i need to apologize
well that that’s good i’m glad you came to that but before you do let me just ask you a big picture question
are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry howard wolowitz
i do with all my heart
got it just had to check
all right sheldon we’re going to wil’s this is your last chance
no leonard this is your last chance one day a historian is going to come to you and say is it true you were friends with dr sheldon cooper and you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble i was but i chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from stand by me that no one remembers
oh good you picked me you picked me
no i just got a text from stuart brent spiner is at the party
really brent spiner mr data himself you love him
i did but i think i’ve kind of outgrown star trek you know stock characters ludicrous plots beam me up what a load of hooey
i’m going live long and prosper sheldon
yeah even that you look like a dork
what kind of a schmuck play is that she can hear you shouting
you can i have nothing to say
all right i just wanted to tell you i’m sorry i said something to your mother
i was gonna tell her eventually but you went behind my back
i know i’m sorry i got scared
if you’re gonna love me you’re gonna have to love the whole package the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil
well don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it ’cause i’m not just gonna stop with the space station yeah i want to go to the moon i want to go to mars i want to take a oneman sub to the lowest depths of the ocean
really you got seasick on pirates of the caribbean
well those big kids were rocking it
i just did what i did because i love you so much and the thought of losing you is more than i can handle
you’re my soul mate this is where you kiss me
make up all you want your tuchus is not leaving this planet
hey you know that beautiful actress who plays the borg queen in first contact
well i just met her gynaecologist
fighting for our friendship as peculiar and annoying as you can be you’re still my little buddy i’m not going to let that end here tonight now put down that drink let’s meet brent spiner and go home
hey sheldon i’m so glad you made it i found something i think you might like
what i’d like is for him to have a more depressing home this is quite lovely
an original mintinpackage wesley crusher action figure
i remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed and i didn’t show up
to sheldon sorry this took so long your friend wil wheaton
it’s my last one i want you to have it
look everyone wil wheaton is my friend
brent spiner what have you done that was an original mintinpackage wesley crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend wil wheaton
sorry slim i’ve got some mr data dolls in the trunk of my car you want me to sign one for you
you’ve already signed something brent spiner your name on my list from this moment on you are my mortal enemy
don’t worry it doesn’t take up a whole lot of your time
come on buddy let’s not waste another second on this loser love your house
two for thirty and you come to my birthday party
so what kind of cruise is this you’re going on
it’s called the born again boat ride christian quarterly gave it their highest rating five thorny crowns i do wish you’d come with me sheldon
well mom if i did it would be conclusive proof that your god can work miracles
you’re missing out it’s gonna be walltowall fun it’s all themed there’s jonah and the whale watching allyoucaneat last supper buffet and my personal favourite gunning with god
what’s gunning with god i’m afraid to ask
oh it is a hoot and a half you write your sins on a clay pigeon they fire ’em up in the air and you pulverize them with a 12gauge shotgun full of our lord’s forgiveness
frankly mom i’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge
for example if shelly was aboard he’d write “smart mouth” on his pigeon and then bam
the lord giveth and the lord bloweth away well mom according to my itinerary for our weekend together the fun begins with fried chicken
good ’cause i got you everything you need to make it you are in for a treat my mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin
sheldon she just got off the plane she doesn’t want to cook
of course she does making me food is her way of saying i love you making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying i really love you
actually i wouldn’t mind going out for a bite sheldon
won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me
all right that settles it we’re going out do you like sushi there’s a great little place down the street
i’ve never had it but there’s no harm in trying something new
there’s a lot of harm in trying something new that’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits
sheldon you’re talking like a crazy person
actually i had him tested as a child doctor says he’s fine
although i do regret not following up with that specialist in houston
stop yelling i’m not happy about this
what’s the last thing you were ever happy about
this is exciting back home the diner on route four serves sushi but it’s just cut up fish sticks and a side of uncle ben’s they put it on the menu in those kung fu letters but that don’t make it sushi
uh kung fu letters might not be politically correct
oh i thought the one we couldn’t say was ching chong
so shelly what’s up with you and your friend amy if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit
well there’s actually big news on the amy front she’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals she is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine
do you have any idea what’s going on with those two
it’s kind of like the loch ness monster maybe there’s something there maybe there isn’t we’ll probably never know but sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it
how are you doing on the young lady front i hear you’re in some sort of a long distance situation
uh yeah it’s raj’s sister it’s kind of tough she’s in india also her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white
oh that’s a funny turn isn’t it you never think about it going the other way well you can’t force things you need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re just calling it one it’s like they say a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don’t make ’em biscuits
and that reminds me of another saying you can lead a chicken to crisco but you can’tmake your mother fry it
sheldon you pester me one more time about chicken i will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant
please pester her please for me
so mrs cooper what did you think of the sushi
it was good the only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef sheldon when is your landlord going to fix the elevator
i don’t know lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo
your son seems to think we need to launch a preemptive strike on burbank
get them before they get us
hey look who decided to show up
i couldn’t find you guys so i bought six new friends three sadly are dead
mom you remember rajesh rajesh my mother
of course mrs cooper so nice to see you again
well it’s so nice to see you too i thought it was our indians that had the occasional alcohol problem
we don’t say that either i’ll make you a list
oh that would be mighty white of you so raj what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol
that’s better now tell me what’s bothering you
oh yes born alone die alone it’s a tragic human condition now raj if you’ll excuse my mother she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good i’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken
sheldon your friend is hurtin’ what do we do when someone’s hurtin’
and when they’re drunk as a skunk what beverage do we offer
and what do we do it with sheldon fixes a large false smile now you listen to me i know you feel like you can’t find someone but there’s a lock for every key back home there’s a girl works at the walmart tall tall girl woman could hunt geese with a rake thought she’d never find a man then one day wouldn’t ya know harlem globetrotters come to town long story short today that woman travels the world with a semiprofessional basketball player and two beautiful mixedrace babies
i didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent but the general tone was soothing and somehow i feel better
i’m not going to get my pecan pie am i
nice kick a man when he’s down
i’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together just the two of us
sure one thing you really miss when you’re on vacation is laundry
careful you’re using too much downey you know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy
well this takes me back me doing your laundry you next to me criticizing
sheldon you didn’t tell me your mom was coming
it was in my weekly email blast right between beet season is finally here and uhoh red stool from beets leads to cancer scare
i hear that leonard has a new girlfriend how are you doing with all that
oh fine you know it’s been a while i’m getting back out there
let me ask you when you get back out there are you wearing this holds up a skimpy top
well it’s super cute on that top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost
yes penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures
hon you think maybe the reason why you’re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you’re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket
oh they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster sometimes they only get to spin the teacups now i’m going out tonight would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit i’m going to wear
oh not crazy at all and don’t beat yourself up when i was your age you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine
now that will not be in this week’s email blast
so this spring i get to go to the international space station
oh my word a trip to the heavens if you ever want to live there eternally i’ve got a good book you could read
thanks but i watch the charlie brown christmas special every year so i get the gist
i bet your mom is really proud of you
nope she says if i don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike it would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger but still
i’ve got a treat for us tomorrow mom i’m taking you to see saul perlmutter give a lecture about his nobel prizewinning work in cosmology and the best part is at the q and a afterward i’ve worked up a couple of q’s that will stump his sorry a
i don’t know shelly i thought we could do a little sightseeing
what sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a nobel laureate
come on sheldon we’ll take your mom to see the hollywood sign the wax museum the walk of fame
ooh maybe a little rodeo drive
well i can’t spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag but it’s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation
what do i say i say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi and your sadness and your slutty shirts stop it
he’s not talking about your shirt your shirt is fine
the trick to pancakes is bacon grease i cook everything in it
everything aren’t you worried about your health
oh doctors are always changing their mind one week bacon grease is bad for you the next week we’re not getting enough of it good morning shelly
mom i want to apologize for my behaviour last night
great now you’re going to love the perlmutter lecture look he will be stating that the universe is older than 6000 years but i thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum amazing grace during those parts
i am still going out with your friends
but i apologized and that was hard for me because i didn’t do anything wrong
shelly i hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up i want to go sightseeing so why don’t you have some pancakes get dressed and come with us
i’m not going and you can’t make me
you’re right i can’t have a nice day
well i’m going to stand here until you change your mind
well then you are going to stand there all day
i’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there
i can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me
i am not abandoning you sheldon abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep i am going to hollywood and thank a wax ronald reagan for his service to our country
we appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship mother
all right mom when you’re at the ripley’s believe it or not museum if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son believe it because it’s true grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from leonard’s hand
that lecture was a waste of time i made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper sneezes
no i’m just allergic to people who get nobel prizes for no good reason
sheldon is it possible that your foul mood or to use the clinical term bitchiness is because your mother isn’t making you a priority
no or to use the clinical term nuhuh
are you sure the infantmother pairbond is the building block of primate psychology
oh there it is it always comes back to monkeys with you just monkeys monkeys monkeys
sheldon we’re all animals and granted there are aspects of you that are extraordinary but when it comes to emotions and relationships you’re just like everybody else
are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person
actually some research indicates that by not overthinking the less intelligent handle emotions better he sneezes again sure you’re not coming down with a cold
oh yes the common cold just like everyone else you’d love that wouldn’t you
oh this one’s sweet you know for your rosary rattlers
mrs cooper we say catholics not rosary rattlers
my goodness it’s a wonder you people in california can talk at all
this is like the worst hollywood tour ever
what are you gonna do she wanted to see churches
hey they have wine here don’t they
hey none of our gods have abs like that
yep that’s the last jew who did situps and look where it got him
hey while we’re here why don’t we all do some praying let’s put a little church in this church
oh i’m not sure we should
it’s easy i’ll show you how lord mary cooper here coming to you from gomorrah california i want to thank you for the blessing that is my little shelly i also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my bible all right penny your turn
okay um hey god what’s up um i’m good but uh it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth but no cops be cool
she also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour could probably use that chat you had with mary magdalene leonard you’re up wasserman you’re on deck
okay i don’t know it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller oh um if you could help out with me and my girlfriend she’s all the way in india that would be great
hear that girl trouble turns out we were both wrong on that front how about you
oh me no thanks i’m good i’m really just trying not to burst into flames
he says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds
huh i might have gone with the talkingtogirls thing
no you only get one wish
look at the two of us me a highly regarded physicist the kind of mind that comes along once maybe twice in a generation you the common man tired from your labours as a stockbroker or vacuum cleaner salesman or bootblack but deep down inside apparently we’re just two peas in a pod a regular pea and the kind of pea that comes along once maybe twice in a generation rain another great equalizer falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike the stranger puts up an umbrella smartypants
oh mrs cooper it smells so good
you take notes darlin’ the real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup he’ll die at 50 but his love will be true
i need a tissuethis one got wet
thank you yeah i’ve learned something today you and i in so many ways other than intelligence and what counts we’re the same sneezes
i hope so because if this is well life isn’t worth living
oh sugarpie you are burning up we’ve got to get you to bed
don’t worry mama’s here to take care of her baby
and just to be clear only her baby and not these other people
can i have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off
you can have whatever you want
boy last time i put vaporub on you you didn’t have hair on your chest
i know it filled in last year i didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit
shelly you’re not eight years old any more we have to have a different relationship
no we don’t the one we have works great
sweetheart you are a grown man
or maybe i’m part of a new species that lives for hundreds of years which means i’m still basically a toddler
oh i so should have taken you to houston
does this mean you’re not going to sing soft kitty
no i will always sing you soft kitty sings soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur…
mrs cooper were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven
well i know but he means well sing
what are you trying to pull mom from the top
this is what i’m talking about sings soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur…
and reverse the spin on the antiproton and gamma becomes alpha multiplied by a matrix of negative i comma zero and there we have it conclusive proof that i am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock
hmm looks outside office door corridor lamp sparks and goes out corridor is bathed in an eerie glow all right all right i see what’s going on a little prehalloween hijinkery a ghostly moan a rattling of chains a witch’s cackle the trifecta of haunted house clichés instead of eek i say yawn
oh the walls are dripping blood which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution reading message on wall see you in hell sheldon the most frightening thing about that is the missing comma a luminous skeleton rushes towards him ah okay all right that one was clever skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line come on out merry pranksters take a bow
yes there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled
come on admit it we got you sheldon
please fright depends on an element of surprise the simple fact is because i am much smarter than you and able to anticipate your actions it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me leonard creeps out behind him wearing a star trek balok mask
we can’t beat him he’s just too smart
gentlemen turns and sees leonard screams and faints
hang on looks like everyone’s a winner
oh watch out sheldon this little boy casper is a gggghost
not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine
that was pretty droll with a hint of ammonia
yes enjoy your japes gentlemen you think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic well you’ve forgotten one thing i am also a son of the lone star state i’m texas through and through and we know how to settle scores down there if you doubt me ask mexico
hot girl nine o’clock don’t everybody look at once
what is she doing in a comic book store
i don’t know she might be lost doesn’t matter watch and learn hi
um… ititit… returns to guys shut up

uh yeah it’s issue number 21 first appearance of hellboy
i know i’ve been looking for it for years
hey if i pretended to hit on you could i distract you enough to sneak it away
yes but you’d be using your superpowers for evil
damn i’m forbidden by my kryptonian father to do so i am alice
thanks you too you know go ahead and take it
no no no no i i i did evil would you be open to a trade
uh yeah yeah sure i guess
okay here this is my number call me
sorry palm’s a little sweaty what’s that word
oh right your name that makes more sense than penis
did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store
‘cause if you did you get your picture up there on the wall of heroes
no i don’t think i picked her up besides i have a girlfriend
doesn’t matter this is the closest anyone’s ever come you’re going on the wall my friend
be sure to check the mail
how many times are you gonna tell me what’s with you
nothing it’s not suspicious that i’m fixating it’s consistent with my personality
more halloween candy didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday
oh yeah that’s gone it’s a rough month when halloween and pms hit at the same time
leonard doesn’t have time to chat he has to get the mail
will you relax i’ll get it in a minute hey how was work
excuse me sheldon holds fingers in ears a couple of circulars nothing important
hang on sheldon opens mail box a loud horn blows and a balloon with leonard’s face on pops out sheldon faints again you might be from texas but i’m from new jersey
check it out jim lee drew this of me two years ago at comic con
well you know it’s comic con i’m liono from thundercats
wow you must have gotten so laid
no but jessica alba did rub my furry belly
want to see a comic i draw
you’re kidding you have your own book
yeah it’s kinda based on my life
cool oh look that’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a chewbacca costume comic con
you’re very talented this is really good did you do… she kisses him
so can i trade you my comic for the hellboy
oh dear reaches into box picks up a snake oh dear puts snake into raj’s top drawer oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear purell purell purell purell
it is isn’t it oh bother isn’t that just always the way you go to staple something and you’re out of staples gosh i wish i’d known that earlier today when i was at staples
you have a thing of paper clips right there
well no no i need something more permanent to join these papers say don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer
all right opening drawer who do we have here
it’s a snake a terrifying snake
oh did some bad man put us in a drawer
stop talking like that you’ve been rendered speechless by fear
let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice
i tried to scare an indian with a snake come on cooper you’re better than this
okay well i’d offer you halloween candy but that’s gone so what’s up
okay we used to go out right
oh my god that’s where i know you from
i’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life so i know that might be weird for us to talk about but in this area as you know all my other friends are just so stupid
so you’re okay talking about this
you know what if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy then i would be fine with that
okay good because there’s this one guy i used to date who’s about to be forcefed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point
okay uh here it is is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
i met this girl and she’s great we have a lot in common
no we just made out a little
oh look at you you bad boy did you tell her about priya
well i was gonna but there were too many tongues in my mouth
here’s the thing i i’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman
the problem is i want to be one of those guys
so sleep with the new girl and lie to priya
oh that’s not who i am
all right then break it off with the new girl
now let’s not do anything rash she’s really hot
if you like this girl so much why don’t you just end things with priya
priya and i are in love i think we could get married someday
leonard you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it
what does your gut tell you
go ask penny she’ll know what to do
hello howard i’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest allow me to say job well done grabs his own hand electrocutes himself perfect
hey well see you i’m going out starts to go out doesn’t
i thought you were leaving the apartment
yeah me too i can’t make up my mind
are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies
no i’m having a moral crisis
well if it’s of any help i’ve read all the great moral philosophers including dr seuss
oh what the hell i’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store alice but i don’t know if i should because i’m going out with priya but she’s in india
all right so the topic at hand is sexual fidelity probably won’t be relying on seuss here although one fish two fish red fish blue fish might be surprisingly applicable go on
well they say at the end of your life you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did and i’m pretty sure alice is the stuff i want to do
you know the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men
it’s worth noting that he died of syphilis
on your way home will you pick up some orange juice
do you mind i’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now
is one of those things your fondness for orange juice
that’s not my mom it’s bernadette
it just occurred to me that i never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials so i hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand put ‘er there you old soandso
well i i’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours don’t you think it could have waited until then
holy smoke why didn’t i think of that you’re a better man than i howard wolowitz you put ‘er there you son of a gun
whatever takes his hand starts to be electrocuted my… oh… it’s… clutches heart and collapses
oh my god howard what did you do
it was a harmless halloween prank look
howard has a heart condition you know that
well i thought he made that up isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of jewish people
this is adrenaline we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart
you are i’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate and we’ve only got one shot
hurry we’re running out of time
what no you mean this was all a ruse oh how could i be so stu… puts hand to forehead electrocutes himself
damn it i can’t i can’t i can’t do this
uh is it my tongue stud ‘cause if that freaks you out you’re in for a real surprise later on
no no no i i can’t do this believe me i really want to
but i kind of have a girlfriend
you’re cool with you and me just being friends right
i’m so stupid i thought for once i’d met a good guy but you’re just another jackass
oh no no you have it wrong no i i was going to be a jackass but i stopped myself i stayed a good guy so i’m gonna pass on the sex but you should know that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness that’s kind of my superpower i’m like captain good guy
it’s okay did the right thing you idiot
uh not so good we have to talk
okay uh here it is i met this girl and i kissed her and i feel terrible about it but it’s done it’s never gonna happen again and i am so so sorry
yeah these things happen they happen to everybody
oh my god you are amazing i mean i don’t deserve you wh what do what do you mean everybody
leonard i didn’t know if i should tell you but i kind of cheated on you too
a couple of weeks ago i slept with my exboyfriend so i guess we both messed up a little
no no i messed up a little you messed up a lot
oh yeah it is and you won i i i’m i’m sorry i have to go i don’t believe this
so bernadette how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses
well if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone great
girlfriends i have the answer to our dress problems
twelve years ago my cousin irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding
yes and no all those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free so it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all check it out still in the bags the gowns not the bridesmaids
i don’t know dead people’s dresses
uh i was hoping you wouldn’t notice irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes and sadly as it turned out space heaters
ladies please these four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach but through no one’s fault penny the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined and again i’m looking at no one in particular penny
fine what would you like to talk about sheldon
what would you like to talk about sheldon why do you hate us
i’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists
okay that time you looked at me
who didn’t your skin is like alabaster do you even have pores
topic one fasterthanlight particles at cern paradigmshifting discovery or another swiss export as full of holes as their cheese and converse
all right who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines
through no one’s fault sheldon we’re leaving
sheldon sometimes you forget i’m a lady and with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body
ah new topic women delightfully mysterious or batcrap crazy
totally what’s wrong with cap sleeves if you have the right figure for it they’re adorable
hey amy what brings you to our neck of the woods
your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy
she popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease
it’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious and yet somehow you do it
that’s fun to have in a lunchroom
the real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to and maybe you choose the beadyeyed little mother who’s been biting you all week
please we’re eating can we get that off the table and change the subject
can we stand back while i turn this conversation into a conversensation
i have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke come on people it’s just a giant thistle to zzz the onamonapoetry of sleep
amy how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me
i don’t know four or five years
no it’s not gonna do it
oy bernadette keeps texting me pictures of penny in bridesmaid dresses
why are they asking me about this stuff what guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is raj raises his hand
leonard’s coming down the home stretch come on horsey you can do this damn come on thigh muscles you can do this yes first place i would have been a great jockey if i weren’t too tall and scared of horses sheldon you’re up
come on it’s your turn we said we’d get more fresh air
sorry i’m a little distracted i can’t seem to get in touch with amy i tried email video chat tweeting her posting on her facebook wall texting her nothing
did you try calling her on the telephone
the telephone you know leonard in your own simple way you may be the wisest of us all voice mail curiouser and curiouser
if you’re worried we can go over there and see if she’s all right
okay you know i heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood
i don’t think amy was eaten by a bobcat
who thinks amy was eaten by a bobcat
leonard i was just mentioning an interesting local news item now thanks to you i’m worried amy’s been eaten by a bobcat
how can i you won’t stop talking about it
everybody hurts sometimes everybody cries everybody hurts sometimes
she sounds weepy i don’t like weepy let’s go
uh she’s your friend step up
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy bye
i’m single i don’t need this crap
sheldon what are you doing here
you didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications
would you like to talk about it and keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer
sheldon my world is crumbling around me
point of order as you’re in distress it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage but i’m a guest in your home so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage how do you want to proceed visavis beverages
if you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you uh word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted
penny and bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me
and that made you feel sad
i knew it just keep going i guess i’m good at this
it’s just i thought they liked hanging out with me but i guess i was fooling myself
when they were over here did you fail to offer them a beverage ‘cause i can see how that could stick in someone’s craw
sheldon i’m going to ask you something and i’d like you to keep an open mind
at this moment i find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact
oh boy you know ours is a relationship of the mind
proposal one wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins
counterproposal i will gently stroke your head and repeat aw who’s a good amy
how about this french kissing seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base
neck massage then you get me that beverage
very well oh boy they cuddle awkwardly
i’m just saying second base is right there
mm i’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache
for all those girls out there looking for the indian monopoly man
this is not a safe place you can’t share anything here
the two of you need to get your women in line
last night i was strongarmed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional amy farrah fowler this on a night that i had originally designated for solving the spacetime geometry in higherspin gravity and building my lego death star and why your gal pals penny and bernadette went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without amy an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me the future of string theory or my lego fun time
what do you want us to do about it
you clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence get your women in line you make them apologize to amy and set things right i am a man of science not someone’s snuggle bunny
why do i have to talk to penny she’s not my girlfriend
you invited her to lunch four years ago everything about her is on you you make it so
oh he was up late last night so i gave him an early dinner and put him to bed
yeah but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play
so listen guys the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of amy she’s kind of upset
her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her
i told you that would happen
okay look this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it
she keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other
yeah and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the three menstrateers
we thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her i feel terrible
i know me too we’ll talk to her hey wait how did she find out
raj did it and he says he would do it again okay i’m sorry you sent me the picture i wasn’t thinking
well hey i’m usually pretty good at not blabbing you tell me tons of stuff about these guys and i never repeat it
oh you know just pillow talk you guys have nothing to worry about
hold on did you talk about us when we were dating
no all your little secrets are fine
come on tumour come on tumour mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma yay brain tumour probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news
well look we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day
that’s not necessary it’s like sesame street says one of these things is not like the other one of these things should die alone
look come on amy look let us make it up to you we’ll have a girl’s night we’ll do whatever you want
we can go down to the korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other
it’s okay i’m glad this happened i can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cutein
don’t i’ll be okay you’re not the first girls i thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me it’s like elementary school junior high high school undergrad grad school and that semester abroad in norway all over again
you don’t get it look at this brain
this is us bernadette you are the analytical scientific left hemisphere penny you’re the creative spontaneous right hemisphere and where’s amy she’s right here the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with
amy you’re not a tumour penny tell her she’s not a tumour penny is vomiting in the dustbin
did you know that when alexander graham bell invented the telephone he proposed answering it with ahoy ahoy i like it amy is that you have you been drinking i’m sorry i bet my sweet what well all right we’re on our way
it would seem amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot
leonard be glad you can’t keep a woman they are a handful
oh look it’s sheldon and little leonard hi little leonard
yes cuddles we cuddled grow up leonard
amy what are you doing here
well i came here to get a bottle of wine like penny taught me to do when you’re sad
yeah but why didn’t you go back to your apartment
didn’t you go to high school leonard parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out not that the rat bastards ever invited me
maybe we should get you home
oh hang on hang on hang on sheldon what would it take for you to go into that liquor store buy a bottle of hooch take me across the street to that motel and have your way with me
yeah sheldon what would it take
i’m begging both of you please let’s go
whee ooh finally someone found second base
i know how you feel i got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe too
what do you want do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back
i never gave you a friendship bracelet
when we first met i made one and pretended you gave it to me you can have it back if you want
no you made that for you i want you to have it
we know you’re upset and you have every right to be but if it’s okay with you we’d like a second chance to make things right
we are really sorry and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you
which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding
what wait is this some kind of practical joke like in norway when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter
no i i want you to be the maid of honour
oh my gosh no one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before well that’s not true once but then they all died
yes yes oh my gosh i i have so much to do there’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party what should we do for the bachelorette party oh i know we’ll go to a native american sweat lodge we’ll take peyote roll around in the mud and paint fertility symbols on bernadette’s naked body so that’s happening
yeah sure sure vegas is fun too
i feel like crying of course i could just be hormonal oh wait maybe our menses are finally syncing up bernadette no penny
maid of honour amy farrah fowler’s amazing behindthescenes wedding video take one
we’re just trying on dresses do we really need to record this
i’m sorry are you the maid of honour
what are you a nun come on bestie let’s see some skin
you think they don’t have mirrors in there i know how i look
what is taking you so long opens door penny is in her underwear
oh amy get the hell out of here
– sorry sorry swings camera away then back again
oh hey you work the lunch shift
yeah i’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad do you know how to cook it
damn it should have liberated the iffy chicken what are you and professor fussyface up to tonight
haven’t you seen that movie like a thousand times
not on bluray only twice on bluray
well i’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight you want to go
you know we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up
oh it’s not a date leonard it’s just a man and a woman hanging out and not having sex at the end of the night
sounds like most of my dates
oh dear lord get away from me you monster
well he’s smart and crazy enough he may have actually created a monster they enter sheldon is by the window
what the hell is going on
there’s a bird outside the window and he won’t go away that is the hell that is going on we have no worms or seeds here shoo shoo
really on top of everything else you’re afraid of birds
it’s called ornithophobia and someday it will be recognized as a true disability and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building which is unfortunate because i have a fear of nets
great i’ll see you later and remember he’s more afraid of you than you are of him
no i was talking to the bird
knock knock knock go away bird knock knock knock go away bird knock knock knock go away bird
good idea attention is what birds want pulls curtain oh much better all right now i’ll just get along with my life bird squawks make a pot of tea leonard it’s going to be a long night
quick what does a hawk sound like
please that’s a seagull if you’re not going to help don’t help
sorry do you think i’m overdressed
it depends on the activity for a prostate exam yes if you’re playing vegas i’d add sequins
i’m going to the movies with penny i don’t want her to think that i think it’s a date
do you think it’s a date
no but she might think i think it’s a date even though i don’t
or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t
you’re right i’m fine i’m wearing this
really a blazer all right leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room sheldon dials phone yes hello this is dr sheldon cooper yeah i’m at 2311 north robles avenue yeah i’d like to report a dangerous wild animal a blue jay i’m sorry this is animal control i don’t understand the laughter no the bird is not in my home if he was in my home i obviously would have called 911 sir i have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of being stuck in a deadend public service job or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a deadend public service job or spiders don’t you think i tried making cat noises
for an audience with the queen yes for an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can you look great leonard leaves again sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window what am i thinking whiskers
oh hey if we hurry we can make the new jennifer aniston movie
oh yeah sure there’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in south america
okay but the jennifer aniston movie has jennifer aniston and she’s not building a dam
can’t argue with that i’ll get the tickets
actually you know what i think it’s about time i pick a movie we see
no you always picked and it was always the same an hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along
but come on that is a great movie and it starts in ten minutes
yes i do the only reason i went is because you wanted to see them and i wanted to have sex to this day i can’t see a sandra bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused
okay so while we were going out how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me
does this sound familiar i’d love to go shoe shopping with you hiking it’s great it’s two am of course i want to go to korea town and sing karaoke with your friends who wouldn’t
okay we were going out you were going to get sex anyway
really you would have slept with me after a threehour documentary on dams
see now that’s the great thing we’re out as friends this is not a date sex is off the table so let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is sorry spoiler alert
thanks tickets are eleven bucks not a date
if we don’t start soon george lucas is going to change it again
this would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator
i have a masters degree from mit
yeah but you’ve got a cando attitude and that’s what’s important
i really don’t get your problem with birds
the question you should be asking is what is their problem with me my first memory a hummingbird divebombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup
hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world
still my first choice for an ankle tattoo or a dolphin i go back and forth
age seven a bloodthirsty chicken chases me up a tree age twelve a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth age sixteen a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass need i go on
yes please this is way better than the movie
all right sheldon your bird death ray is ready
it’s not a death ray it’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off trust me if i had a death ray i wouldn’t be living here i’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of earth gave me for not using my death ray all right and in three two one switches on all the windows shatter the bird doesn’t move
come on you enjoyed the movie i saw you tearing up when the village got flooded and everyone had to relocate
no i was thinking how come they get to leave and i can’t
i’m going to get some fries you want anything
are you sure because you always say no and then you eat half my fries
i just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like
no i love them i save them for the end but they’re gone because you ate them and why did i let you eat them
exactly but this is not a date so i ask again would you like anything
all right i’d like an order of fries
great that’ll be five dollars i am having the best time i’m so glad you suggested we do this
a screenplay its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay
oh penny nice to meet you
i’ll let you get back to your date
oh no no this isn’t a date no right
so have you written anything i might have seen
that depends how much time do you spend on yelp
this is ridiculous i’m a grown man from texas this isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose it’s just a blue jay opens window that’s a pretty big blue jay closes window goes to cabinet comes out wearing a boba fett helmet and a broom one two three opens window go shoo amscray irdbay bird flies in window bird in the apartment bird in the apartment sees the bird sitting in his place no
so it is an amazing documentary they need the electricity from the dam but at the same time they want to preserve the environment
you’re kidding me uh can i see you for a sec over here
oh yeah sure just one sec
you’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because i said we weren’t on a date
no i’m talking to him because he’s cute
come on he’s not that cute
yes he is with his dorky tshirt and his little hipster glasses
i wear dorky tshirts and glasses
yes but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones you’re doing it ironically
if that’s so what if i start talking to a girl
good go there are some girls right over there what are you waiting for
they’re in a group i’m scared
sheldon what do you expect us to do
you’re biologists biology is the study of living things that’s a living thing get cracking
i specialize in microorganisms and amy studies brains
yeah neither of us minored in birdshooing
oh come now your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class
come back in sheldon he’s not going to hurt you he looks friendly i think he might be someone’s pet
no bernadette don’t be a hero
yes it’s very sweet now slowly and carefully flush him down the toilet
sheldon the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it just like you did with the mailman
every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds i’m not going to be another statistic
look how sweet he is come over and say hi come on you can do it don’t be scared come on oh just pet the bird you big baby
i did it i actually did it okay now flush him
so leonard what do you do for fun
um let’s see hiking karaoke in koreatown any jennifer aniston movie
no it’s fine you can ditch away
oh no no we said we were going to hang out let’s hang out
it’s cool go back to kevin
interesting so now that he’s gone you want to hang out with me
don’t worry about it you know there’s some guys over there you should go talk to them
no no i want to know what you told her
that’s kind of between me and…
oh okay i see so while he was telling you things did he mention he owns not one but two star trek uniforms
yeah wears them not just for halloween
hey pal you didn’t see me telling kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter
okay then i’ll return the favour and i won’t tell…
laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated
when you were telling kevin about your acting career did you mention your longrunning role as waitress in a local production of the cheesecake factory
did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler
maybe i’m not done hanging out with… laura has gone you’re right it’s getting late
it’s remarkable all that time spent in fear and for what he’s magnificent oh dear i just realized i haven’t offered you a beverage
oh it’s just like my grandma with her parrot and after she lost her marbles with her remote control
my phone’s on the desk over there take a picture of us together make it good enough to go on a mug a mouse pad and a calendar if you were a dove i’d call you loveydovey oh who am i kidding this isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal you’re just my little loveydovey aren’t you
guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here
i still think he looks like someone’s pet maybe we should put up posters
yes it should have a big picture of him and the words is this your bird not anymore we’re going to have so much fun together you can carry messages to all my enemies i can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite
if you’re keeping him i’ve got a cage you can borrow one of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck it was both tragic and hysterical
nonsense no loveydovey doesn’t sleep in a cage no loveydovey sleeps in his very own nest which i’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room isn’t that right ld opens window bird flies out no where are you going come back loveydovey this is your home now i already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of amazon he’s gone
how could he do this to me get back here you stupid bird so i can love you
okay so we went out saw a movie met some nice people said horrible things about each other in public all in all a pretty magical night
okay i’m not innocent in all this but you basically called me stupid you asthmatic dumbass
i know i i i crossed a line and i’m sorry no no no hang on i really mean it and it’s not like when we were going out i’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed this is a 100 sexisoffthetable i’m sorry
all right thank you i’m sorry too
just to be clear sex is off the table right
maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends
i don’t know up until the last part i was kind of enjoying takecharge leonard with a little backbone picking the movie knowing what he wants a little cocky
well then i’m putting sex back on the table what do you think about that
you do because if that’s what you like i can be that guy i swear i’ll be anything you want me to be
i am such an asthmatic dumbass i had a weird night
mine was great i’m going to be a mommy reveals nest with an egg in it
it’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally
it’s probably for the best for a lot of these guys the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets
oh that reminds me i get fresh sheets tonight yay
well what do you think of new comic book night magic huh
sheldon i’m disappointed as a brilliant man you’re entitled to a vice i could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport but this lameo
well a comic books employ storytelling through sequential art a medium that dates back 17000 years to the cave paintings of lascaux and b you play the harp like that’s cool
can i help you find anything
a comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device
sorry most of the guys who come in here like big boobs couple of them have big boobs
hey look the new warlords of ka’a expansion pack is out
a new one unbelievable they just keep making up more cheesy monsters slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop it’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid
they’re not even trying remember the satanimals pack with the hellephant why absurd what was he a bad elephant who died and went to hell what could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation
wild west and witches what kind of loser cares about a showdown between billy the kid and the white wizard of the north
a total loser obviously a guy with a sixshooter beats an old man with a magic wand
well hohold on what if the wizard casts a helmet of confusion spell on billy the kid’s cowboy hat
what please this is billy the kid we’re talking about i mean the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words what the hell is billy the kid doing in the mystic realm of ka’a
leonard what’s the deal with sheldon’s friend amy are they a couple
well i mean she didn’t look through me with soulsucking ballshriveling hatred and contempt i like that in a woman could you run it by sheldon if i could ask her out
stuart settle an argument for us who would win billy the kid or the white wizard
if i tell you that i’m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical rootin’ tootin’ low price of 2495
i hate all of you and myself three
i’ll ring it up like shooting nerds in a barrel
hey can i talk to you about something it’s a little awkward
i know what this is about given the professional standstill you’re at you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching yes and if i may suggest consider changing disciplines yeah to the humanities perhaps history one of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things you know you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back you could have fun with that
yeah that’s not it stuart’s kind of interested in amy
oh of course he is she’s very interesting did you know when she was 14 she severed the webbing between her own toes
no he wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out
i’m not sure how to respond leonard i don’t own amy can’t own a person at least not since 1863 president lincoln freed the slaves come on leonard if you’re going to teach history these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know
you know what never mind i’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out
the question is moot there is no way that stuart an impoverished peddler of picture books would be at all appealing to amy farrah fowler a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia
all right but just for the record i checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it
fine the record shall so reflect now getting back to the problem at hand what to do with a washedup experimental physicist
oh leonard lots of people love you and want to help you but they can’t until you admit the problem
well ladies we killed the bottle
okay don’t judge me so what do you want to do go to the movies go dancing lay down for a little bit
excuse me i’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game and i’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people what do you say bestie we can do shirts and skins i’m shirts called it
i’m too small for twister and roller coasters and sitting with my feet on the floor hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes mom
hey you know my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me and i turned out just fine hey look i have peach schnapps thank god
i think a boy likes me
hi it’s stuart we met at the comic book store i was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime it’s okay if you say no it might be the kick in the pants i need to start taking zoloft
amy little vixen just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester
what are you going to do doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend
oh she doesn’t have a boyfriend she has a sheldon so do you like stuart
i don’t know he’s nice he’s funny he has the sallow drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland that’s kind of hot
okay look sweetie we all love sheldon but you’ve been with him over a year now if it’s not going anywhere what does it hurt to look around
well yeah i guess they’re not engaged like me and howie
yeah for what it’s worth engaged people can look around too lot of options out there
yeah i don’t get it either
i want to return this wild west and witches ka’a expansion pack
sorry i don’t do returns they’re hard
sure sure uh when will stuart be back
i don’t know he went out for coffee with a girl
oh i guess i was wrong
am i okay leonard i’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a nobel prize and cities named after me all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction and my bowel movements run like a german train schedule am i okay
flaming spittoon and for the record i’m very disappointed in you cowpokes we’re playing our inaugural round of wild west and witches and i’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion spits into a spittoon patooie
we’re not wearing cowboy hats sheldon it looks ridiculous
and i suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous too
did it look ridiculous when we got the satanimals pack and i dressed up as a beelzebobcat
all right fine let’s just play
we should go easy on him amy’s out with stuart tonight
wait a minute are you telling me that sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman
cluck cluck cluck what are we ladies at a quilting bee or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town
and may i point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with stuart and amy not me i think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here walks away with spurs jangling
hey guys check it out the deluxe limited edition wild west and witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin
oh come on no we just bought the regular pack
with a hologram nice hey do you see this
i’m in the matrix leonard i see everything
you’ve got to be kidding me you friended stuart on facebook
i thought you didn’t like facebook anymore
don’t be silly i’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact
please you’re looking at facebook to find out how their date went
really you think i care if a man what shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady
you are free to believe whatever you like and unfriend rajesh koothrappali
oh yeah now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like i can’t believe i waited this long to make my own potpourri
sheldon why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for amy and you don’t want her going out with other men
here’s a radical thought go oldschool challenge stuart to a fight i mean nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed
that’s all of us can i use the laptop
i have to buy that stupid collector’s tin
i came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me
a date you and me dining dancing perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight
god are you trying to make amy jealous
no why is everyone so obsessed with amy and stuart and whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight
okay listen to me playing games is not gonna help get amy back
i am not trying to get her back but out of curiosity what is a way
all right honey let me tell you a story there was a guy i liked and i never told him how i felt eventually he started going out with someone else and i always regretted it do you see where i’m going with this
are you sure that would explain so much your constant presence in my apartment that baffling dalliance with leonard just to be near me the way you call me sweetie all the time
look sheldon all i’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to amy
strap on a pair of what skates
oh sweetie you are so not the guy
if you’re bored you can go i understand
no i’m having a nice time
excuse me excuse me pardon me pardon me excuse me hi stuart
sheldon what are you doing here
the thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like stuart is repellent no offence stuart
none taken although repellent is kind of a kind of a strong word
i’m sorry this causes you discomfort but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship i can put myself in any repellent situation i want
i believe i would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship
with the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever physical or otherwise i would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend
interesting now try it without the quadruple negative
fine amy will you be my girlfriend
well that’s enough of that sorry to interrupt you two enjoy your date here’s a dollar for your troubles get yourself some sour patch kids
so other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy this was nice
yes well thanks for seeing me to my door
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy let’s wrap things up out there
take the hint stuart the lady said good night
how did you get into my apartment
wow is that the kind of nagging i can expect now that you’re my girlfriend good thing i drew this up
i present to you the relationship agreement a binding covenant that in its 31 pages enumerates iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of sheldon lee cooper here and after known as the boyfriend and amy farrah fowler here and after known as the girlfriend
mutual indemnification always is why don’t you start perusing while i set up my notary stamp
feel free to retain a lawyer
penny i said right hand red
yeah i heard you i got red
we should play limbo next no one beats me at limbo
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock amy knock knock knock bernadette
what do you want me to do about it
relationship agreement section 4 booboos and ouchies you have to take care of it
looks like it’s just us playing penny snores penny penny snores louder penny we’re out of wine
hi did sheldon change the wifi password again
yeah it’s “penny already eats our food she can pay for wifi” no spaces
okay if you can’t get me to stop eating your food what makes you think you can get me to stop using your wifi
i believe that you’re capable of great change like when i finally got you to stop saying valentimes day
you want to hear something weird
in the year 2000 pope john paul ii was named an honorary harlem globetrotter
you asked penny if she wanted to hear something weird
yeah because i have something weird to tell her
oh i thought it was a game
there’s this guy jimmy speckerman who used to torment me in high school he sent me a message through facebook he’s in town and wants to have drinks
okay penny if it were a game here are your choices an email from an old acquaintance or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to sweet georgia brown pick
just do it ’cause he’s not gonna let it go
what are you gonna do about your bully are you gonna see him
is this the fellow who peed in your hawaiian punch
no that was a different guy
was he the one who wedgied you so hard your testicle reascended and you spent your whole christmas break waiting for it to come back down
no that was a different different guy
was he the one who used your head to open a nut
oh oh oh was he the one who made you eat your arm hair
no but actually that was this guy’s sister
all right well what do you think he wants
you know the holidays are just around the corner maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there
i told you that was a different guy
hmm that’s too bad we could have spent new year’s eve waiting for the ball to drop
it’s two am what are you doing up
nobel prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from stockholm
sure you want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year
look at these men they’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than god gave a goose you should pay attention leonard someday this could be you up there
so what’s got you up did you have a bad clam
i don’t watch you 24 hours a day i don’t know what you do
it’s this jimmy speckerman thing i can’t decide if i should agree to see him or not of course that might be because the last time i ran into him he made me floss with my own shoelaces
wear loafers look at dr saul perlmutter up there clutching that nobel prize what’s the matter saul you afraid someone’s going to steal it like you stole einstein’s cosmological constant
you know what i am tired of living in fear of this guy i’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things i should have said in high school you know pick on someone your own size you did not have sex with my mother and yes i do know why i’m hitting myself”
oh now perlmutter’s shaking the king’s hand yeah check for your watch gustaf he might have lifted it
i love this dress how come i never see you wear it
‘cause when i wear it it’s a shirt so what’s howard doing tonight
oh they all went with leonard to confront his childhood bully
oh terrific high school quarterback against four mathletes
when leonard gets back i’d love to check his serotonin levels do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood
hmm he’s not crazy about needles but if you get him to go jogging it’ll just pour out of his nose
i don’t think i can meet the girl who was always mean to me tammy bodnick one time while i was in gym class she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker
worst part was it was too big
that’s nothing in ninth grade the girls put rogaine in my hand lotion within six months the nicknames began to fly i think the one that hurt the most was gorilla fingers fowler
oh i don’t know i guess my school was a nice place we didn’t really have bullies
come on no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out
no we weren’t really like that i mean look we played pranks on each other but it was never mean like okay this one girl kathy geiger got really good grades so we blindfolded her tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight
no it was funny everyone laughed
uh probably it’s hard to say she kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth
who would have thought fuzzy fingers fowler is best friends with a bully
what i was not a bully
kind of sounds like you were and maybe a felon
shh that’s how you wind up in a cornfield
how about that guy he looks like he’d hate you
you know i can really do this by myself
hey we’re here to support you buddy
no you’re not you’re here to see if i get my underwear pulled over my head
so have you figured out what you’re going to say to him
you bet i am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school
that’s quite a list i can’t read your handwriting what’s that word
holy crap man it’s good to see you
yeah you too uh jimmy this is sheldon and raj and howard
hi fellas hey can i get a beer wow look at you little leonard hofstadter i hear you’re a bigtime scientist now
and there’s the first zinger ouch
okay come on i read online you’re a physicist at a university you won some medal
congratulations the newcomb medal oh please that’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework
from what i read it sounded like a big deal
oh good lord are we going to stand here and listen to him tear leonard apart like this
hey i won a newcomb medal too
you should have seen this guy back in the day huh he was so little he could fit in just about anywhere lockers trash cans oh man how did you get inside that backpack
oh i can’t take all the credit you helped a lot
yeah we were practically a comedy team
like the black death and europe
jimmy i’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me
okay here it is i have this great moneymaking idea i just need a gear head to get it to the finish line
technically howard’s the gear head leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey
this is just between us right
okay what do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3d
that sounds amazing first movie i’m watching annie
how exactly would these glasses work
how the hell should i know that’s why i need a nerd
i don’t think something like that’s even possible
aw come on you can figure it out you’re like the smartest guy i’ve ever known
the smartest all right you know i may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm but even i know that was a doozy leonard you can’t live in fear of this man forever
you clearly don’t what my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity
leonard i platonically love you man but face it you’re a mess
i think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit
a little bit the man super glued hershey’s kisses to your nipples
that’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples
this is a list of your heinous acts against leonard one of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens
14 is not oh  yeah never mind
nancy you called me nancy for three years
you really need to work on your penmanship
oh man i i don’t know what to say i always thought we were just having some fun
you’re being too kind leonard you ruined him
i help the weak it’s yet another way i’m exactly like batman
hey for the record jimmy wasn’t the reason i wet the bed that one has my mother written all over it
anyway i’m really sorry i made fun of your stutter in high school
uhhuh uhhuh oh god just finish the sentence okay well i’m sorry you feel that way bye no one wants to hear my apologies
i think your mistake is doing it over the phone if they could look into your eyes they’d melt
penny it doesn’t matter what you did in the past you’re a good person now
that’s easy for you to say you weren’t just called a bbbbbitch
perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism which word’s tripping you up assuage or altruism
you’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone
every other week i serve at a soup kitchen downtown
ooh i can’t do that if i stand over a steaming pot my hair just goes boing what else could i do
there’s habitat for humanity building houses for the poor
okay come on i don’t even have my own house i’m going to build one for someone else
how about donating some of your clothes
oh my god that’s perfect ‘cause i have so many clothes i don’t wear and they’re just taking up space and i go shopping to buy more stuff and i have no place to put it this will totally fix that
oh half and half instead of whole milk
seven little marshmallows no more no less
you got one for good luck knock on door i’ll get it
one for good luck must be the kind of math they do at princeton
i want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room stuffing that parrot down your pants what’s this word
oh right junior prom that was not cool man i am so so sorry
yeah i just hope you can forgive me
yeah yeah yeah i drive better drunk you know it makes you pay attention
no no no come on in i’ll make you a cup of coffee
sheldon we can’t let him drive
then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks
you remember sheldon and raj and howard
not really no it’s funny huh leonard back in school i was the winner and you were the loser and now we’re reversed you’re the winner
you’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa
you mind if i use your bathroom
how about that after all these years your big bad high school bully finally apologizes
yeah it kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people
you know what would be nice
as a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years we open our home to jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him i said it would be nice i didn’t say we should do it
ah i feel just like mother teresa except for the virgin part that ship sailed a long time ago
i think mother teresa would have washed the clothes first
yeah well i bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs you know giving really is better than receiving i used to think it was such a cliche but it seems to be the… oh look at these cute jeans someone just threw away
yes to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut
come on they would be so cute on me and ah they go great with this sweater
i don’t think mother teresa… oh that is adorable
in case it comes up again this right here is an imposition
what was i supposed to do he needed a place to sleep it off
you’re soft this world’s going to chew you up and spit you out
yeah you did so uh listen it was great to see you again and  and and thanks for the apology
for all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school
geez you’re still harping on that what a puss
it’s good you really know your way around a kitchen nancy
i’m not going to say i told you so but we could have killed him
i might kill him right now
the dark knight has your back he’s scared but he has your back
okay jimmy it’s time for you to go
yeah all right let me just finish this
no you’re done i want you out of my apartment right now
don’t answer that it’s a trick question i speak from experience
i’m not afraid of you any more jimmy now get out pushes him uhoh
you did it leonard you stood up to your bully
yeah i feel pretty good about myself you think we can outrun him
i don’t need to outrun him i just need to outrun you
i don’t feel good about this
then sit in the car and keep it running
you were right a whole new load
come on yoga top mama needs a new yoga top
check it out bernadette suede boots your size
god they’re cute oh why did they have to be cute
wait wait wait guys just hang on
look at us what are we doing
i was gleefully following you to a life of crime looking forward to the day we might be cell mates i don’t know about bernadette
you know this is wrong let’s put everything back here
it’s okay i serve soup to poor people
completely empty box if you’d like to examine it
mmhmm yep i see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood
little snarky there cello lessons and we have this completely ordinary cylinder if you’d like to examine it
ordinary yet i sense it is dripping with magical potential
oh dear lord a man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the caped crusader only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret
sheldon he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party
as i was saying empty box empty cylinder and ooh voila pulls out a goldfish in a jar
i’m telling you dude there’s a seat on the hogwarts express with your name on it
this is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends by lying to them
a magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition this is an ordinary top hat you’ve chosen that card freely i do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister
can’t you just enjoy the wonder sheldon why must you peek behind the curtain or up the butt
if we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that ryan reynolds was a better choice for green lantern than lovable rogue nathan fillion
sheldon he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids i really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the green lantern movie
don’t be so hard on him it’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear
coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement when i was five billy sparks put a mexican peso up my nose
it’s still there takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security storms out
look i made sheldon disappear tada
next time you should open with that
ooh look who’s out on a date pasadena’s favourite power couple shamy
and that is the answer to the question what is wrong with eating at the cheesecake factory
so are we celebrating anything special tonight
oh yes our relationship agreement specifies that the second thursday of every month or the third thursday in a month with five thursdays is date night
all right without objection the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to any new business
superb this morning i made a palindrome with my alphabits nice hat bob tahecin
sounds like you hit the ground running i have a bit of good news myself my most recent paper on how a cooperative longterm potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of neuron
ooh speaking of good news somebody just hit 100 twitter followers
that’s nice anyway i’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time
yeah me too triple digits i’m not gonna lie feels pretty good
sheldon i’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field
mmhmm mmhmm ooh 101 air’s getting a bit thin up here
so are we ready to order
give me a minute i’m gonna go wash up
well that’s odd we both washed up when we came in it’s probably a euphemism for urination
sheldon what is wrong with you
not much although i can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears i don’t know what it is when they smart munching on eucalyptus i just melt inside
okay amy just told you some exciting news and you acted like it was no big deal
oh i see why you’re confused no her news sounded important but what you’re forgetting is it was an achievement in the field of biology that’s all about yucky squishy things
honey she’s upset you’re her boyfriend you have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by
what if they simply don’t excite me
well just smile and think about koalas
she’d see right through that we go to the zoo all the time she knows my koala face and for future reference it’s this
oh you have a lot of magic stuff
yeah i started when i was a teenager i thought i could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act
ah let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one oh look what my mom made us for the act
ooh i like the fabric where’d she get it
well she cut up one of her old bathing suits she made these two vests and half a dozen napkins
has she tried on the vest yet
i just gave it to her
i hope it fits she has a tricky figure she’s short and stacked like me
she’s not stacked like you ma she never steps on hers
listen howie maybe i’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant
you’ll do fine hand me those rings see you nailed it
you know iit’s just that i’m not that comfortable with little kids
well that’s because you haven’t been around them much this is good practice i mean you are gonna be a mom someday right
ohhoho i haven’t seen this trick in years it’s called the dove pan you let everyone see the pan is empty but there’s a secret compartment in the lid and then you open it and produce a live… don’t look in there
oh a little red dead redemption huh
how come you’re not doing a mission you’re just wandering around
had a rough night i thought i’d go for a walk and clear my head
some people go outside and do that
it’s after nine o’clock at this hour the streets of pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats
you want to talk about it
no i think i’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away
you know digital alcohol is never a solution what’s going on
hard as this may be to believe it’s possible that i’m not boyfriend material
glad i was sitting down for that did you and amy get in a fight
amy had a fight i was being perfectly reasonable i’m gonna have a whiskey do you want anything
no i can’t i’m playing grand theft auto later look i’m no expert in women
that’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you
i’m sorry it’s the alcohol talking go on
sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change
nuts to that what else you got
i don’t know what to tell you buy her something
well you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture
well that approach has sheldon cooper written all over it
it’s appreciated and if you ever manage to find a woman again i’ll be glad to return the favour
and now all the rings are magically linked together my fiancee’s wearing a magic ring too it made all my money disappear
oh ah right bangs drum and cymbal and now the great howdini’s next miraculous illusion
well you’re not getting cake right now capisce
okay okay now my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk
i know how you do that trick
do you know how to pipe down
okay we’re going to roll up this newspaper
you got wax in your ears the man said it’s an ordinary pitcher howdini
okay we’re going to stick this in here puts newspaper into trouser waistband and then i’m going to pour in the milk i hope this works because i didn’t bring a change of pants
look i googled it it’s a fake pitcher
that’s it no cake for you anyone else want to join the no cake club
she’s just kidding boys and girls everyone gets cake
just give me the pitcher behold wrong pitcher
i told you i’m not good with kids
yes you did oh i think my crotch is starting to curdle
the thing is my mother worked fulltime i had to take care of my brothers and sisters
ugh it was horrible with their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices always complaining i don’t want to get dressed joey keeps spitting in my mouth this isn’t the way mom makes waffles well okay put your hand in here let’s see how you like this waffle
all right settle down red light red light red light okay we’re fine
i’m sorry i know it makes me sound like a bad person but i just don’t like children
yeah no we all got that but don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours
right when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and i’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years sure that’ll be completely different
i don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at sears
oh my god now i know what i sound like to you when i say stupid stuff
okay i don’t think amy wants a pocket watch
no but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch
still saying stupid stuff ooh does she like bracelets
well she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin maybe they have a dressier version of that
well how are we doing this afternoon are we looking for anything special perhaps a ring for the lady
snorts trust me we are not a couple
excuse me i don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out you’d be lucky to land a fella like me
snorts trust me we are not a couple
my apologies how can i help you today
he’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present
great trouble with girlfriends is what’s putting my daughter through usc
yes channel set baguettes 20 points total weight
remarkable diamonds crystallized carbon every day people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire but just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars
actually that’s only 750 everything’s on sale
really talk to me about that pocket watch
i’m still trying to wrap my mind around it i always thought i’d be a dad someday
oh me too you’re so caring i’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood
there you go howard sounds like raj’ll have your babies problem solved
hey just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name did she definitely say she didn’t want kids
yeah she doesn’t like them and from what i saw the feeling was mutual
i don’t know i can’t see a life where i don’t have kids i mean people have kids i mean even donkey kong had donkey kong jr so he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at italian plumbers
you know there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them
wow that’s rough where’d you get that
it’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book
maybe me and bernadette aren’t right for each other
look howard i’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea but i watched you dangle your hook in the water for years do not throw her back
i don’t want to but this is kind of a deal breaker
what’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding
huh it’ll kill her on the other hand if i don’t give her grandchildren that’ll kill her too so either way on the mom front i’m golden
what time did you tell amy to be here
eight o’clock sheldon checks pocket watch sheldon that pocket watch is ridiculous
nonsense i look like a train conductor under what pretext did you lure her here
i said hey want to come over and hang out
good good if you had said something clever she might’ve gotten suspicious
okay he wants to talk to you
well i don’t want to talk to him and i’m pretty disappointed in you too although we both know that won’t last
thank you amy i’d like to apologize your accomplishment was impressive and i’m proud of you
we both know that’s your koala face
okay look he bought you this
jewellery seriously sheldon you are the most shallow selfcentred person i have ever met do you really think another transparently manipoh it’s a tiara a tiara i have a tiara put it on me put it on me put it on me put it on me put it on me put it on me put it on me
of course i do i’m a princess and this is my tiara
you’re right the tiara was too much
howard bernadette’s… oh she slipped right by me
you should keep it you could wear it again sometime
don’t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where i don’t get grandkids
don’t worry ma i will as soon as i can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue
i guess you talked to your mom huh
i was upset my mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on if the smell of bengay doesn’t burn your eyes
look it’s obvious having kids is really important to you and i think i came up with a solution
well seeing as how i make way more money than you anyway what if i work and you stay home with the kids
yeah you know you’ll watch barney and pull cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates and i’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life
you know i don’t know if this counted as a fight but how about some makeup sex
i would love that but what is that behind your ear oh look it’s a condom
you feel like trying something new for dinner maybe indian texmex
you ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals
as you know lizards coldblooded animals lack the ability to sense temperature but they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold so lizard weathermen would say things like bring a sweater it’s slow outside i love my mind
we all do now how about dinner
oh i would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards we could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them they’ll just grow back oh my lifesize cardboard mr spock is here i know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion but oh goodie oh goodie oh goodie commander spock requesting permission to be unfolded
which is why the more intelligent the monkey the more faeces they fling
excuse me amy penny do you have plans for dinner tonight
no i mean just you and me
not like a date a date
oh no they sent the wrong spock live long and suck it zachary quinto
this is so exciting if leonard and penny get back together howard and i can go on double dates with them
how come you never invite sheldon and me on a double date
mm uh… how’s it going in there penny
just a sec emerges in revealing slinky green dress too much
you just can’t handle her raw sexuality can you
when did you and leonard break up
why do you think he asked you out again
maybe he’s dying that would be so romantic
too bad if he were she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines
do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight
absolutely not look we’re just gonna have dinner and you know see how it goes
if he were dying would you sleep with him
assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted you know like a spear wound to the head
how do you know are you a doctor
you can makebelieve though sometimes howard and i pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and i’m a sexy cardiologist and the naughty part is i’m not in his hmo network
screw it i’m not gonna make a big deal out of this it’s just dinner
amy stop it oh god i’m so nervous
relax you know leonard’s always been crazy about you it’s gonna be great
i know but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird and what if something goes wrong then what
guess it’ll just be sheldon and me going on a double date with howard and bernadette
sure we’d love that change your clothes we got a lot riding on this
mm i want to build a road but i need wood do either of you fellows have wood raj and howard snigger i don’t understand the laughter the object of settlers of catan is to build roads and settlements to do so requires wood now i have sheep i need wood who has wood for my sheep
well more to the point why are you doing this
did you forget what penny did to you it took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down
i didn’t defile your sister we had a relationship
i heard you call her brown sugar in my book that’s defilement
you want to know my opinion
all right then the reason you’re fixated on a goodnatured simpleton like penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment your brilliant yet intimidating mother
where on earth did you get that from
it’s in her book needy baby greedy baby
it’s called nonfiction for a reason leonard
if they ever make a movie version of that book you know who should play leonard’s mother sandra bullock
now where were we oh yes does anyone have any wood oh come on i just want wood why are you making it so hard
so do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with
oh that’s a good question how about awkward
hey how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date see how that goes
so polly tell me about yourself
okay uh let’s see i’m from nebraska and ever since i was a little girl i dreamed of moving to la and becoming a movie star anyway after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables i’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of anne frank above a bowling alley so you know dreams do come true your turn
uh let’s see uh i am an experimental physicist at caltech most of my research is with highpowered lasers and oh i’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles
oh god no the money’s pretty good and i used the equipment to make my own batsignal
batsignal what are you some kind of nerd
not some kind of nerd i am the king of the nerds
uh it means if anyone displeases me i don’t help them set up their printer
good remember that when i take my shirt off
leonard this is nice i’m so glad we did this
me too so what do you think are we gonna get back together
i’m sorry what did i say
leonard you know i will always have feelings for you
you said always you’ll always have feelings for me
so that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone this isn’t working out but i’ll always have feelings for you i’m sorry i slept with your best friend but i’ll always have feelings for you here’s the thing lisa i’m into dudes now but i’ll always have feelings for you
no it’s not always made it worse
yes you are you always overthink things
ah now thththere you go always made it worse
see this is where everything goes wrong when we talk
well i don’t know how you have a relationship without talking
hey i went out with this guy tj for eight months we never talked to this day i don’t even know what tj stands for
wait if you guys didn’t talk what did you… never mind stupid question
and now that i have some wood i’m going to begin the erection of my settlement
he’s got to be doing this on purpose
ooh eight thirty you and penny decide to go out and paint the town beige
you’re thirty years old and you live with your mother
i guess it didn’t go well
we don’t know that not to a certainty all we know is that leonard is home
again not enough evidence for all we know he’s being murdered now back to our game
you were in the middle of an erection
oh of course it’s right here in my hand
what does she want from me now goes to front door where penny is waiting what’s up
do not overthink this kisses him then leads him to her apartment
okay but earlier it seemed like…
even during ‘cause sometimes i have questions
yeah except for when i got the foot cramp
well there was a lot at stake
so what do you want to do now
well i want to go get my asthma inhaler but it might ruin the moment just just help me out here how does a miserable date end in sex
well i’m a pretty smart guy and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply so give it a go
okay it’s just at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again it got very real very fast and i panicked
why what are you afraid of
well what if we do go out and i do something stupid and dump you again
well how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship it could be more like a new version of software penny and leonard 20 we can test it internally shake out the bugs and if we both feel it’s solid then we’ll roll it out to the public
so we don’t tell people we’re back together
exactly we pretend like our date went badly
well we don’t really have to pretend
and we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool
okay great hey i just remembered i still got one of your inhalers
i can’t believe you kept this
yeah i was gonna throw it away but i just couldn’t
that is so sweet in 25 to 30 minutes i’m gonna show you how much this means to me
yeah hi hi how’s it going
uh can’t complain thanks for asking well what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning
well uh uh what are you doing up
really i didn’t see you in there
obviously when i saw that you were in ours i went and used another one
the the gas station across the street
seems unlikely did you bring your asthma inhaler
uh uh uh yes i did
well then i guess it’s plausible hang on a second mister
after you used the facilities at the gas station did you make a purchase
it’s customary when using the rest room at a retail establishment to make a small purchase did you
here’s two dollars go buy some beef jerky
it’s not about you it’s about a poor immigrant from pakistan trying to make his way in america by working the graveyard shift at the colorado boulevard chevron
leonard will be here in a moment he’s looking for a different parking space
we were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker and i was afraid if we ran into them on the way out i’d be obligated to do so
i’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and penny
me too out of deference to them let’s not flaunt our happy relationship
you have a keen insight into the human heart amy farrah fowler
we are next to a suburu with a gorelieberman bumper sticker
well i doubt they’d want to talk about that so we’re fine
i’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with penny
well hey we’re grownups we can still be friends
boy i don’t know if i could be friends with howie if we broke up
here you go guys let me get you going with some water you need menus or you know what you want
leonard knows what he wants but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you
no that’s okay bernadette sometimes these things just don’t work out
yeah it’s all good wewe’ll always have feelings for each other
see she knew what always meant
wow you’re like a dog with a bone aren’t you
is the point that you don’t know when to let something go
people people please before you say something you both regret i’d like to place my order
yeah just hang on sheldon you know why we can’t be together because you always have to be right
i’ve got to go with leonard on this he is wrong more than anyone i know
you know what i just realized i’m on a break i’ll get someone else
leonard promise me that when our new waitress comes over you will not start a complicated onagain offagain relationship with her because i am very very hungry
mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant
well i was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other that was the plan right
no the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends that’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag
you know what i don’t have to stand here and take this crap goes to penny’s apartment
the hell do you think you’re going
isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now
every scenario i play out for you and me ends badly
this is a disaster i distinctly ordered the leonard nimoy mr spock cardboard standee why would i feel safer with zachary quinto at the foot of my bed
i don’t know he was pretty badass on heroes
you’re right i’ll give him a shot
hang on penny do you have plans for dinner
no i mean just you and me
uh have you thought this through
yes and i think we should go anyway
no can’t do it sorry quinto you’re going back
if you and leonard get back together sheldon and i will finally have someone to go on double dates with
fine we can double with you too so insecure
where are you guys going to eat
well it’s a little late for me to start saying no isn’t it
sorry just remembered i’ve got to stop by the drugstore
hello i’m dr sheldon cooper and welcome to the premiere episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags over the next 52 weeks you and i are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology
hang on dr c what’s vexillology
vexillology is the study of flags
cool i think i just learned something
did you have fun doing it
fun and information are two sides to this video podcast not unlike the only twosided state flag oregon oh look hello mr beaver in future episodes we’ll answer some burning questions what’s the only nonrectangular flag what animal appears most often on flags what animal appears second most often on flags and more
why are you waving a white flag
now today’s episode of fun with flags is not fun but it is important flags
cut did you not see we are rolling
sorry i’m having dinner with penny i have to get out of here
and i have flag knowledge that i have to get out of here
no i’m a little rattled but like the flag over fort sumter i’m still here and take two hello i’m dr sheldon cooper and welcome to the premiere episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags over the next 52 weeks you and i are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology
hang on dr cooper what’s vexillology
vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag
it’s ferdinand t flag i thought he might help bring in some younger viewers
confound it you’re right it’s brilliant let’s take it from the top
that was a really nice dinner i’m glad you asked me out again
you see me all the time you sure you just don’t miss the sex
well yeah sex with you is pretty great have you ever tried it
i have you are not wrong i just think if we’re gonna try dating again we should take things slow
oh i can take it slow did i ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school karen berberick to this day she doesn’t know we were going out made it easier on her when i broke things off
okay well maybe not that slow
how about this are you familiar with the typical development for computer software
you know just for fun let’s say i’m not
before an application is released they give it a trial run wwe could do that and if we hit a rough spot instead of getting mad just say hey we found a bug and we report it so it can be fixed
you mean like a beta test
well technically this would be an alpha test a beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…
seriously do i not get credit for knowing beta test
no you should absolutely that was me being pedantic that’s our first bug you reported it i can fix that see this is good
all right let’s give it a shot
great you keep a list i’ll keep a list at some point we’ll exchange
night attaboy hofstadter nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies hey i’m back
here’s an interesting fact about flags
the flags of liechtenstein and haiti were identical by coincidence a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 olympics and thankfully their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of fascism
i stopped on the way to work hey do you want to peel the plastic off with me
really me that’s like the best part
grab a corner whoa what’s your hurry cowboy savour the moment
speaking of cowboys do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag the tiny landlocked nation of andorra oh the next classic episode of sheldon cooper presents fun with flags is writing itself
oh let me try the voice recognition
hey i let you peel the plastic don’t get greedy to phone hello
look at that there’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to
i don’t have a marital status if that’s what you’re asking
yeah you’re right that’s too personal we hardly know each other how about a cup of coffee

i will see you gentlemen later
she is gonna break his heart

well thank you i’ll see you tomorrow
oh wait here almost forgot here
well that’s quite a list you got there
uh red means fix right away yellow is eh whenever you get a chance and green is i could probably learn to live with it there’s a key down here at the bottom it’s neat huh
look at that some day we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard
what’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list hair too golden laugh too musical world too much a better place for her mere presence in it
how about constantly talks with food in her mouth
her heart’s full of love no one cares what’s in her mouth
so siri what’s happening how are you
what are you doing right now

from now on i’ll call you sexy okay
chimes i found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato seven of them are fairly close to you

you’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine kudos
oh no of course i understand you’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love your secret’s safe with me
heads up pwofessor wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again so we’re going to move up his wetirement party fwiday five o’cwock pot wuck

two weeks to rock hard abs
they kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that don’t they all right look just remember how this works we don’t get mad about these things uh speaking of which i’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning got a really fun evening for you it’s kind of a surprise
all right terrific well let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall we wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy
yeah oh here’s my list for you right there
all right fair enough i certainly can be quieter when we kiss i thought it was an expression of passion but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird who wants that uh uh i’m sorry can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid nah never mind it’s right here
oh an exotic little treat i was just talking to siri about peking duck and she said she knew about four chinese grocers two of which were fairly close to me her spontaneity is contagious
who’s siri is he dating somebody new
oh is that cute or creepy
can i pour you some wine i think you’ll enjoy it the traditional choice with peking duck is a sauvignon blanc but siri suggested an offdry riesling i wasn’t sure but i didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of trader joe’s now what should we put siri in for dinner leopard sparkles or to paraphrase coco chanel you can never go wrong with a little black case siri play some smooth jazz
oh my god kenny g this woman can read me like a book i can’t believe i bought my soul mate at glendale galleria
i don’t know if i want to stay
this is amazing how did you even get this idea
i called your dad i asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid this seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it
okay you’re kind of really great
you mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest
okay bug report i just complimented you you should take it and shut up
and stop apologizing all the time

i have to get a lock for my door
i think you’ll like the drill tonight i’ve tried to make it fun each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by canada pick a catastrophe any catastrophe
sheldon canada is not going to invade california
yeah really you think those hippies in washington and oregon can stop them
all righty an 82 magnitude earthquake devastates pasadena reducing mighty edifices to dust engulfing the city in flames the streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded oh excellent choice now put on your hard hat and safety vest
oh fun i get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the village people
you make that joke every three months i still don’t get it leonard wait what are you doing
i don’t know what am i doing
look around you there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere really you’re going to face armageddon without your orthotics all right your choice grabs him and pushes him over uhoh hypothetical aftershock
and that’s why we wear hard hats
check it out press release from nasa
um expedition 31 will launch this spring to the international space station crew members will include commander tom ‘tombo’ johnson astronaut mike ‘supernova’ novacelik and payload specialist howard wolowitz
this is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter
dude if you’re going to be an astronaut you need to pick a cool nickname
i don’t get to pick it the other guys have to give it to me
oh if i had one it would be brown dynamite
are you not listening to me the other astronauts have to give you your nickname
are you not looking at me i am brown dynamite why do you put six sugars in your coffee
because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine
emergency drill night last night huh
i’ll tell you exactly how he did readiness
you know what i’m so tired i can’t even think straight i’m going home will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later
you can’t go home you have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock
oh can’t you take the bus to the dentist
of course i can it’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia that’s the problem two years ago after a deep gum cleaning i thought i got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to mexico
they put you under for a cleaning
yeah they have to i’m a biter
whatever sheldon i’m exhausted i’m not taking you to the dentist
wrong sir wrong under section 37b of the roommate agreement miscellaneous duties you are obligated to take me to the dentist see it’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products”
you know what i am sick of the roommate agreement it’s ridiculous i’m your roommate not your chauffeur you know i had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in garden grove because the one in pasadena has gotten too big for its britches
hold on are you saying that you want to invoke clause 209
i don’t know what that is but if it means i can go home and sleep then yes
think carefully here clause 209 suspends our friendship and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall demonstrating ‘sup
all right that’s it we are now no longer companions boon or otherwise we are now merely acquaintances to amend the words of toy story you have not got a friend in me
i’m gonna go home and take a nap
yeah well tell it to someone who cares
i got pretty exciting nasa news today next week i fly to houston for orientation and zerogravity elimination drills
he’s gonna learn to poop in space
open the pod bay doors hal
maybe your nickname should be brown dynamite
hello dear friends and dr hofstadter
‘sup my apologies i would’ve been here sooner but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it
oh your concern for me is touching it will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow
i’m sorry sheldon i’m busy i’m right in the middle of my addiction study i’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to o’doul’s
you’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need oh where’d the magic go
sheldon that’s not what girlfriends are for although you don’t use them for what they’re for so what do i know
howard doesn’t make me do his shopping or take him to the dentist or pick up his dry cleaning right
absolutely but when ma’s hips give out you’re up kid
well if amy’s too busy that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs tentatively entitled you’re welcome mankind all right then just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake uh dentist okay we can circle back to that one um well who wants to take me wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes anyone oh that one had hoot written all over it um all right uh dermatologist allergist podiatrist supercuts okay okay here’s a fun one um i need a new picture frame and i have a hankering for swedish meatballs who wants to spend the day with me at ikea
oh hey sheldon can i help you find something today
no no i was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person
you moved up one my pen pal in somalia was kidnapped by pirates so uh how are you
uh not so good my shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note
great great so what’s new with your family how’s your mother is she alive
how about your grandparents they alive
oh i’m so sorry for your loss on a cheerier note i have a teethcleaning appointment this afternoon what do you say you take me over there buddy boy
i’m sorry you want me to take you to the dentist
yes and now i can’t make any promises but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot
sheldon i’m working i can’t take you to the dentist also and i can’t stress this enough i don’t want to take you to the dentist
can’t help a friend out in a time of need huh i see where your therapist was coming from
ooh ooh what about we make your astronaut nickname howard “buzz” wolowitz
you can’t do buzz buzz is taken
no that’s not what i’m talking about
well are you talking about when he thought he was real
okay um how about crash” howard “crash” wolowitz
yeah terrific the other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named crash
all right um how about oh how about rocket man
that’s not bad howard “rocket man” wolowitz
yeah it’s great but i told you i don’t get to pick my nickname it has to come from the other astronauts
maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it
once i tried carrying around a duncan yoyo hoping the other kids would start calling me duncan
no they ended up calling me sock mouth because they took away my yoyo and stuffed their socks in my mouth
okay uh what if we make rocket man your ringtone and the next time you talk to those guys i’ll call you and they’ll hear it plant the seed
that’s actually not a terrible plan
they don’t call me brown dynamite for nothing
hey did you ever make it to the dentist
not necessary no i found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning mostly they cater to dogs but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind
all right sheldon if you need me to take you to the dentist i will take you to the dentist
are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to reestablish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement
absolutely if you admit that you’re a 30yearold man who’s incapable of functioning on his own
ooh sock mouth’s got him on the ropes
i will admit nothing of the sort and now if you’ll excuse me i have to call my dentist and see if i can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped
oh good your power’s out too
because last month i sent the electric company a starbucks gift card an apology note and a few snapshots of me in a bra
what happened to all your glowinthedarkemergencyexit stuff you had painted on the floor
oh that was wildly carcinogenic anyway it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship because i happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency please try not to see anything by this light it’s not for you
it’s just a blackout i’m sure the power will be back on soon
and i’m sure some fool in the donner party said the snow would stop any day now i like to think they ate him first
you know i got some candles in my apartment
but candles during a blackout are you mad that’s a fire hazard no pasadena water and power recommends the far safer glow stick
you call that a glow stick that is a glow stick come on let’s go
before you go consider this not only do i have a deepcycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system i also have all 61 episodes of the bbc series red dwarf and fiddlefaddle all yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement
i’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop
oh he’ll be back wine and a girl in the dark he’s gonna be bored out of his mind
to wine and bubble wrap and to not having to watch sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water
you know in girl scouts tammie dinisha said you could do that with panty hose boy was she wrong anyway you want to make out
i thought because our relationship’s in a beta test you wanted to take things slow
okay do you want to make out slow
i can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth
ugh well lucky for you there’s nothing else to do right now
since when don’t you knock it’s like the only good thing about you
social niceties have been suspended leonard we’re in a state of a emergency the world has descended into darkened turmoil lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day
i’m making s’mores i wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire
yes or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement
really huh okay in that case i will have a s’more by myself and then i’m gonna have s’more by myself
no don’t aw him he brought this all on himself
no he’s crazy sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in
i think he misses his little buddy
fine but mark my words this frustrating bogus teenage makeout session is not over
i thought you said candles were dangerous
this is a bunsen burner i’m a scientist i know what i’m doing oh drat his s’more is on fire he dunks it in a glass of water aw it took me a gallon of urine to make that water
listen sheldon this is stupid i don’t see why we can’t be friends and i’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff i just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement
that we go back to the way things were but when i do something for you you show a little appreciation
and how would i do that
counterproposal we reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum in the spirit of mother’s day or father’s day once a year we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life both actual and imagined by you we could call it leonard’s day
i kind of like the sound of that
of course you do it’s about you like everything else lights come back on oh thank goodness i don’t think i had it in me to make another glass of water
so do i get breakfast in bed on leonard’s day
can i sit in your spot
of course you get a card it’s leonard’s day
hey guys the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch
really who do you think did that sheldon
oh i don’t know but whoever that mystery man was you should be eternally grateful for without him there would be no leonard’s day
oh no pressure just get him a crummy card you’re good
all right test my ring tone that really is a good song
oh yeah there’s a reason he’s sir elton john they don’t make you a knight for writing wake me up before you go go
howard are you coming down for breakfast
ma i told you i have a video conference with nasa i said don’t bother me
oh listen to mr big shot astronaut
yes please listen to mr big shot astronaut hey good morning
mass that’s a cool nickname ‘cause force equals mass times acceleration
yeah it’s just short for massimino anyway the plan for this morning is to go over the…
what is that is that rocket man
yeah my ring tone kind of my favourite song rocket man
howard your fruit loops are getting soggy
gentlemen i think i’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science physics madlibs now give me a number
good one and an electrical charge
ha perfect okay get this professor jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon five times the limit of e to the upsilon as in a laughs uncontrollably okay no no i’ll start over professor laughs again
i haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day leonard made that multiplication error
oh oh lord that multiplication error he thought he carried the one but he didn’t
it’s not funny that mistake got published
stop i’m going to wet myself
hey guys guys president siebert is headed this way
doesn’t look happy so i’m guessing he wants to talk to sheldon
oh president siebert i assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions i put in the box by your office
no and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere
you don’t like written suggestions you don’t like when i give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room if i didn’t know any better i’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions
dr cooper the physics department chair tells me you’re refusing to take your vacation
you’re obligated to take one and i’d also like you to know the mostoften received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can dr cooper take a vacation okay settled then i’ll see you all on monday except for you
but if i don’t come into work what am i supposed to do with myself
read rest travel i hear afghanistan is nice this time of year
that tonight’s gonna be a good night and tonight’s gonna be a good night and tonight’s gonna be a good good night tonight’s the night uh uh let’s live it up uh i got my money let’s spend it up…
good lord would you stop that caterwauling
what the hell are you doing
what are you doing hiding back there
i’m sneaking into work now if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket you tell him it’s some lobster traps
yes that’s how velma and scooby smuggled shaggy into the old lighthouse
what are you going to do when you get to the university people are going to recognize you
will they leonard puts on cap and longhair wig
fine just get back under your blanket and i’ll drive you there
i have gps on my phone i know you turned around
i’m so glad you talked howard out of having your wedding invitations in klingon
turn it over i’m hoping my relatives think it’s hebrew
this is really happening i’m gonna be a maid of honour i’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and finally i will have my special day
they’re gonna need an extralarge veil for somebody’s head
if i ever actually ever get married
my dad because i make a lot more money than howie he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a prenup
parental pressure can be daunting i remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs last year i finally gave in and let her do it
i just don’t know how i’m gonna break it to him
you know i’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him that’s how i told my high school boyfriend i slept with his brother that’s how i told his brother the same thing
i don’t know i don’t want to manipulate him with sex
oh sweetie that’s what sex is for
you know the connection between marriage and money is nothing new in fact the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father for example you’re adorable intelligent and a good earner i could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose to penny you would fetch a unicorn
sheldon there are a million great vacations you could take what about hawaii
hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to lost was filmed mahalo for nothing hawaii
how about florida they’ve got cape canaveral they’ve got disney they’ve got my aunt ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy plus if you get sweaty enough her plasticcovered furniture is like a flume ride
my family took a trip to florida when i was a child a seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach i got the message
you know if i had a week off i’d go back to the two bunch palms resort and spa in the desert i tell you an hour on the massage table with trevor and you’ll feel like you were born without bones
i don’t think i could ever let a guy give me a massage
really what was i doing to your neck last night while you were playing xbox
it’s like i’m living in a dictatorship you must take a vacation you must have fun you must enjoy life
i don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships
one time they tried to make richard feynman take a vacation but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new he went to work in his friend’s biology lab richard feynman was a famous american physicist part of the manhattan project
everyone in the world of science knows who richard feynman was
now you do too oh i have a brilliant idea amy’s a biologist i’ll go work in her lab
ten seconds ago you never heard of him now you’re an expert
is that your laundry you only have like six things in there
yeah i didn’t have any quarters so i’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day hey if i tell you something will you promise not to tell anybody
it doesn’t matter what i say you’re gonna tell me anyway
what that is not true bernadette wants a prenup
so you’re saying if i became a famous movie star we got married you wouldn’t sign a prenup
absolutely not if i’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with ryan gosling then leonard gots to get paid so you think about us getting married
i think about a lot of things i think about us getting married i think about us breaking up once in a while i think about how i didn’t leave a note on that mercedes i dinged in the parking lot last month but then i have a glass of wine and it passes
joke all you want but you think about it
well tell you one thing if i ever do get married no klingon invitations
good luck catching a man with that attitude
boy oh boy this vacation is off to a wonderful start the smell of formaldehyde the whir of the centrifuge the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection mm i can already feel my cares just melting away
i’m excited to work with my boyfriend it’s gonna be romantic
come on sheldon we can be like marie curie and her husband pierre who spent their days working side by side bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her screw beauty and the beast that’s the love story disney should tell
okay what do we start with maybe splicing some genes clone a sheep perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back haha i’m a freak
oh i’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers
wash those bea… oh i get it a little hazing for the new fella yeah i’d better keep and eye out for what shoe polish on the microscope or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich
no i just need those beakers washed hippityhop quick like a bunny
what excuse me you have dr sheldon cooper in your lab you’re gonna make him do the dishes that’s like asking the incredible hulk to open a pickle jar
sheldon you’ve never worked in a lab like this before you have no experience in the field of biology
i have plenty of experience in biology i bought a tamagotchi in 1998 and it’s still alive let’s do this
no hi raj no how are you raj just straight to where’s the other white guy
i’m sorry so listen i heard something about him can you keep it between us
ooh gossip when i first got here i thought you americans really gossiped around the water cooler so i hung out there for like a month but the only gossip i ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler
bernadette wants to get a prenup
oh that’s a shame he’s gonna be devastated
i never know what to do in these situations should i give him a headsup
hmm i’m gonna give you the same advice i yell at the tv when the bachelor’s handing out roses follow your heart
check it out look at the size of that rice krispie treat same price
hey howard i need to tell you something
i know it’s not on my wedding diet i don’t care
uh listen i heard that bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a prenup
you know what it’s not a big deal she makes more money than me she wants to protect her financial interests it’s completely reasonable
yeah actually it’s good for both of us i have assets to protect too
i’ve got some rare comic books the vespa’s almost paid off and ma and i have a primo double cemetery plot at mt sinai right near the guy who played mr roper on three’s company
mr roper’s dead you can’t just spring that on a guy
here you go this is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by carl sagan
yyou’re being ridiculous those are perfectly clean
sheldon this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis if it’s in fact perfectly clean drink from it
all right perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley i need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes
there was something wrong with that detergent that was way too bubbly
i intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter
yeah good for you now start counting
you know what this place needs a suggestion box
how’s counting going when i was in kindergarten i recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show i think i got this
this is preposterous i think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do i’ll show you up
really is that what you think
yes that’s what i think and i’m super smart so it’s probably true
hey i’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years you’ve been here for three hours and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom
i’m sorry it takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet
sheldon i’ve given you the simplest things to do and you haven’t done one of them right
maybe that’s because i’m not being challenged it’s the same reason einstein failed math
maybe the math was too bubbly for him
you think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain they could do the same thing at any quiznos and they’d offer to toast it for me too
okay smart guy i’m about to remove the locus coeruleus which is incredibly delicate work have at it
all right i’m no stranger to a little gray matter locus coeruleus locus coeruleus
you’re getting warmer it is indeed in the brain hope your hands are steady it’s the width of a single hair but this is just biology so i’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you
it’s not i’ll have you know in the field of physics we work with particles so small they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus ie when your locus coeruleus sits around the house it sits around the house
oh are we nervous dr cooper
no what you see is a man trembling with confidence does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much
i’m on vacation social convention dictates that i let my hair down at a local watering hole social convention is stupid
you know i have ten fingers and ten toes if i tell you a story about each one of them we’ll be here all day let’s just move on
ah seeing as i’m on vacation a pina colada seems appropriate extra pineapple slices extra whipped cream extra cherries extra umbrellas and uh hold the rum don’t let me have too many of those
hey what are you guys doing here
we’re grown men we drink at bars
no and no everything okay with you and bernadette
you know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens
all right howard wolowitz listen up you sign anything she puts in front of you because you are the luckiest man alive if you let her go there is no way you can find anyone else speaking on behalf of all women it is not gonna happen we had a meeting and you a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood
excuse me this is a fairly substantial wound removes plaster faints again
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
i was kind of hoping i could continue vacationing in your laboratory after all i did book the whole week
do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday
i was not myself i had lost a lot of thumb blood
i’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
you’re forgiven now if you want to stay get started on those beakers they’re still dirty from yesterday
next year i’m going to epcot
no i’m not mad at you i just wish you would have come to me so i didn’t have to hear it through the nerdvine
so what are we gonna do
you really want me to sign a prenup
i don’t know my dad’s pretty insistent on it though
why don’t i talk to your dad mantoman
really oh that’d be so great
i should probably give you a headsup about a couple of things even though he’s retired from the police force he still carries his gun but don’t worry he won’t shoot it it’s more of a fashion statement
and just to be safe when you talk to him don’t bring up jimmy carter gardeners foreign people homosexuals sean penn vatican ii gun control organic food the designated hitter rule recycling or the fact that you’re jewish
got it got it will you email me that list
so the thing to watch for if he’s shouting at you you’re okay but if he starts to get real quiet leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact not in a straight line throw some zigs and zigs in there
you know this isn’t that pressing why don’t i talk to him about it in may
in may you’re gonna be on the international space station
it was a nice retirement party
i guess still it’s a shame professor rothman was forced to step down
what choice did the university have he snapped it happens to theoretical physicists all the time
i wonder how long sheldon’s got
these shrimp are all the same size there’s no the logical order to eat them in
hey look there’s rothman’s empty office sad
what are you doing here kripke
ah measuwing my new office for dwapes
this is not your office it hasn’t been assigned yet
well i called dibs at the chwistmas party when pwofessor wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box
dibs this is a university not a playground offices are not assigned because someone called dibs
shut it offices are assigned by seniority i arrived at the university first
i awwived at the office first i’m the pwoverbial earwy bird
i’m glad that men are wearing hats again they’re so distinguished
i got you a little something
a little something oh it… what this is huge
what’s huge is what you’ve done for me
oh no amy i haven’t done anything
no no before i met you i was a mousy wallflower but look at me now i’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl with a posse a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front of all things open it open it
okay opens parcel to find a huge and not at all flattering painting of penny and amy
i wanted to get you something you didn’t have
wow ii don’t know what to s… wow
so uh where are you gonna hang it
oh my god hang it wow um you know i’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…
oh look you huh you just you got it all right there wow
i found him he’s in the bathroom president siebert
i’m sorry we just need a word
now you realize i’m your boss and i am holding my penis
sheldon give the man some pwivacy i’m sowwy this guy’s got no wespect for boundawies
will you tell this wunatic that pwofessor wothman’s office is wightfully mine
can’t you take this up with your department chairman
we tried his assistant said he was on sabbatical although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut
gentlemen there’s a task i’m trying to accomplish here and i’m having trouble doing it
oh my president siebert i don’t mean to be an alarmist but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia if you’re interested i can send you a link to a youtube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam yeah uh helpful hint trim your nails first
ignore him pwesident siebert i’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate
oh he’s just trying to butter you up and for the record butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam
gentlemen i’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because a you’re both brilliant scientists and b as far as who gets rothman’s office i couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind
well as wong as we’re here i might as well take a weak
so ugly what am i gonna do
i don’t know you can’t take it down you’ll break her heart look at that face that enormous unsettling crazy face
is there any chance i’ll learn to love it
that depends do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man
all right it’s got to go
how about i tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it
nuhuh what if she gets me one i already have a picture of me and howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in venice beach i’ve suffered enough
well i guess i could take it down and put it up when she comes over but it’s kind of heavy
mmm too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting
would you look at this i paid twenty five dollars to some kid on ebay for a handcrafted harry potter wand he sent me a stick he went into his backyard he picked up a stick
we’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen and if that doesn’t work i’m going to poison his tea
kripke come in i’m making tea would you like a cup
am i weawing a summer fwock no i don’t want tea wet’s get down to bwass tacks
fine in the interest of preserving our friendship…
well that’s a little hard to hear but all right as you know the essence of diplomacy is compromise with that in mind i propose the following i will take rothman’s office and you will find a way to be okay with that
how about i take wothman’s office and you go suck a wemon
you sure i can’t get you that cup of tea
how about you decide this with rockpaperscissorslizardspock
rockpaperscissorslizardspock was created by internet pioneer sam kass as an improvement on the classic game rockpaperscissors all hail sam kass
oh it’s very simple scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock crushes lizard lizard poisons spock spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard lizard eats paper paper disproves spock spock vaporizes rock and as it always has rock crushes scissors
i’m sowwy can you wepeat that
well of course scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock crushes lizard lizard poisons spock spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard lizard eats paper paper disproves spock spock vaporizes rock and as it always has rock crushes scissors
almost got it one more time
surely scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock…
sheldon stop he’s screwing with you
is he well then it seems we have reached an impasse i see no other option than to challenge you to a duel i’d smack you with a glove but just last week i packed away my winter things
it’s the 21st century you can’t have a duel
hhhhang on howard barry how good of a shot are you
not pistols minds a trivia contest and you may choose the field of battle star trek trivia star trek
you have a compwete advantage in twivia you have an eidetic memowy pwus i haven’t watched star twek since i discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet
it’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at
is there anything you’re both equally bad at
all right this is oneonone first person to five wins the office any questions yes sheldon
balls in the basket throws ball to sheldon
you know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us
hey he did that on purpose
no he didn’t nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose okay uh forget oneonone let’s try a free throw contest first person who makes a basket wins the office
making it too easy there hofstadter
use the force sheldon use the force throws ball it goes about two feet in front of him i’m gonna need more force
aw wight cooper pwepare to have your heart bwoken throws ball up it hits the ceiling and doesn’t come down do i get points for that
all right we gave it 45 minutes it’s no longer funny let’s try something else
uh on the count of three both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can the highest bounce wins the office
oh you are going down cooper
i don’t think so kripke i’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day
all right that’s enough trash talk one two three
i cannot believe you’ve never seen grease
my mother didn’t allow me to watch it she was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang
i’ve got to go i’ve got to get up early my company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles and the last one there has to do the measuring
i guess i should get going too good night painting penny good night real penny
you don’t have to say good night to painting amy ’cause she’s never leaving
ah okay let us take you off the wall out of sight out of mind i wish
you know can i borrow that movie those singing hooligans really got my motor running
sure sure enjoy i mean get it back to me when you can or you know what actually you keep it it’s just going to be my gift to you bye
thank you wait where’d the painting go
i have no idea that is weird
no no no it’s just it’s a little big
no come on you’re not an idiot look just help me put it back up
why so you can just take it down when i leave i don’t need your pity
i’m just glad i didn’t go for the sculpture
ah the spoils i see why victors love them
i’m happy for you sheldon but i have to admit i’m going to miss sharing an office with you
oh of course you are feel free to drop by any time
yeah call first pushes him out closes door rothman is standing naked behind it
professor rothman this isn’t your office any more you’re retired
i think the word you’re looking for is invisible
i came to say i’m sorry
i’m so humiliated i sat there the whole time that we were watching grease thinking you liked the painting
i was a fool from summer lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong
you’re right you’re absolutely right i should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much
yes too much because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical i clearly like you more than you like me
i don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another
i bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area there’s a number
if you don’t like feet you can try dollars the painting set me back three grand
three gr… oh my god look look amy all you need to know is you are my friend and i don’t want to lose you out of my life
i’m sorry i’m just having trouble believing you right now
okay look i didn’t want to say this but the real reason i took the painting down was because it made bernadette very jealous
oh my goodness how could i have not seen that the painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us she is the least cool
yeah ththththat’s what it is so…
you have such a good heart
we’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment
oh screw her she’s just lucky we let her hang out with us
i’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt
why don’t you just turn up the thermostat
aha good question it turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office no it’s next door in professor davenport’s office who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause
why is there a hole here
why is there a hole in my new office i’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities
well at least you finally got a window that opens that’s nice
what you don’t like wind chimes
no i hate them but it gets worse there it is
yeah it’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes
you don’t get it do you that’s a mockingbird mockingbirds can change their song which means he’s out of tune on purpose he’s mocking me oh dear there it is again do you feel it
the growing realization that you are one wacky bastard yep
no the vibration we are directly underneath the geology lab and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again hey gravel monkeys if you need to shake rocks try jiggling your heads around
how can i relax my nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the lowhanging scrotum of the difficulttoevict professor rothman
if you’re not happy why don’t you just let kripke have the office
what and let him win do i look crazy to you we’re trying to think down here you geodeloving feldspar jockeys to the bird and you the notes are c d e g and a you pick one or i am chopping down that tree
little more no that’s got it
yeah okay that’s uh that’s good
i’ll let you in on a little secret
originally we were painted nude but i had him add clothes ’cause i thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality
but if you ever change your mind all it would take is some warm soapy water and a couple of sponges
you’re talking about the painting right
i was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck
it’s called scientific curiosity now go get butter
hang in there i’ll be right back takes out phone and takes a photo sits down and starts posting it online
i’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things i’ll pick you up when you’re done
okay i like it a little better when you stay but all right
hello i’m here for my haircut with mr d’onofrio
i’m sorry uncle tony’s in the hospital he’s pretty sick
oh dear mr d’onofrio’s in the hospital why do these things always happen to me
i can cut it for you
you’re not mr d’onofrio i get my hair cut by mr d’onofrio you believe this guy
excuse us for a second sheldon it’s okay he can do it he’s a barber
he’s not a barber he’s the nephew he’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry besides mr d’onofrio knows exactly how i like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in texas
when i first moved here i was nervous about finding a new barber so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to mr d’onofrio
there’s no such thing as haircut records
no but my mother assured me they were sent here and i’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them uh excuse me do you have access to my haircut records
to paraphrase ts eliot this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with a nephew
sheldon you’re a grown man he’s a professional and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946 just sit down and let him do it
fine but if i come out of this looking like a dork it’s on you sits
so my kid said the funniest thing today
when you tell this story later the word we usually use is quirky
can you pass the parmesan cheese
i’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes
sheldon you are one day late for your haircut
thank you for captioning my nightmare
lookie here i got my travel orders
payload specialist howard wolowitz is requested to report to the nasa johnson space center houston texas for astronaut training monday eight am
yeah but it’s from nasa so it’s oh eight hundred
you read it as oh eight hundred
it doesn’t have an oh in front of it
you know what does have an oh in front of it oh my god i’m an astronaut and you’re dying of jealousy
so what kind of things are they… to sheldon will you stop that
i can’t help it i feel like a teen heartthrob
you know sheldon i used to cut my brother’s hair i could do it for you
penny i know you mean well offering the skills of the hill folk but um here in town we don’t churn our own butter we don’t uh make dresses out of gunny sacks and uh we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottleblonde…
i’m sorry it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair
you could go to my guy he’s at juanjuan in beverly hills they bring you a cup of tea they’ll massage your scalp it’s about two hundred dollars but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like tony danza
quick question here have we actually changed the conversation from i’m going
now who’s dying of jealousy oh it’s you
i’m a cowboy on a steel horse i ride i’m wanted… i’m wanted… wanted dead or alive sheldon you’re ruining girlfriendboyfriend singalong night
i’m sorry i’m looking for a barber and i’m running out of time my hair is growing at the rate of 46 yoctometers per femtosecond i mean if you’re quiet you can hear it
i tried once they do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time it’s like sodom and gomorrah with mousse
well this isn’t a crisis why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little
why don’t i let my hair grow out um why don’t i start wearing birkenstocks and uh uh seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it
well i don’t know i think you might look sexy with long hair the kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse bareback and barechested i’m gonna go brush my teeth it might take a while
i miss you too so tell me all about your first day
oh wow where do i even start i got to experience zero gravity
cool how do they do that
it’s pretty neat you get in this plane that goes almost straight up for like 20 seconds and then straight back down like it’s going to crash and they do it over and over again you know no matter how many times you throw up
yeah and the craziest part is because there’s no gravity the throwup kind of floats there in a little ball and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming sometimes it just floats right back in boy does everyone laugh at you when that happens
no yeah i would have laughed too but i didn’t want the vomit to come back out anyway oh could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear
i got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow and i have a hunch i packed a little light
mr d’onofrio it’s sheldon they didn’t have anything barberthemed in the gift shop so i got you this i don’t know if you can read his little tshirt it says um get well beary soon trust me if you were even a little conscious right now you’d be laughing anyway there’s new studies that show people in comas are aware of everything going on around them with that in mind if you can hear me move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors
yes do you have something i could use as a cape
oh dear did we spit out our pills slip out of the ninth floor and go on a little adventure
oh no no i’m just here to get my hair cut
ii see jjusjust wait here one moment security
i got to run but not with scissors that would be unsafe
so if i move my horsey here isn’t that checkmate and i win
well is it or isn’t it
you know i think this is a good stopping point uh it’s your first real game i threw a lot of information at you
well no i mean your king is trapped he can’t go here because of my lighthouse and he can’t go here because of my pointyhead guy
so did i win or not
did you have fun because if you had fun then you are you are a winner now that’s thatthat’s what chess is all about
oh hey sorry sheldon i’ll move
eh why my spot your spot what difference does it make
i don’t know between you playing chess like bobby fischer and sheldon being okay with you in his spot i’m guessing someone went back in time stepped on a bug and changed the course of human events
uh sweetie are you all right
no i’m not all right it’s been six days since i was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened
okay i’m sorry i don’t understand
i have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day but all my efforts our dinner schedule my pyjama rotation my bowel movement spreadsheet it’s clear now i’ve been wasting my time
good i’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge
you know shsheldon sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming i mean look at me and leonard we went out we broke up now we’re trying again we don’t know what’s gonna happen
oh please everyone knows what’s going to happen but i see your point
i think this could be good for you maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit
you’re right i should embrace the chaos
great what are you going to do first
i don’t know i could do anything all bets are off the world is my oyster i got it i’m going to put on my tuesday pyjamas tonight
i got to tell you i’m a little worried about him
if i were you i’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass
we did overnight survival training in the wilderness big fun big big fun i was gonna freshen up for you but i blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom
survival training is that like camping
uhhuh except you don’t have food or water and they don’t have a sunset sabbath service like they do at camp hesskramer
no i slept in a hole i dug in the ground with my bare hands and at some point during the night an armadillo crawled in and spooned me
but i did it i survived i wasn’t sure i was going to when the sandstorm hit i just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death but somehow as i sat there wrapped in a cocoon of my own necksweat i found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living no matter what the cost
you’re so brave i’m proud of you
i ate a butterfly it was so small and beautiful but i was so hungry
no i don’t think it’s possible i’m severely dehydrated my pee is like toothpaste
howie if you’re not able to do this come home it won’t change how i feel about you
thanks honey but i can’t quit if i do i’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up
well is there anything i could do to help
don’t let this be sheldon playing bongos please don’t let this be sheldon playing bongos
hello leonard do you like my bongos bet you didn’t know that i had bongos
sheldon it’s three o’clock in the morning
three in the morning is a good time for bongos
leonard sleeps while i play bongos
leonard no sleep while i play bongos bongo solo
stop stop it stop stop stop it
oh hi penny guess what sheldon got bongos
richard feynman played the bongos i thought i’d give that a try
richard feynman was a famous physicist
oh leonard it’s three o’clock in the morning i don’t care if richard feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt
penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun penny forgot to use the subjunctive
sheldon go to bed you have work in the morning
maybe maybe not maybe tomorrow i start a bongo band and tour the world
wwwuh no no hang onuh uh roommate agreement no hootenannies singalongs or barbershop quartets after ten pm
roommate agreement are you kidding we are living in a world of chaos roommate agreement
wherever the music takes me kitten i play bongos walking down the stairs sound of falling oh oh never play bongos walking down the stairs
i’m here to help you get through this you can’t do it on your own you need someone to take care of you
oh i love you so much
howard your bath is getting cold
don’t worry once she falls asleep i’ll spoon you like an armadillo
he showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos i foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call
poor guy he must have been exhausted sheldon like to sleep while leonard play the bongo
that was kind of uncalled for
all right sheldon this craziness has gone on long enough please come home so i can cut your hair
penny you’re not trained you’re not licensed most importantly you don’t have access to my haircut records
all right honey look we’ve known each other for a long time now right i’ve taken you to disneyland i kicked a bully in the nuts for you i sing you soft kitty when you’re sick you’ve even saw me naked once
it was a long story anyway sheldon i promise i know what i’m doing please let me cut your hair
there’s not a hair on my body i wouldn’t let this woman trim
fine let’s go thank you for letting me sleep on your couch
there’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed
what’s this about sheldon seeing you naked
oh relax it was just her bottom and her breasts
at the end of the haircut mr d’onofrio would tell me a dirty joke
well sorry i don’t know any dirty jokes
that’s okay i never understood them anyway
hmm well it’s a little hollywood but i think i can pull it off well done penny
ha told you okay i’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go
fun time hah sorry sometimes the clippers tickle me
okay sheldon laughs and jerks penny accidentally shaves a strip up the back of his head okay yep we’re all done now it’s just it’s good let me just take that away from you okay
you are welcome yeah i’m gonna have to move
hey want to spend some time playing the new star wars game this weekend
oh i don’t know i kind of promised myself i’d get off the computer be more physically active get some exercise
you’re about to walk up three flights of stairs
you know what would be great let’s do it like the old days
you mean are you talking gaming marathon
yeah start saturday morning go 48 hours sleeping bags junk food
turn off our phones so our moms can’t call
it would be like our world of warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us
they called the cops because of the smell they thought we were dead
we were badass back in the day
48 hours of star wars gaming
hey sheldon clear your weekend starting saturday morning star wars marathon
movies or video games or board game or trading card games or lego’s or dress up or comic books or dramatic readings of novelizations yes to all
we are going to play the online game
gentlemen as much as i’m sure sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic makebelieve he and i have other plans we are attending my aunt flora’s 93rd birthday party
just tell her i can’t come
she’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up
she’s 93 she won’t be disappointed for very long
no hang on i followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement i made a written record request 72 hours in advance i checked the tyre pressure on the car i even contacted the centres for disease control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to orange county fyi it’s none
amy the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way
you use it to get your way
i use it to get the right way the fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence
you gave me your word you’re coming with me
yeah well who wants to spend the whole weekend running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters that’s for babies
yeah please amy it’s got lightsabres
hey sheldon help you with anything
yes i’m attending a party this weekend for a 93yearold woman can you recommend a gift
uh i don’t know could put a tennis ball on the end of excalibur make a pretty badass cane
do you supply the the tennis ball
hmm oh have this collectors edition batman utility belt maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy
well she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume
i’m sorry sheldon that’s it that’s all i got
oh it’s not your fault i’ve been to the model train store i’ve been to radio shack this woman is impossible to shop for
i’d make fun of sheldon for having girl problems if i wasn’t in shock that sheldon has girl problems
no leonard go ahead and mock like my daddy always said shelly women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom
that’s what your father used to say
well i took out the bad words and the yeehaw but you get the gist
look if you don’t want to go to the party just don’t go you’re a grown man act like one tell amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends maybe she’ll dig it women like a firm hand on the tiller
i can never find the tiller i got a book it didn’t help
yeah i always thought if i were ever enslaved it would be by an advanced species from another planet not some hotsytotsy from glendale
now i downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation phone makes whip sound
you’re right i’m smart as a whip i should be able to figure this out
hey listen i kind of made plans with the guys this weekend but then i wondered because we’re in this relationshipbetatest if i should have asked you first then i thought if i did check with you first you’d think that i was taking things to seriously and then then i got a nosebleed
you don’t have to check with me do whatever you want
oh i guess i was hoping for a different reaction but okay
really what were you hoping for
i don’t know maybe that you’d be a little upset and then you’d realize that i’m a stallion that has to run free and that would turn you on a little
okay i’m an actress ask me again
do you mind if i spend the weekend playing video games with the guys
whu… the entire weekend you mean i wouldn’t see you at all but i ju… no no i knew what i was getting into you can’t put a saddle on leonard hofstadter oh my is it getting hot in here ay papi
oh so you chose that when you become turned on you turn into speedy gonzalez
choo got a problem with that papi
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
sorry stallion your weird friend giraffe is here
hello penny i just stopped by to bring you this gift
now that you’re in my debt please manipulate amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party
all right i thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante these are cooper coupons these are for various things i can do for you um oh this one is for one free grammar check uh you could use it for emails letters tattoos what have you um oh this is fun one this is an afternoon with me at the california science center where i point out their mistakes
keep an eye on those expiration dates i’ve been burned more than once
all right sweetie i’m not going to get involved in your relationship
oh come on it’s just a simple favour now when’s the last time i asked you to do something for me
yesterday you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it
when is the last time i asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency
yesterday you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it
all right then i have no choice but to go on to plan b
i’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold
i think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today not only do you get to meet my relatives but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party all of the food is incredibly soft it’s like a vacation for your teeth
you sure you’re okay with this
yes i decided to find a way that i could have this experience and enjoy it
thank you that means a lot to me
oh don’t thank me thank wireless technology i realized i can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends
sheldon my relatives are going to want to talk to you and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game isn’t that a little rude
oh i got that covered headset i won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying
you know if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after i’ve already told everybody i’ll be bringing somebody then fine go home and play your game
thanks ooh listen i wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry
here you go i’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game low fat turkey jerky lowcarb beer 100calorie snack packs
you pick up a y chromosome while you were there you might be short one
hey i plan on levelling up in the game not my swimsuit size thank you very much
gentlemen the game offers us a choice between playing for the republic and the light side or the sith empire and the dark side
well we’re always the good guys in dd we’re lawful good in city of heroes we’re the heroes in grand theft auto we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat
those women are prostitutes you said they were raising money for stem cell research
hey guys i got a surprise
uh if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop i think raj beat you to it
no bernadette’s going to be playing with us so that’s pretty cool huh right sure it is yeah
what you invited your girlfriend this is supposed to be our weekend
i had no choice last night she said why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the arboretum and i said well no i promised the guys i was going to play a video game with them all weekend and she said that sounds like fun can i come too and then i didn’t answer for a second and then she said well do you not want me to come and then i bought her a new laptop and the game and she’s parking the car right now
is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here
uh it is but i think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny whip sound i was wrong it’s still funny
well i know he didn’t cheat on you so what happened
i had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself and everybody was like where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about is he real or did you make him up like armin the miniature horse breeder
who’s armin the miniature horse breeder
the pretend boyfriend i invented to get my family off my back it unravelled quickly when i couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet
i would have thought at a miniature horse show
i panicked and said woodstock i just wanted to show sheldon off to my family
sure i get that i mean he’s your first boyfriend and all
not just my first boyfriend he’s the best boyfriend i mean think about it i’m dating sheldon cooper
he’s handsome he’s lanky he’s brilliant and his skin has that pale waxy quality
well sickly is the new sexy
mm you know amy sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about the sucky part is it leaves you open to getting hurt
do you ever worry about leonard doing that to you
get that guy get that guy pew pew pew pew
dr rostenkowski it may interest you to know that saying pew pew pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key in the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go
raj imperial troopers on your tail
got him when gandhi advocated his philosophy of nonviolence i bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff
all right i think we got them all let’s divide up the loot
ooh look at this pretty purple robe i just got you should put on yours and then we’ll match
but i worked hard to get this armour
sorry i just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple
i don’t think i want to play a game
oh come on they’re playing one across the hall we should too okay we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table and if it goes into this cup the other person has to drink then you get to go again…
wow yeah bbeginner’s luck so now i will drink this entire cup of beer and you will go again and we can… uh… all right so yeah okay now i’m gonna drink this entire cup and then i’m going to drink another one… okay seriously stop what the hell
spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends at a certain point you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting
whoa whoa give me a second to catch up here hold on sound of cheering
that’d be my boyfriend happier playing his dopey star trek game with his friends than hanging out with me
star wars they get all cranky when you mix the two up
how do i get him to treat me better
all right let me give you a little girlfriend 101 usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex but that will work better after sheldon hits puberty so i’d say give him the silent treatment
our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is sixanda half hours he said it was a magical evening
all right then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie making a scene
i don’t think i’d be good at that
that’s why you’re lucky to have me back in omaha there are two different restaurants i’m not allowed into both chili’s
bernadette remember your character’s the healer in our group you’re in charge of healing all of us not just howard
i can’t help it my howie wowie has an owie
that is the most sickeningly sweet thing i have ever experienced and i am sipping koolaid through a red vine
sheldon cooper i’ve got a bone to pick with you and i’m about to do it in front of all your friends
yeah you pick that bone you pick that bone clean
i’m gonna publicly shame you and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour
and if you don’t start treating me better i’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named armin
sheldon she wanted to show you off to her family and you stood her up okay look at this adorable smushy face smush smush smush smush
i think i understand you’re the one person who can say sheldon cooper is your boyfriend but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh i forget what i bring to the party and what i take away when i leave please accept these valuable cooper coupons as restitution
sheldon she doesn’t want your stupid…
ooh science center redeeming let’s go
well played amy farrah fowler let me get my coat whip sound oh grow up leonard
but eexcuse me i have something to say none of you may realize it but i was very much looking forward to this weekend it was gonna be like the old days the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend even if i get one someday i’ll still be the guy who got a girl after sheldon cooper
and that’s how a girl makes a scene i’m sorry sweetie you’re right you deserve your weekend come on amy let’s go
i’ll let you hold my hair while i throw up
just leave okay now this is the way it’s supposed to be men together fighting the forces of evil
i can’t believe this is only 64 calories
howard joel wolowitz i’ve been worried sick for two days and i know you turned off your phone you open up this door right now because i’ve had it up to here i have been to the morgue and the hospital and i spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs
that’s my ride got to go whip sound
oh my god i love this chicken
oh you know what they say the best things in life are free
okay you’re right i eat your food a lot how about this you can raid my fridge any time you want
oh that’s very kind of you next time i have a hankering to wash down a d cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice i’ll come aknocking
hey raj you didn’t send your rsvp in i’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding
well can you make it soon there’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts in one corner bernadette’s mom and the other three mine
yeah i hate wedding receptions i wish the bride and groom would take a cue from bilbo baggins slip on the ring disappear and everyone goes home
mmm you liked professor guyster’s wedding
they had a make your own sundae bar ooh that was a night to remember do you know on the one trip i just had a bowl of nuts
anyway you gotta let me know if you have a plus one because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck
alright uh fine i’m coming and i’m bringing somebody uh koothrappali plus one
he’s bringing me who are you bringing
wow what a bunch of nosey o’donnells
i’m not telling i’m from asia i’m mysterious deal with it
howard are you having a make your own sundae bar
no uh i don’t think so
well you should 50 of marriages end in divorce but 100 of make your own sundae bars end in happiness
hello mummy daddy how are you
oh i’m sure you can just give it a minute
listen uh there’s something i want to talk to you about i i wasn’t ready until now but i think it’s time
it’s finally happening you’re coming out of the closet aren’t you
we love you and we accept your alternate lifestyle just keep it to yourself
no i’m not gay if anything i’m metrosexual
it means i like women as well as their skincare products
well if you’re not coming out why did you call us during the cricket semifinals
‘cause i i’m tired of trying to meet someone and i think i’d like you to help me find uh a wife
and just to clarify a female wife
matchmaking very smart move son much better than marrying for love
quantum physics makes me so happy
it’s like looking at the universe naked shivers
hi you guys got a minute
well i was thinking about sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food
oh that was no joke but i understand your confusion as i am our group’s resident cutup
i’m sorry you are our resident cutup
anyway i got a little residual cheque from my commercial and i thought hey how about i get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back so sheldon tada
ah a vintage mint in box 1975 mego star trek transporter with real transporter action hotdarn
uh from stuart at the comicbook store
you went to the comicbook store by yourself
yeah it was fun i walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks felt pretty good
well this calls for an expression of gratitude
ooh am i about to get a rare sheldon cooper hug
not this time then they wouldn’t be special thanks penny
you’re welcome don’t worry i didn’t forget about you leonard i got you a label maker
wow no it’s great also uh mint in box
mmm and i got you a transporter too
look it was actually designed for my vintage mr spock action figure
oh that’s great let’s open it up and put him in there
c’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
once you open the box it loses its value
yeah yeah my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity gotta tell you it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it
are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman
oh yes in my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date plus i want to make a good impression and no offence but with you guys here i look like six two
the nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school they used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit
hindus do the same thing except they leave room for a cow
listen i love your charming racist humour but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here
yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox
it’s different you’re people don’t worship lox
well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins
so arranged marriages the parents just decide and then you have to get married
oh no no i get a say in it but i’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome i’ve been having with aunt jemima and mrs butterworth
oh yes you must be lakshmi uh nice to meet you
oh uh these are my my friends this is bernadette
please have a seat to bernadette i’m thinking double wedding
i need to speak with you
fascinating the only logical explanation is that this is a dream
it is not the only logical explanation for example you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by say a coconut
was i hit on the head by a coconut
i’m not going to dignify that with a response now to the matter at hand you need to play with the transporter toy
yes and to open it would destroy it’s value but remember like me you also have a human half
well i’m not going to dignify that with a response
consider this what is the purpose of a toy
therefore to not play with it would be
illogical oh damn it spock you’re right i’ll do it
sheldon wait you have to wake up first
oh of course set phasers to dumb right wakes up in bed goody goody goody this is wrong this is wrong i’m so excited but this is wrong i’m gonna do it i’m doing it i did it oh that’s what i always thought 1975 smelled like one to beam down mr scott aye aye mr spock energise spins toy energise tries to spin toy it sticks tries to get spock out and toy falls apart don’t be broken please don’t be broken to spock toy what did you make me do okay okay think sees leonard’s toy it’s only logical
well i hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake
impressive what goes into making something like that
well you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle and when it falls you panic quickly change the name and voila lava cake
i bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here
well let’s see yup three missed calls
four missed calls two text messages and a failed video chat i win so what are we going to tell them
i’d like to tell them things are going well
me too but before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page
okay what page are you on
i’m on the one where i’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down and have a family and i’m going to do it so they don’t find out i’m gay
like dude on dude but with women
i know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture
well there is a rumour back in new delhi that you’re how shall we say comfortable in a sari
really the chocolate lava cake the little soaps in the bathroom and i’m sorry but you’re wearing more perfume than i am
that’s unbreakable by khloe and lamar and for your information it’s unisex
fill in the blank i love the nightlife
wwwith women i like to boogie with women
that’s disappointing you were exactly the kind of phoneybaloney husband i was looking for
thankyou and once again my baloney likes girls waitwait you don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream yeah okay that time i heard it
oh dear two suns and no sunscreen
what is it now tiny spock
i am very disappointed in you you broke your toy and switched it with leonard’s you should be ashamed of yourself
you’re the one who told me to play with it
if i told you to jump off the bridge of the enterprise would you do it
no if i got on the bridge of the enterprise i would never ever leave
trust me it gets old after a while you must right your wrong sheldon
why i got away with it leonard has his toy and he’s never going to open it so he won’t know it’s broken and i have a toy that isn’t broken everybody’s happy
i thought where you come from they don’t have emotions
i come from a factory in taiwan now do the right thing
you know what you are well you’re a green blooded buzzkill perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here
fine i will just use the transporter oh right you broke it
very well cooper to enterprise one to beam up energise throws spock away get’s attacked by a gorn wakes up ah tiny spock help
yep one sec puts thing in mouth ah good ma would have killed me if she’d found out i’d broke my retainer
hey uh can i run something by you it’s about lakshmi
yeah sure how are things going
we hit a couple of bumps she lives over on manhattan beach so it takes over an hour to get there and she’s a lesbian
what do you mean she’s a lesbian
well you know whenever you and i would try to hit on women in bars and they’d blow us off and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay it’s like that except this time it’s true
then why did she even go out with you
she was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight and you know it sounded crazy to me at first but i’m actually thinking about doing it
okay well so the reason that might sound crazy is ’cause it’s crazy
look howard you’re in a relationship you know you have to make compromises
well yes but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy or whose turn it is to do the laundry bernadette’s or my mom’s
it’s a great deal we both get our parents off our backs i don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night plus once i’m married i can finally eat carbs again and let myself go
why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else you know maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you
because this one wants to marry me i might never find another one who does
so you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with
i can’t believe your attitude i thought you were in favour of gay people getting married
do you hear how homophobic you sound
oh i don’t want a broken toy switches them back again penny and leonard enter nothing
really i don’t even notice any more
i cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these
well i told you you don’t it’s mint in box
i dunno i just think it’s a waste picks up box sheldon screams relax i’m just looking at the box
perhaps you should look with your eyes and not your muscular nebraska manhands
my problem is that i don’t want you to break leonard’s toy which you probably did by shaking it she shook it we all saw her
leonard i bought you this because i wanted you to have fun with it i don’t want it to just sit in this box
you know you’re right i mean it’s from you i’m never going to sell it i’m opening it
i didn’t break it i i guess stuart sold it to me like this
yes yes he did that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation yeah let’s all be mad at stuart
you know i paid a lot for this let’s take it over there and show him
wait it was me i opened your toy discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you
i didn’t that was a lie i opened my own toy and it was already broken so i switched them
well you should talk to stuart
i can’t because that was a lie yours was broken in an earthquake and that’s a lie
my mr spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it and when the toy broke i switched it for yours later he encouraged me to do the right thing and i defied him and then i was attacked by a gorn
leonard penny i just i want you both to know that i regret my actions toward the two of you that’s a lie
well hand it over so i can open it
okay leonard even though i don’t have one any more i hope you have fun playing with it
big fat whopper i hope it breaks
this is a treat what brings you guys by
raj howie told me what’s going on with you and lakshmi
we believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you
well actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman
so while i’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match who may or may not exist i’m supposed to just be alone
not necessarily i think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with pulls a puppy out of her bag
oh my goodness aren’t you the cutest little yorkie ever you got him for me
her we thought you two would hit it off
i think we already have thank you guys so much let’s see if you fit in my man purse
so i got the craziest email this morning
i don’t mean to burst your bubble dude but those penile enlargement pills do not work
believe me i know the email i got was from the office of stephen hawking
he’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair
that’s amazing you’ll be like his pit crew a word of caution i would not do your stephen hawking impression in front of him
you’re right i suppose that could be considered offensive
oh boy sheldon’s going to freak out
i was actually thinking about bringing him along when i go over there so he can meet the great man
that’s really nice of you howard
boy a restraining order from stephen hawking it’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from leonard nimoy carl sagan and stan lee
leonard do you recall when i said that i was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the higgs boson particle and you said sheldon it’s two am get out of my bedroom
like it was ten hours ago what about it
well i believe i’ve done it and i’m only saying believe to sound modest because sweet sam houston i did it
that’s incredible oh here break out the math
oh okay let me see this all right so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time now i was thinking… howard you go ahead and eat this isn’t going to make any sense to you
sheldon i have a working understanding of physics
yeah good for you and don’t stop working on it
are you still going to tell him about youknowwho
please please please let me meet hawking
no you said would it help if i said i’m sorry
and you never answered me so who owes whom an apology now
sheldon you’re a condescending jerk why on earth would i want to do something nice for you
um to go to jewish heaven
have you met my mother i live in jewish hell
howard please this is stephen hawking perhaps my only intellectual equal
try to put yourself in my place imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs and then it turns out there’s another human being
hang on are you saying the rest of us are dogs
yeah okay i can see you’re going to take this the wrong way let me try again imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps
oh now they’re so much smarter than dogs have you seen them on those little bicycles
so come on how was the first day with hawking
it was great we talked about movies
i showed him some card tricks
he even let me read a couple pages from his new book
something got you down there bunky
raj you’re our group historian has sheldon ever begged before
three times he begged the fox network not to cancel firefly he begged the tnt network to cancel babylon 5 and when he got food poisoning at the rose bowl parade he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly
do you understand how important hawking is to me when i was six years old i dressed up as him for halloween
no sir no i took my dad’s desk chair attached a speak  spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat granted most people thought i was r2d2 but still i got a lot of candy
you don’t seem to be understanding the english word no maybe a different language will help russian nyet chinese bu japanese iie klingon qo binary coded ascii 0110111001101111
i’m not asking for me i’m asking for hawking
let me try gansta hells no
okay look how about this just give him my paper on the higgs boson if he sees the incredible breakthrough i’ve made he’ll reach out to me
that’s an interesting idea why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends
you do realize you own his ass right now
you can make him do anything you want
yeah i know i’m just trying to figure out how much i want to punish him
hey fellas i’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some
bring him to his bony knees
yes yes what did you decide
i’ll give your paper to professor hawking
great thank you oh that’s terrific
but in exchange i’d like you to do a few things for me
are you familiar with the 12 labours of hercules
all right what would you like me to do first
well i thought i’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles
oh by all means when i was a boy i would polish my meemaw’s silver and she would entertain me with stories about growing up in oklahoma interesting woman you know she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat
that’s a lot of belt buckles
funny thing is i only have one belt anyway i’ll let you get started oh by the way the little marks uh that look like water spots i tend to stand too close to the urinal so what you’re seeing there is splash back
you make sissy on your belt buckles meemaw’s forks never had that
here is a black light to check them and for your own peace of mind you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room
sheldon these look great they’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels how’d you get them so shiny
oh ii buffed them with turtle wax the man down at pep boys says from now on the urine should just bead up and roll right off
way to go the extra mile your meemaw would be proud
my meemaw must never know of this now will you give professor hawking my paper
oh my dear boy no okay next this is a sexy french maid costume i bought for bernadette i thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time but i was wrong and really wrong
and you want me to return it for you
no no no mon petit cherie
what are you all staring at didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with stephen hawking before
it’s not saturday night why are you doing your laundry
wow are these amy’s kind of trashy good for her
ugh why are you washing howard’s man panties
because if i don’t he won’t give my paper to stephen hawking he’s a famous physicist
yeah yeah i know he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time
i don’t understand why doesn’t howard just introduce you to the guy
because he’s punishing me for being a quote condescending jerk you don’t think i’m condescending do you
i know what it means and yes you love correcting people and putting them down
au contraire when i correct people i am raising them up you should know i do it for you more than anyone
come on you do it to feel superior i see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet
or don quixote is a book about a donkey named hotay
see there it is there’s that twinkle
well i can’t help it that’s an involuntary twinkle
what do you want me to tell you sheldon
i want you to tell me that howard is being mean to me for no reason
fine howard is being mean to you for no reason
every time i spend the night your mom slaps me on the behind and says go get ‘im
it’s not her fault she’s getting hormone replacement therapy makes her crazy horny check this out i got sheldon to wear the french maid’s costume
hey i gave you first crack at it
why are you doing that you’re being mean to him
he’s mean to me all the time you’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate
if you don’t want to get teased about that get a doctorate i have one they’re great
oh come on the man torments me i’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine
it’s not the same thing sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain
fine i’ll just make him do a couple more things then i’ll stop
no you have to stop now
bernadette i want to remind you you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow
oh damn i’m sorry i can’t make it but sheldon’s going to go with you and that’s the last thing you do to him
what is it now mrs wolowitz
it’s this dress when i put my front in my back pops out when i put my back in my front pops out it’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub
what do you want me to do
we’re gonna have to work as a team get in here grab a handful and start stuffing
i’m not sure how to do this
it’s easy just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag
sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much but okay
oh if we squeeze you any tighter you may turn into a diamond
you’re right who am i kidding you should have seen me when i was young sheldon the fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy why did i eat it all would you hold me
oh no you know i’m not really the holding kind of… oh
oh guys i just remembered i got you some hawking souvenirs
gears and springs from his wheelchair pretty cool huh
yeah i made an adjustment on the motor drive and when i was putting it back together i could not for the life of me figure out where they went
i did it had to go to three clothing stores but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother
i should have sent you to the custom car cover place in altadena they have her pattern on file
humorous now will you please present my paper to professor hawking
oh for heaven’s sake i did your laundry i peepeeproofed your belt buckles i i even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom
all right sheldon there’s only one thing left i want you to do don’t worry it’s an easy one
fine you have very tiny hands
no about my job i want you to tell me i’m good at what i do
you’re obviously good at what you do
well then why are you always ripping on me
oh i understand the confusion i have never said that you are not good at what you do it’s just that what you do is not worth doing
it’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me i’d take it and run
now will you give my paper to hawking
i gave it to him three days ago he was really impressed he wants to meet you
all right then thank you howard please let professor hawking know that i’m available at his earliest convenience
i thought he might be a little more excited
give it a second sound of sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom
professor hawking it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you sir
i want to thank you for taking time to see me
my pleasure i enjoyed reading your paper very much you clearly have a brilliant mind
your thesis that the higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating
thank you it just it came to me one morning in the shower
that’s nice too bad it’s wrong
you made an arithmetic mistake on page two it was quite the boner
no no ththththat can’t be right ii don’t make arithmetic mistakes
oh no no no of course not it’s just i was thinking… oh gosh golly i made a booboo and i gave it to stephen hawking
i wish you could all be inside my head the conversation is sparkling pause fine i’ll tell you a lichen is an organism made up of two separate species fungi and algae if you could merge with another species what species would you pick and why hint there is a right answer none of you will get it
okay uh i’d pick swan because uh the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck i’ve always dreamed of having
horse but mostly just for the height a little bit for the genital girth
wrong and let’s keep it clean shall we
kangaroo uh i’d be a kangajew the first of my people to dunk a basketball
also instead of just living in your mother’s house you could actually live inside her body
clever but also wrong no the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself that way you’d be human fungus and algae triple threat like threebean salad
give me one circumstance in which that would be useful
all right picture this a beautiful outdoor concert now as a human i appreciate beethoven as a fungus i have a terrific view growing out of a towering maple tree and no thank you expensive concessions because as an algae i’ll just snack on this sunlight
anyway if it’s okay with you we should talk about howard’s bachelor party
well seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation but what do you know you’re half swan
i’ve been doing some research on strippers one agency i spoke to said i could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs
sounds like loads of fun but i promised bernadette no strippers
you don’t want strippers you’re the king of strippers the one club in north hollywood named a pole after you
what can i tell ya i’m not into that stuff any more
good for you howard i’m proud of you and still you’re the first one of us to get married we have to do something special
you know germans have an interesting prewedding custom
well it’s probably not for me
maybe we can go up to napa valley they’ve got that wine train
boo wine but yay trains i’m in
anyway it’s a beautiful time of year uh you travel through the vineyards there’s a tasting on board and all the wild flowers are in bloom it’s magic
look at that in 30 seconds we went from hiring women to being them
so i hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight
yeah just going to a restaurant get some steaks and scotch nothing to worry about
well i don’t know it’s a bachelor party there could be strippers wouldn’t that make you a little jealous
oh come on leonard it’s you what’s going to happen i mean even if there was a stripper all you’d do is avoid eyecontact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework
hey i am a young man in his sexual prime under the right conditions iii am capable of just really crazy stuff
really what is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman and the time you and i had sex in the ocean does not count
oh come on that’s got to count there was a really strong undertow we could have died
oh i will there is no telling what might happen
you know there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their sat’s
hey i got to hand it to raj he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party
it’s not bad unless you compare it to a train then it stinks
indeed if i’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night then i must embrace all its components including tobacco swear words and yes alcohol jeepers that’s yucky
whoa it’s a little early to start dropping jbombs don’t you think
oh hey wil nice of you to make it out tonight for howard
well it was either this or another hot tub party at george takei’s house
i’m confused i thought since our reconciliation i was your friend in this group
oh i’m friends with howard too
oh i guess you’re just friends with anybody drinks aagh
hey uh leonard things are a little tight at the comic book store i might need some help covering my share of the check
and maybe a few bucks for the valet
and gas money to get home
great you know what this is my grandfather’s watch
18carat gold got it in europe during the war
mmhmm a hundred bucks and it’s yours
hey everybody the bachelor boy has arrived for he’s a jolly good fellow…
for he’s a jolly good fellow for he’s a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny
yes yes yes he’s a jowwy good fewwow what time do the stwippers awwive
actually barry we’re not going to have strippers tonight
ah then what the fwig did i get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for
you want to buy a watch
this is maid of honour amy farrah fowler bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day let’s check in with a beautiful radiant young woman and her friend who’s about to get married ladies can you tell us what you’re doing
um these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our outoftown guests this is a map of pasadena this is a list of local restaurants and then for howie’s relatives we have antihistamines antacids and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation
yeah we labeled them stop and go
all right pivoting to the big question bernadette on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage what do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife
keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage
hey they may conceive a child on their wedding night don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened
i don’t care ask her things like are you going to take howard’s name not who’s going to sit on who
i’ve actually been thinking i’m going to hyphenate
nice you know you should totally get bernadettemaryannrostenkowskiwolowitzcom before someone snaps it up
howard already took care of it plus he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories do you know for a while in poland my family and his family were neighbours
no it’s not i’ll explain it to you later
may i have your attention please we are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend howard wolowitz
and apparently wil wheaton’s best friend
does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening
yeah i do all groan as is the tradition i have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at howard’s expense prepare to have your ribs tickled howard i always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married because you are so short and unappealing am i right let’s see here oh seriously though howard you’re actually one of the most intelligent people i know and that’s a zinger because you’re not i’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday assuming you’d be able to get the parts and develop the engineering skills to assemble them which i don’t see as likely hacha okay let me see here okay kidding aside howard you are a good friend and i wish you nothing but happiness bazinga i don’t
doubleazinga i do good luck following that
so howard wolowitz tying the knot leaving his crazy bachelor days behind he was a wild one well i guess we all kind of were i remember this one time i was with this girl at the beach we were in the ocean and we started making out i know it was crazy i wasn’t even wearing my aquasocks then…
nobody cares hofstadter wwap it up
i totally had sex in the ocean
okay i’ll go howard when i think about you and bernadette starting this wonderful life together i can’t help but get a little choked up i mean look at you you have everything look at me i’m 37 i sleep in the back of a comic book store and i have the bone density of an 80yearold man to howard
yeah to howard um uh who’s next
i’ll go howard i’m gonna say something to you that evewybody’s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud when you invite a man to a bachewor pawty the impwication is there will be stwippews maybe not compwetewy nude but at weast pasties and gstwings that’s not unweasonable
okay uh anybody else huh no okay it all comes down to me the best man ooh this grasshopper is kicking my asshopper okay when i first came to this country ii didn’t know how to behave or how to dress or what was cool i was pretty lonely but then i met howard and suddenly my life changed because we could be lonely together this man became my whole world
yeah nice speech fwancine tucks a dollar in raj’s pants
i’m not done but thank you raj puts the dollar on the table stuart steals it i think back to all the good times we had like uh when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets i told him i’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin
and the first woman you ever disappointed sexually badabazinga
oh oh yeah and then there was the time when leonard and i took howard to las vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle of all the howard humping hookers stories that one’s my favourite
okay buddy that’s it sit down
oh oh what about that tubby girl in the sailor moon costume at comiccon
the only threesome i’ve ever had in my life and i’m proud to say it was with this man right here
oh oh don’t get me wrong nothing happened with me and howard there was about 200 pounds of sailor moon between us
oh internet this is so going all over you
thank you for picking us up there’s a warning right there on the scotch bottle you cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this laddie
funny you boys have a nice time
yeah it was great and lowkey like i promised no hankypanky no strippers just the guys telling jokes
how about you did you have a fun night yeah we uh made gift bags had wine and then went online and saw this
you know we’re not that far from my apartment if you stop the car i can walk from here
you lied to me you said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with but you never mentioned your cousin the prostitute or raj
seriously you don’t even have to stop the car anything under ten miles an hour and i can combatroll into the street
okay just to set the record straight i didn’t hire the prostitute she was a gift from him shame on you raj that is not how we treat women in this country
don’t you try and blame this on him
i don’t know what i’m going to do i’m supposed to marry howard in a couple of weeks and i’m not sure i even know who the man is any more
i’m curious what’s bothering you most the borderline incest the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon
amy remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t
when i first met howard he seemed so innocent to me just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother
well if that’s what you like i’ll take you to the comic book store the place is full of ’em
wait a minute you set me up with howard did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into
well a little you hear stuff
well i was gonna but i didn’t think it would go past the first date then when it did i thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother definitely not past the two of you sleeping together i mean the warning signs were there this is really on you
my god i thought you were my friend runs to bedroom
i don’t think that was helpful
hi bernie it’s me again please call me back
it’s not your fault it’s mine i did all that stuff not you
actually you did do one of them together
you’re upset the convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage
chicken broth it seemed culturally appropriate also there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when i moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years so as they say two birds
i don’t know what my next move is
well howard i don’t know much about women
no uh that that’s it i don’t know much about women raj you got anything
i’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from comiccon
i’m not calling the girl from comiccon
all right more sailor moon for me
i just threw up the bachelor party
please come out bernadette let’s talk through this
perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine do you have a cousin who you find attractive
hey you introduced him to the sleazebag i’m just trying to clean up your mess
i need to talk to bernadette
well i don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now
all right well could you at least give her a message
tell her i’m really sorry and if she doesn’t want to marry me i get it but what i really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by is the guy that i’m disgusted by too but that guy doesn’t exist any more he’s gone and the reason is because of her so if this relationship is over let her know that she made me a better man and tell her thank you
oh my god howard that’s the most beautiful thing i’ve ever heard and it came out of you
penny has a message for you
i heard your voice not unlike your mother’s travels through walls
do you want me to go
no come here i’m still really mad at you
is there anything else about your past i should know
couple things but you know most of them happened overseas i’ll tell you later
so is the wedding still on
yeah the wedding’s still on they hug
oh thank god i’m still a maid of honour joins in the hug
oh what the hell joins in too
i’m gonna have sex with you right here right now on that washing machine
if you want to do something you can help me fold this sheet
folding a sheet in my underwear still pretty crazy
hey howard dave roeger here at nasa we need to talk about your upcoming mission
yes yes i’ve been doing my pushups i’m still stuck at nine but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me
you’re kidding so what does that mean uhhuh uhhuh boy i got to tell you i’m really disappointed this was my dream ever since i was a little kid okay well uh thanks for the call yep you too puts down phone yes thank you oh oh i’m not gonna die in space i’m gonna die the way god intended in my late 50s with a heart full of pastrami
i’m going to need a larger shirt this one’s a little tight under the arms
do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear
yes of course that’s why it’s tight
all right let me rephrase the question why are you wearing long underwear
you’re kidding shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you
leonard these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers i don’t like my own sweat touching my skin how do you think i feel about theirs
why don’t you slip this on
said the hangman offering a noose
well that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes but it was right up there
well that’s it my orders have been rescinded i am officially no go to space
i’m sorry howard but i got to tell you i’m a little relieved you’re not going
come on you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the russians
when was the last time you were at best buy and you heard someone say ooh check out this bluray player it must be good it was built in russia”
well their technology isn’t that bad
when you come back to earth in a soyuz capsule you freefall from space at 500 miles per hour and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground and the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture rocky and bullwinkle
all right well whatever i wasn’t worried
let me explain the difference between you and me you watch star trek i live it
oh please i don’t remember the episode of star trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store
make all the jokes you want but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what i almost did
a little but not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them well i cut quite the dashing yet hygienic figure don’t i i look like the flash about to get married oh a tissue a tissue oh good lord
he keeps emergency purell in the car
before i come in you should know i have gas holds up gas canister
for the record not your worst opening line
check it out it’s the gas i use in my freeelectron laser to support high voltages but it also has an interesting secondary use here breathe this in
bbefore i do it if you’re a cop you have tell me right
okay in weirdly low voice what’s it supposed to… oh my god this is so freaky
you’re a mean one mr grinch
okay me me me ready low voice leonard i am your father
i have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life
oh mm hey you know how we’ve been taking things slow
well i’ve been thinking and maybe i’m ready to take things a little faster
and i promise after waiting four months fast is what you’re gonna get
you know justjust one thing look we’re in a really great place right now and i don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again
so we won’t let it get weird
okay oh and just a headsup mm since the last time you saw me naked i got a cookie monster tattoo the acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing
what about inhales gas in low voice cookies
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
it’s not an accident i waited outside your door for twenty minutes
i must say i was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment as i mentioned the pasadena city council is debating longer crosswalk times and later the lego store is having a midnight madness sale you ask anyone that’s a hot date
tempting choices but i have something special planned for tonight
what can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny lego indiana jones
with our friends moving forward in their relationships i’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well
oh dear lord two years ago we didn’t even know each other and now i’m in your apartment after dark how much faster can this thing go
i had a feeling you’d be reluctant which is why i’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks
oh you brain monkeys kill me dip away
i have devised an experiment that i believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame
and how do you propose to do that uh hope you’re not thinking about some sort of lsd thought control because there’s only one mindexpanding drug that this man enjoys and that’s called school
human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up in your case to your mother superheroes et cetera i’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me
well seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock
we’ll see let’s start with a little romantic dinner music shall we
i see what you’re doing you’re attempting to build on the work of ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood but it won’t work
fine there’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner why don’t you have a seat
may i offer you something to drink
i love strawberry quik it’s my favourite pink fluid narrowly beating out peptobismol
oh i know i think it will go nicely with what i have prepared for dinner
spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it
just like your mommy used to make
oh yummy yummy we should do this more often uhoh
i’m sorry i did i crossed a line i didn’t mean to
who says something like that right in the middle of sex
i don’t know it just came out people say weird things during sex all the time
okay well they sure as hell don’t say that
it was the heat of the moment
no the heat of the moment is ooh yeah just like that not will you marry me
i’m sorry just just give me another chance
why so you can crawl under the covers and go hey baby want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools
again i’m sorry you know with howard and bernadette getting married i got caught up in a little wedding fever i take it back
you can’t take something like that back i mean what are we even supposed to do now
okay at some point we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story why don’t we just start doing that now
no hey do you remember that time when i proposed to you in bed and you were all like what are you doing that was so funny so funny
give it a minute is that a little smile i see there i should go
hey i was thinking for our first dance at the wedding what if we learn the final number from dirty dancing
no come on how cool would that be me running into your arms you lifting me up into the air
oh you’re in a good mood
yeah well why wouldn’t i be you know i’m marrying the girl of my dreams and i finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon phone rings oh hang on oh it’s nasa wolowitz oh hi dave what’s up no kidding really well that’s great news great great news all right i’ll watch my email for the details okay talk soon
it looks like i’m going into space after all
what happened i thought they cancelled your mission
ththey did but nasa really wants my telescope up on the space station so they’re putting me on an earlier launch
what we’re getting married that sunday
you’re right i i can’t go to space i have to get married and no one can say that’s not a good reason i’ll call him back
wait i don’t want to be the one who stands in your way
well too bad you already did it’s a done deal oh well but i forgive you
no that’s not how i want to start our marriage killing your dream we’ll have the wedding when you get back
but what about all the plans and the guests
we’ll call them although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits
you’re right he is your dad’s gonna be furious there’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding well we tried
i’ll talk to him he won’t say no to his little girl
no i uh i should talk to him man to man
but howie my dad can be a bully he’s gonna make you cancel your space flight
we can only hope… that he doesn’t
bishop to queen four level two check
sheldon knight takes bishop you all right
are you you left your queen exposed from above you trapped your knight in the corner and you keep sighing and saying why me
very well can i ask you a question about women
we got you that book last year wasn’t everything in there
no i’m having a relationship problem with amy and by the way that book gave me nightmares
well if it makes you feel any better i screwed things up pretty good with penny
look at us leonard engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies
i guess we are so what’s going on
believe it or not amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy
i’m sorry that must be very difficult for you
it’s awful this morning she arranged for me to be an amtrak junior conductor for the day it it’s usually only open to children she got them to make an exception
they let me blow the whistle leonard
i know and it gets worse her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times
you mean like in bed or in the shower
no would you please stop referencing that infernal book for example this morning i was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale slightly hunched shoulders oh what has that vixen done to me leonard and how do i make it stop
well if you had a physical relationship i’d say propose during sex turns out that’s a real mood killer
i assume we’re talking about you now
so that’s how this works i complain and then you complain and no one offers any solutions
well no wonder the women are winning
i’m just looking at some old pictures come on in
family pictures or… holy crap that’s a dead person
last murder case before i retired how many bodies do you see there careful it’s a trick question
nah you’ll never get it it’s a fraction
how about that anyway sir i need to talk to you about something
oh sure my partner used to have that he’s dead now
nah his wife shot him but she was nuts so in a way
nice story anyway the reason i wanted to talk to you is nasa has moved up my launch to the international space station
so the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter now i know what you’re going to say i made a commitment to bernadette and to your family and i’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing well message heard and understood mission cancelled thank you
i’m sorry may i be excused
no you may not let me tell you something when i first met you… you just gonna stand there
i’m sorry i didn’t know is this going to… well i should sit… may i be seat… well i’ll just sit
when i first met you i didn’t like you
but then you and i had some time together
that silly beatle haircut and you riding around on a red vespa and you still living at home with your mother to be honest i thought bernadette chose you to punish me but then i heard about your astronaut thing and i realized i judged you too fast maybe you are the right guy for my little girl
oh i am and just so you know i’d still be an astronaut even if i didn’t go to space i’ve got an id card and a nasa golf shirt
no no you got to go you can’t turn down an opportunity like this
but what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception
you let me worry about that you go up to that space station and you make me proud
you got a problem with that
all right look i’m gonna level with you i’m terrified about going into space what if i don’t make it back
of course a pretty girl like bernadette she’ll find a new guy
penny just wait i’ve been thinking about what i said when we were in bed the other night
yeah i’ve been thinking about it too
i noticed you never answered me
uh followup are we still dating
is it still weird ’cause i proposed
i have a couple more quick questions do you want to call me from the car
i played that pretty well enters apartment amy dressed as a vulcan starfleet officer is examining sheldon
we’re playing doctor star trek style
i’m in hell leonard don’t stop
i changed my mind i don’t want to do this
yeah i’m a funny guy i also have a hysterical bit planned for later where i pretend to cry through the whole launch
sheldon what channel is nasa tv
289 right between the game show network at 288 and the east coast feed of the disney channel on 290
i love his eidetic memory it’s so sexy sheldon what are the ingredients in pringles
dried potatoes vegetable oil corn flower wheat starch maltodextrin salt and my favourite ingredient of all uniformity
the uterus quivers does it not
there’s howard’s rocket live from kazakhstan
oh god i’m so nervous i don’t think i can watch
you’re nervous i’ve been stresseating for four days look at me i’m wearing my fat pants
remarkable in just under a half hour 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath howard’s keister and all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy has been tetris and mailorder brides
are all of the systems of the ship ready
okay we’re in the final countdown how you doing over there
good good oh quick question i missed it in the briefing how much urine do these suits hold
hey froot loops want to hit your fan switch
he calls you froot loops because of your very gay haircut
no it’s ’cause i live with my mom and she makes me froot loops
go with gay story people are more accepting of that
actually froot loops just got married to a girl
thanks we decided to do it before the launch
you and mrs loops have a big wedding
not exactly listen if you don’t mind i’m not really up for chatting i’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes that went really quick let me try it again
close your eyes put out your hand i got you something special
come on howard i’m not falling for that again
oh howie a little star it’s beautiful put it on me
okay but i’m going to have to get it back from you so i can take it to the international space station that way when i come home you will have a star that was actually in space
take that every guy who’s ever bought you anything
this is the most amazing gift i’ve ever gotten
really well if you like it that much then close your eyes and put out your hand
‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip do you want me to get those little boxes of froot loops you like
no when i eat froot loops the other astronauts make fun of me
howard i don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married
i want to be married to you before you get in that rocket
but i’m leaving in two days
i don’t need to take cereal
what kind of breakfast do you think they’re going to give you in russia
they invented blintzes i’ll be fine
they invented the lightbulb in new jersey it doesn’t mean they hand them out to you when you go
we’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back
you know what i’ll buy you allbran in case you get stopped up in outer space
so anyway we decided to go down to city hall this afternoon get married and then have the reception when howard gets back
that’s so great others also make encouraging sounds
i mean we know it’s short notice but we’d love you all to come with us
no no no this is not the wedding i wanted i want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me while a string quartet plays the way you look tonight
that wasn’t going to be our processional music
well it was going to be mine
thank you for the invitation but i have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something i’ll enjoy
come on sheldon it’ll be fun
that’s what you said about the green lantern movie you were 114 minutes of wrong
so what do you say amy
can i wear my maid of honour dress
seriously you’re going to wear that thing to city hall
it’s all i have left you’re going to take that from me too
from that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos beautiful story they’re in rival drug gangs and they’re getting married shh no one can know
look at all these people in love it kind of gets you thinking doesn’t it
it does indeed leonard is it awkward being here with penny given that you recently proposed to her
i don’t want to talk about it
where did he pop the question what did you say
she said no can we drop it now
why wasn’t it a real proposal
did you get down on one knee or were you already there
howard don’t talk like that on your wedding day
i’m sorry ma… bernadette ma… burna… you’re ma bernadette
what i can’t propose i can’t talk to my friends is there anything else i’m not allowed to do
all right that’s enough today is not about you two today is about howard and bernadette and me
i got this excuse me but is there any way you could squeeze us in see i’m an astronaut and i’m leaving for russia on sunday so i can take a soyuz rocket to the international space station
i can’t believe we’re not going to get married
excuse me i’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour
so i tell my wife get a dog don’t get a dog i’m not walking it i’m not feeding it i’m not picking up after it
you know you’re going to wind up walking it
uh shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs
dimitri froot loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff
okay i’m going into space and when i come back i have to pick up a poodle crap
you know we could always drive to vegas and get married
no isn’t that kind of tacky
hey i know tons of people who got married in vegas
are any of them still married
yeah i mean not to the same people but…
there’s got to be some place special we could do it
leonard where did you envision marrying penny
well i know how to make it special
i told you we are not recreating the wedding from the sound of music
yes you made that brutally clear to me what i was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until sunday morning the google satellite will be over pasadena you can have a wedding photograph from space
i keep telling you if i wasn’t an astrophysicist i would have been a party planner it was always a coin flip
okay so we know we’re going to do it sunday morning now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us
oh my gosh i can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on google earth
so we have the where and the when but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony
well that’s easy anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister i know a piercing parlour where for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want
great well who’s it going to be
i’ll do it provided i can perform the ceremony in klingon
what do you see in her
mission control say again how fast is it leaking
not bad we feel okay to go
there’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go
don’t lose your froot loops froot loops
this happens a lot nine times out of ten no problem
what happens on the tenth time
hey guys before i forget i got you a little groomsman present
you didn’t have to do that
fantastic four annual number three from 1965 in mint condition the one where mr fantastic and the invisible girl get married
oh dear i was afraid of this
while a thoughtful gift this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars
i bought you and bernadette a gravy boat worth eightyeight dollars which places me in your debt and i can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move or to kill a man
i doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man
well what if it’s his only way out i can’t risk it here is twelve dollars now we’re even wait wait wait i bought a card give me two dollars and for the record this is why i hate giftgiving
can’t come in bad luck to see the bride
okay uh fine bernie i have to go pick up my mother i’ll be right back
she doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so i’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van
okay i’ll see you later ma… uh… lovely bridetobe i really got to watch that
come on raj we’re ready to start
what we’re ready when i say we’re ready uhdududu ooh okay now we’re ready
ma you want to move your chair over here so you can see
i’m fine where i am i don’t want to fall off the roof
you’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it
your new motherinlaw’s a piece of work
she’s got a bigger mustache than me here you go
here you go what am i a football
like that guy could catch a football
howard and bernadette the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers
they all got ordained they’re all marrying us it’s adorable if you want to hear come closer
guys when i look at the two of you starting your lives together it fills my heart it fills my heart okay i’m going to need a minute
okay i’ll i’ll go howard and bernadette i know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding but when you’re in love it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen it just matters that you have each other
i think the reverend hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom
all right that’s enough from the both of you
well i’m ending it bernadette i want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour i also want you to know that i will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out
thank you amy very touching howard and bernadette you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other and that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core it has kindness patience and respect qualities that are hard to find in people these days
would you like some aloe vera you just got burned all right my turn howard bernadette daq tu’ tah daq yin tlhej ghajtah
sheldon i told you no klingon
fine i’ll do it in english but it loses something the need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me maybe because i’m so interesting all by myself with that being said may you find as much happiness with each other as i find on my own the klingon would have made you cry
i believe you two have prepared vows
howard joel wolowitz like you this is going to be short and sweet i love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever
hey from now on she’s the only women who can yell at me until i met you i couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person and now i can’t imagine spending one day of it without you
by the power vested in us by the state of california…
we now pronounce you husband and wife
that’s ignition i love this part
i can’t believe it this whole time a small part of me thought he was lying
so howard’s really in space huh
mmhmm international space station 250 miles that way
right now howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny jewish greek god zeusowitz
i must admit i can’t help but feel a twinge of envy he can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes his dim uncomprehending eyes it’s like a cat in an airport carrying case
you know it’s not exactly glamorous up there the water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine
must be nice nobody wants anything that comes out of me
i wonder what he’s doing right this very second
mm conducting experiments in zero gravity
peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos
whatever it is we know his life will never be the same
i can hear you without the phone
don’t be snippy i’m just excited to talk to my baby
i’m excited to talk to you too
so what’s this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little polish girl
how about calling her my wife
wives don’t take boys from their mothers
they do that’s why we marry them
i just hope i’m not dead from a broken heart before you get back
ma please everyone from nasa is listening to this phone call
good they should know what a horrible son you are
okay ma great talking to you gotta go well space is ruined
this is so exciting soon my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend
hey this is my natural hair colour now so does sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night
oh yes according to the relationship agreement on the anniversary of our first date he must take me to a nice dinner ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy
that’s hot you kids better use protection
how long does this stay on
just a couple of minutes you’ve really never done this before
once in high school but i dozed off and woke up with seconddegree chemical burns on my face
oh my gosh that’s awful the other kids make fun of you
no i had a cover story i told everyone it was herpes so how’s everything going with you and leonard
uh i don’t know it’s still kind of weird we haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex
oh boohoo if sheldon proposed to me during sex my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go
leonard where do you stand on the anthropic principle
interesting question on the one hand i always thought…
you don’t even know what it is do you the anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question as i am doing so eloquently right now
i know what the anthropic principle is
of course i just explained it to you now where do you stand on it
where do you stand on it
then i believe that god created the world in six days and on the seventh he made you to annoy me
yeah wait raj where do you stand on the anthropic principle
well hang on why do you believe that he knows what it is and i don’t
oh leonard let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on shall we
hey uh if you guys are free tonight i heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them i don’t need to tell you in los angeles sandal season is year round
actually i’m hanging out with penny
oh okay sounds like it’s me and you sheldon how about we sic some guppies on those puppies
as i’ve stated before on numerous occasions the only sea creature i would even consider being eaten by is the kraken because the last words i would hear are “release the kraken” that never gets old “release the kraken” oh chills besides i’m having dinner with amy
oh okay i’ll just go home and be alone which is cool i eat alone i sleep alone i cry alone so cool
darn if you weren’t busy i’d ask you to join us
sheldon are you sure you want to be bringing raj on your date night with amy
oh absolutely i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation and casual physical contact but nowhere is it specified that i can’t outsource that to an indian
hey there’s my beautiful bride can you see me
i’m amazing i mean this is even better than i dreamed i look out the window and it’s all so unbelievable
good for you i just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom
it was until i found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her let’s talk about that for a minute
hey look this pen is floating how crazy is that
you said you told her but you never did
okay okay i know you’re upset but let me share something i’ve learned since i got here you realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space now come on that’s got to make you feel better
how clear is the image of me on that screen
do i look like i feel better
i mean it’s not like hd quality
listen mister you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this or that thing i said i was gonna do to you the minute you got home you can do to yourself
like he’s been doing since he got here
sheldon this place is so romantic
oh i’m glad you like it raj picked it out
well when you see him tell him i say thank you
i don’t understand what’s he doing here
on our date sheldon that’s not okay
yes it is there’s a loophole in the relationship agreement
sorry i started without you i’m a little nervous it’s been a long time since i’ve been on a date
i can’t believe i bleached my moustache for this
you should go to my girl she’ll knock out those sideburns for free
you know amy i don’t even think you and i have had a real conversation let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better you start
sheldon how could you do this it’s our second anniversary
it’s your anniversary oh my god i had no idea amy please let me make this right
my pleasure waiter a bottle of champagne and three glasses oh boy isn’t this romantic
oh i hope that’s a rhetorical question because i have no clue
this is great what’s the occasion
no occasion you know things have been a little weird between us so i wanted to throw together a fun night just for you
i got all your favourites beer wings sliders we can watch the football game i even painted my stomach
well in case you were in the mood for baseball i didn’t want to look ridiculous
this is awesome i love it
gosh i worked my ass off today this is exactly what i needed
great just relax and enjoy tonight is all about you
so where exactly are we in this relationship
oh come on i just told you i had a hard day
you’re right i’m sorry let’s watch the game
i just know the longer we wait to talk about it the weirder it gets
sweetie can i just be the girl tonight
absolutely you’re the girl i’m the guy now you watch your football game while i make you a little plate here
oh i’ll get it go sports
what are you doing here i thought you were out with sheldon and amy
i was but it’s their anniversary and i didn’t want to be a third wheel so i figured i’d come over here and hang out with you and penny on your date
well it’s not really a great time penny and i have some things we need to talk about
no we don’t come on in
i can’t believe i shaved my stomach for this
hey froot loops you got a phone call
a woman who says she’s your mother but sounds like your father
hey ma you know we could see each other if you turn on the computer
i’m not going near that fakakta thing i’ll catch a computer virus
you can’t catch a computer virus
oh so now you’re an astronaut and a doctor
your wife says you have something important to tell me
okay here it is bernadette and i are starting a life together and…
oh god you are gonna leave me
it’s okay your father left me you left me i guess i’m just the kind of person people like to leave
it’s not definite i’ll talk to bernadette
don’t bother i’ll just go sit in a hole in the ground so i’m no trouble when i die
stop it ma i’m sure i can get bernie to come around
i knew it i knew she was behind this you listen to me if you want to be a man you can’t let a woman tell you what to do
oy i can’t believe these people won the cold war
now can we please change the subject
fine explain why you’ve been gone so long and i haven’t gotten a single letter not even a lousy postcard
you know i’m growing to like american football
well it’s not the ballstothewall action of badminton or cricket but hey what is
all right who’s ready for another beer
oh i’m having the nicest time you guys are like family to me you know that right
penny and i have some issues we need to talk about
oh pish on your issues you guys are fine yes you hit some bumps along the way i mean penny you’ve always known how this man has felt about you but you made him grovel for affection
now don’t blame yourself he was a groveller from way back but the point is the two of you got past it and leonard you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex that was some weak tea dude
some people might say it was romantic
yeah no but yet here you two are still together and that’s even after you and i had our crazy naked night
i’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “i love you” and that’s beautiful
actually to this day she’s never really said it
oh penny that’s ridiculous you know you love him you you look him in the eyes and you say it
oh come on you know you want to say it say it say you love him say it
i really thought she would say it
have i ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis
you know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis they devour their mate
you know what i’m done with this
you can’t leave i need you
sheldon you either say something meaningful and from the heart or you and i are done
all right please amy when i look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine everything feels not quite normal because i feel stronger and weaker at the same time i feel excited and at the same time terrified the truth is i don’t know what i feel except i know what kind of man i want to be
i should hope so that’s from the first spiderman movie
good now i assume we’re splitting the cheque
oh hey i was actually just about to close up
no no it’s okay hang out
yeah you’re my first customer today
i’m uh having a nightcap you want to join me
coffee liqueur in a chewbacca mug i call it a sadtini
perfect for the night i’m having thank you
hmm nice not to drink alone
amen to that sometimes i pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl
she’s kind of a mean drunk but what are you gonna do
sure mmm bossa nova you listen to that with your hips as well as your ears
oh something about latin music just makes me feel like i’m on a white sand beach in rio
yeah the sun the waves the beautiful bodies tanned and glistening with sweat
uh thank you for the drink
do you want to hang out tomorrow night maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie
yeah ii’d like to but i’m a little tight on funds
no problem my treat i’ll swing by after work
aw that’s such good news howie thank you for telling her
hey i’m a grown man i’m gonna live with my wife my mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own
who can tell she yells everything she might have been upset she might have been hungry
thanks for fixing it i love you
i love you too sweet dreams i’ll talk to you tomorrow
loops you realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother
what are you gonna do when you get back to earth
and the next wedding gift is a gravy boat
that’s from sheldon he told me he had it engraved
in the event of a divorce please return to sheldon cooper
one inappropriate yet i wish i thought of that gravy boat
when i get married i’m going to register at the ucla cadaver lab
‘cause i’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy
so you actually see you and sheldon getting married someday
not just someday in exactly four years but don’t tell sheldon he’s still a flight risk
do you think you and leonard might ever get married
oh well you know leonard is great
but do you think you’ll ever get married
you’re not answering the question do you love him
yeah sure of course i love him
no he’d just take it the wrong way
it means he is special and smart and nice and…
are you gonna break up with him
i had no idea you were unhappy
that’s the thing i’m not i’m not unhappy at all it’s just i don’t know i i’ve been in love before but it felt different but maybe this is a new better boring kind of love do you ever feel that way about howard
oh that’s not really a fair comparison i’m basically married to a sexy buzz lightyear
can’t help ya kid whenever i’m around sheldon i feel like my loins are on fire in the good way not the urinary tract infection way
hey buddy how’s it going up there
you don’t have to shout raj it’s not like i’m an astronaut floating around in outer space oh wait i am
so is it everything you hoped it would be
it’s better i wake up every morning and i just can’t believe i’m on this incredible adventure
hey froot loops did you clean the space toilet
excuse me i’m talking to my friends
you know the rules new guy scrubs the toilet
if you do good job next time we give you brush
funny we’re always giving each other a hard time up here it’s kind of like being in a frat you know joking kidding around hurting feelings
okay my turn let me talk to him
2311 north los robles avenue pasadena california to international space station can you read me over makes static noise
i am talking to a man in space if you don’t have the static noise then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street
that’s a negative my mother had me tested over static noise
come on scrub it up loops
all right all right i gotta go there’s a meteor shower
you want to see a meteor shower take a look at what dimitri just left you in the toilet
um raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys
excuse me i didn’t authorize this
sheldon you are not in charge
that’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner
what’s the big deal you guys are bringing your girlfriends i didn’t want to sit by myself
the big deal is i was expecting us to be an intimate group of five now we’re going to be a faceless mass of six
it’ll be fine just uh pretend he’s wolowitz
i can take them or leave them
at the movies wolowitz always eats raisinets
would you feel more comfortable if i ate raisinets
well it’s hardly my business what you eat as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s raisinets
yuhuh one more question if you’re going to replace wolowitz i need to know a little more about you
wolowitz went to mit what’s your educational background
this insistence on handholding is preposterous
yeah of course you do you’re a girl you like all kinds of hippydippy things
it’s not fair penny isn’t making leonard hold hands
there might be a reason for that
sweaty unhygienic looks dumb take your pick
penny said she’s not sure she wants to be leonard’s girlfriend anymore
wrong she just took a sip from his diet dr pepper
so if she wants to end her pairbond with leonard why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit
string theory is complicated that’s just yucky don’t get any ideas all right for the sake of argument let’s say that’s true why doesn’t penny just end the relationship
she’s not sure how she feels
how can she not be sure how she feels you know when i have a feeling i know it trains love them swordfish i love them too they’re fish with a sword for a nose
regardless don’t say anything to leonard
now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend colleague and roommate
yes please penny will kill me
uh fine fyi secretkeeping hate it handholding not a fan hammerhead shark i love that thing yeah it’s another fish with a tool on its head
shh we’re trying to watch the movie this is not working out with him
i think i might have tartar buildup my tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to
nope oh you have no idea how annoying this is
i’m starting to get a sense of it don’t worry i’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow
thank you i appreciate that you’re good people leonard there’s something i need to tell you
i can’t tell you why i can’t tell you so i guess there’s two things i can’t tell you
good night i’m sorry this is really important
i like the transformers do you like the transformers
where exactly did your mother have you tested
leonard the transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be you know like uh a semi truck might be an alien robot or uh someone in a romantic relationship uh might feel differently than they appear to or a conversation about the transformers might actually be about someone in this room i’m going to pause to let that sink in
the guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you but your relationship with amy is causing you to transform into a redblooded man with sexual desires
that is literally the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
i was now i’m having a nightmare what do you want
never mind i still can’t tell you
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny penny wakes up and screams sheldon also screams
what are you doing in my bedroom
yeah well i knocked on the front door but you didn’t hear it
how did you even get in you weirdo
yeah really i’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years but when i do it it’s weird
oh i was having a little trouble sleeping and i just thought uh seeing as you’re up we could talk
oh i don’t know uh weather uh fish you could do carpentry with why leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend yeah pick one your choice
did you know that leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that hubbahubba
yeah did you know that while leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country in today’s north korea he’s downright average hey talk about a keeper
okay what did amy tell you
oh very well i can’t keep up this clever charade any longer she told me that you were thinking of ending it with leonard
okay you listen to me i think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend but this is none of your business got it
excuse me this is not about protecting my friend i’m a big fan of homeostasis do you know what that is
homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or ph
my point is i don’t like when things change so regardless of your feelings i would like you to continue dating leonard and also while we’re on the subject you recently changed your shampoo i’m not comfortable with the new scent please stop this madness and go back to green apple
okay honey i have a lot to figure out and until i do you are not to say a word to leonard do you understand
i do you clear on the shampoo issue
that is the last thing i want to do
thank you coconut what were you thinking are you a hula girl
what the hell is wrong with you you told sheldon do you know what a terrible position this puts me in phone beeps
i know she’s yelling at me right now
all right then so we’re all on the same page yes
there’s my hubby how’s everything going up there
oh it’s okay space is beautiful earth is beautiful same old same old
the other astronauts are being mean to me
well like for instance the other day when i was asleep one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a bigeyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window when i woke up i screamed for like nine minutes
you can see it if you want it’s on youtube google astronaut screams for nine minutes
why don’t you stand up to them
what am i supposed to say
i don’t know say being mean is lame what’s cool is being nice
great i’ll do that when i want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie
do you want me to call somebody at nasa
no my mom already tried that it only made things worse
i’m sorry wolowitz would never play that card
fairy god monster i win your desperate need for friendship makes you weak
so what are you guys doing later stuart and i were thinking of going out for a drink
we’re gonna try to meet some girls
watch out ladies a little coffee and cream coming your way
in case you didn’t follow that i’m the coffee
leonard maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls
why would i be interested i have penny
yeah for now but that woman has a death wish leonard she talks to strangers she pets unfamiliar dogs and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment if i were you i’d get a backup
you can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person
no please don’t ruin this for me
do you remember how upset i was when they replaced edward norton as the hulk
yes you walked around for a week saying sheldon unhappy with casting choice
but then mark ruffalo was the hulk in the avengers and he was even better
call me a romantic i like to think that your mark ruffalo is still out there somewhere
this is ridiculous are we gonna play cards or not
yeah settle down there fake wolowitz no one likes a kissup
so i had to take sheldon to the dentist this morning
yup i told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist i’d take him for ice cream
i didn’t have to take him for ice cream
you okay you seem a little distracted
look there’s something i need to tell you
i don’t really know how to say this
i didn’t know what else to do he had those big sad eyes
oh sure you had no choice
he looked at me like this
well if that’s all it takes it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog
don’t worry you’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him your wedding day your honeymoon your 50th anniversary
look it’s fine we’re not getting married okay we’re keeping things you know homeostasis
it’s so cute when she tries
it’s from leonard last night was amazing you’re amazing i’m so lucky to have you in my life they give him a hangdog look okay stop it
hey bernie guess what i stood up to the other astronauts like you said and i got to tell you last night was the first time in a week i got a good night’s sleep on screen howard has a mouse face drawn on his face and the words floops on his forehead
nope this is my proud face
hey how’s my little astronautie hottie
okay i guess it’s just being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me
well hang in there you just have a couple more days to go and then you’ll be home
i got to get back to work i love you
love you too hey bernie before you go can you do something for me
what do you want me to do
okay here it is i really miss gravity can you drop something so i can watch it fall
really you’re serious okay drops a pencil
ugh hey sheldon hi this came for you today it’s from your mom
yeah wait here for your troubles
oh boy a whole dollar now i can quit my paper route so what’s in it
mmm doesn’t matter half the time he just ends up playing with the box
yeah it’s journals and research papers i wrote as a child
aw how cute is this like a diary
no that’s my potty training journal
yeah and forgive my crude penmanship i didn’t start typing until i was six
there are some charts in the back where i kept track of shape colour and consistency
no what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track
why do you need all this stuff
i am glad you asked are you familiar with the higgs boson
of course it is it’s been in the news and it’s a very famous boson
nice try now in 1964 dr peter higgs accomplished selfpromoter and physicist he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the higgs boson now initially the paper was rejected but recently he was proven right and now he’s on the fast track to win a nobel prize
yeah that’s basically what i said
yeah the point is higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago so that got me thinking perhaps i’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my nobel prize
i didn’t know they gave nobel prizes for making boomboom in the potty
you really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here
well this box only covers my work through nursery school there’s a good deal more to come i didn’t really hit my academic stride until i cut out that timesuck known as playing outdoors
so you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff
that’s a good point my time is much too valuable you know perhaps i should find someone to do it for me you know someone with a rudimentary understanding of science but whose real talents lie in menial labour
well if i didn’t think you could handle it i wouldn’t be asking
if you want help just hire a grad student
you really you can assess the quality of my work okay um here i wrote this when i was five years old
a proof that algebraic topology can never have a non selfcontradictory set of abelion groups i’m just a blonde monkey to you aren’t i
all right ms jenson uh before we begin may i offer you a refreshment water coffee tea a marijuana cigarette
now are you sure everyone’s smoking them i think they’re the best
excellent yeah that was a ruse they’re not the best physics is the best and by the way coffee was also an unacceptable choice all right so i see here you’re from des moines iowa uh you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from stanford university oh and two years ago you had a persistent ear infection i hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss
no of course not how did you know about that
i did a comprehensive background check medical records credit reports criminal history hiding mouth behind book  i trust you paid off those parking tickets
look dr cooper i really want this position it would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance
flattery will not get you this job ms jenson
it’s not flattery if it’s the truth
oh well thank you welcome aboard
uh yeah last night he kept making me drop pencils for him i got uncomfortable entering sheldon’s office  hey sheldon hope you’re hungry they’re serving macaroni and… spots ms jenson  cheeeeeese
sheldon aren’t you going to introduce us
no i have people for that now you’re up
i’m alex dr cooper’s new assistant
ah congratulations and may god have mercy on your soul i’m leonard this is raj
it’s nice to meet you i’m so excited to be working with dr…
yeah please reserve chitchat for your breaks ms jenson fyi there will be no breaks
i should probably get to work
hey you already got a girlfriend i call dibs
all i said was she seems nice
hey i wasn’t expecting to hear from you today everything okay
well remember the soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home
it’s delayed we’re gonna be here at least another week maybe ten days it’s the russians so you don’t know they left dogs up here in the sixties
come on howard no one’s leaving you up there
i don’t know how much longer i can take this i can’t sleep and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux i’m down to my last three tums
you’re going to be fine you survived that weight watchers cruise with your mom and they ran out of lowfat ice cream on day two just calm down and take a few deep breaths
okay okay what am i doing i’m using up all the oxygen if i die promise you’ll never have sex with another man
oh yeah i’m a maneater now
okay for the final touch this is an eyelash curler you just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed
oh i don’t know looks like something used by tinkerbell’s gynecologist
who i hope for her sake is not captain hook so… who are you calling
i’m going to videochat sheldon if my new look leads to phone sex i’m going to have to ask you to leave the room
i’m alex dr cooper’s assistant can i help you
i’d like to speak to sheldon
i’m sorry he’s asked me to hold all calls unless you’re stephen hawking his mother or himself from the future
all right well tell him amy called
he knows my last name i’m his girlfriend we have a contract and everything i’ll send you a pdf
all right i will tell him you called
sheldon told me he had a new assistant named alex he didn’t mention that alex was a girl
you’re right i don’t have to worry about sheldon
it’s her i have to worry about
oh amy really she is not going to come on to sheldon
oh really look at this face sheldon’s picture on phone how can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it
well for starters at some point that face starts talking
amy this is crazy you have nothing to be suspicious about
i’m not suspicious i just want to stop in say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant throwing open sheldon’s office door aha
hang on rubs sheldon’s telephone receiver under her armpit
isn’t it obvious i’m spreading my scent to mark my territory
come on amy that is not gonna work
really because just before you became my best friend i did this all over your apartment
has your uh assistant said anything about me
oh in fact she has uh her exact words were what is that guy’s problem
i’m in her head let the dance begin
here’s your frozen yoghurt dr cooper
half chocolate half vanilla side by side not swirled
one on top one on the bottom
um top one yes i didn’t check the one on the bottom
it’s all right alex i’m not mad at you i’m just disappointed
wait alex do you want to join us
uh alex a moment i need a word with dr hofstadter do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us given her station
if i’ve learned anything from british television shows on pbs it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind
it’s a kindness leonard otherwise you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their sootstained fingertips
so alex what’s the topic of your dissertation
i’m looking for trojan asteroids at earth’s lfive lagrange point
oh that happens to be dr koothrappali’s field of expertise you two have a lot to talk about
is that true is he all right
no but compared to your boss he’s the poster boy for sanity
it’s okay i’ve been around scientists all my life my dad’s an astronomer at seti
oh seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence you should introduce him to sheldon the search is over
so what kind of research are you doing
not yet but i can remove unwanted hair from two miles away
you were right i had nothing to worry about that skank’s your problem not mine
how you doing howie you feeling a little better
oh a lot better thanks one sec listen close i don’t have a lot of time i need you to go to my house in my bedroom you’ll find a model rocket i want you to take it and bring it back to your place
step two build a version roughly fourteen stories high fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me i’ll leave the door unlocked
howie honey maybe you should talk to someone let them know you’re having a little anxiety
no no i’m fine no anxiety we should probably talk in code from now on frog is me sandwich means you and lemon means rocket so come on sandwich build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home
look at you putting on a brave face
there’s nothing to be brave about everything’s fine
really i don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour but sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting leonard were she a mandrill she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat by the way you try that at the junior prom you get kicked out
okay maybe she was flirting with him but who cares look i don’t even know where my relationship is with leonard is right now
so says your prefrontal cortex but meanwhile the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to leonard it must be because he’s desirable
well of course he’s desirable i mean he’s great he’s smart he’s sweet and ooh in the bedroom whew let me tell you he really tries
fine it bothers me a little no you know what this is stupid it doesn’t bother me okay it bothers me but only because she wouldn’t stop laughing leonard is not that funny
and there you have it prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust if this were a boxing match they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala if you were a brain scientist you would be busting a gut right now
ah it was all right i guess got to heimlich a cherry stem out of sheldon caught raj right in the eye
no raj had to go to the nurse
mmm the nurse is a woman so he couldn’t talk to her she had to bring him a grover puppet so he could point at what hurt
isn’t that enough it had the weaponised fruit and a puppet what more do you want
oh good leonard you’re here science news this will interest you and penny feel free to paint your nails
i believe alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the nobel prize behold
the original title was “a rederivation of maxwell’s equations regarding electromagnetism”” i dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say i was a witch
sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis
oh it’s about time i hated the old way hi i’m penny
alex uh do you work with dr hofstadter
in a way we’ve kind of been involved in a fiveyear experiment
oh well you’re lucky he seems very talented and i’m sure a lot of people want to work with him
well a lot of people can’t uh hey
my limbic system wants to take your pants off
notice people on your own time we’re working
better much better the other astronauts held me down gave me a shot oooh attention people of earth tonight there will be two moons in the sky
howie stop that nasa’s watching this put your pants back on
howard’s capsule should be reentering the atmosphere any minute
it’ll be good to have him back
yeah you had a good run fake wolowitz we’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness the way we do the dialup modem the vhs tape or or leonard’s gym membership
we’re not kicking him out stuart and i have become good friends
okay one vote for one vote against leonard you’re the tiebreaker
i don’t have a problem with stuart besides he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store
well i don’t sell my friendship that cheaply
okay the nasa web site says howard’s final descent has begun
he left a boy he returns a boysized hero
baruch atah adonai eloheinu melech haolam hamotzi lechem min haaretz
the jewish prayer for eating bread we don’t have one for falling out of space we did it we’re on the ground we survived
that was just the parachute we still have another six miles to go howard screams again
he’s coming back from outer space
i think this flight’s coming from houston
no i mean he… never mind there he is howie
whoa thank you great to be back on earth
i missed you too where are the guys
oh i get it they’re waiting back home with a big surprise party don’t worry i can act surprised does
no i told them they could have you tomorrow night tonight you belong to me sneezes
i am now that you’re back come on let’s go home so i can tear off those little pants
great just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting
you know i am very disappointed that i won’t be able to celebrate howard’s accomplishment tonight
me too but we’ll see him tomorrow
yes it’s just that in all the years i’ve known him he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration i was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened
all right pictionary what are the teams
oh that hardly seems fair but i guess any team that i’m not on has a decided disadvantage
batman batman and robin uh wonder twins plus the monkey wonder twins plus the monkey and batman
oh leonard now how can you not get that
in what universe is that a present
it’s not a present it’s the present look there’s you and me there’s penny and amy we’re playing pictionary in the present
oh my god we’re gonna kill them
it’s asymptotically free partons inside a quarkgluon plasma
it’s an observational rebuttal of the lambdacdm model of the universe
hey if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie you draw a glass of milk next to it
yeah only after i eliminated all the obvious answers you’re welcome
oh uh uh uh sausage uh uh uh uh bratwurst oh oh a hot dog
penny aren’t you gonna draw something
relax we got time this is so fun
a solar system uh uh uh uh um unidentified flying liverwurst i don’t…
come on leonard i am spoonfeeding this to you
i don’t know uh casper the alcoholic ghost
wait no no no the word is polish see look polish sausage and the the model of the solar system developed by nicolaus copernicus a polish astronomer and then finally if that wasn’t enough which it should have been this is madame curie killing herself by discovering radium who although she was a naturalized french citizen was polish by birth
excuse me the word is polish see small p
ah so it is i guess we both share blame on this one
yeah i’ll be right there hacking and coughing noises
did you get a sea lion while i was gone
took some benadryl i’ll be fine so did you miss me
oh are you kidding every minute of every…
sweetie we don’t have to do this now
yes we do you left right after we got married this is like our honeymoon now hold on to your hat oh uhoh
a little dizzy must be the benadryl switch places with me
now kiss me he does she starts snoring
that was amazing you made me feel things i never… starts snoring again
well that was quick and a little gross now i know how she feels
hey sheldon you’re always full of fun little facts where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from
i wonder if it’s from like ancient rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go here you know to appease loseroneous the god of losers
i am not a loser pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill
mmm in all fairness pictionary has verbal skills visual skills it’s a pretty wellrounded game
lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie
all right fine pick another game amy and i will beat you at anything
all right let’s play physics fiesta
oh come on what is that
it’s a game that i just invented in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial spanish um ¿dónde está el boson de higgs
no no we’re not playing some dumb madeup game
all games are made up they’re not found in nature you don’t just dig in the ground come across a rich vein of rock’em sock’em robots
why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo
that is true i have a higher than normal body density if i run too deep a bath i drown
all right let’s keep it simple how about darts
darts is a bar game you’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age
well regardless she has a distinct advantage in all tavernbased competitions pool beer pong wet tshirt contests they’re all out
okay just for the record i have never entered a wet tshirt contest i’ve won a few but that’s just because i spill when i’m drunk so…
we could go to the cadaver lab at ucla and play reallife operation
are you sure i mean the nose doesn’t light up but if the corpse is fresh enough sometimes you can get the leg to jerk
hey ma twinkle twinkle your little star is home ma the chain’s on the door
howard i thought i wasn’t going to see you till tomorrow
yeah well bernie’s not feeling well so i thought i’d stop by tell you about the greatest adventure of my life see if you can make me feel bad about it
uh uh okay hold on i’m not decent

57 58 59 that’s one minute
long division long division go go go
i’m okay i’m okay i’m not okay
get up we can’t lose at math
ready set wrestle penny pins sheldon straight away one two three pin
amy do something amy help amy stop that amy penny both of you stop it
oh my god you’re back oh look at you you you look like you grew
yeah the lack of gravity did decompress my spine so i’m like an inch and a half taller i’m going to the dmv tomorrow to get my license changed before i shrink back
oh uh come in come in oh i uh i didn’t think i was going to get to see you until tomorrow
yeah well bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist
wait your your mother is sleeping with your dentist
former dentist i need a new one now that i know where his hands have been
so you’re wandering all around by yourself that’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to
it’s okay you know we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame we leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your howie mandels
oh stuart thanks what are you doing here
i i kind of live here now
just until he gets back on his feet which are looking pretty good in the boots i bought him for his birthday

sheldon we haven’t won a game all night now you either stick your face in that pie or i’m gonna stick that pie in your face
hey guys guess who’s back from space
oh ow blueberry in my nose blueberry in my nose
snort it down and keep eating
yeah i just saw you on the news you’re an astronaut
good for you how about a piece of cheesecake on the house
oh thank you so much i’ve been having the worst night i just got back and my friends don’t care my wife’s sick i went to my mom…
you want the cheesecake or not
yes please sings and i think it’s gonna be long long time till touchdown brings me ’round again to find i’m not the man they think i am at home oh no oh no i’m a rocket man sneezes perfect
oh hey stuart i got you a little souvenir from my trip to space
well howard that’s very nice of you
to stuart your comic book store is out of this world just like the guy in this picture was”
for the record he also thinks the walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world
that’s not true at the walgreens i was over the moon for their storebrand antacids
hey stuart i see you’re getting ready for your halloween party
yeah it’s my annual attempt to meet women ninth time’s the charm
would you like me to help i do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees
thanks but i can’t afford je ne sais quois how much for just quois
you know you don’t worry about money i’ll take care of everything
yeah you’ll love it ain’t no party like a koothraparty
but you know what wasn’t a party that hotel in kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch i mean it’s your last night on earth you’d think you’d get one porn channel
have you noticed that howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space
interesting hypothesis let’s apply the scientific method perform an experiment
okay hey howard any thoughts on where we should get dinner
anywhere but the space station on a good day dinner was a bag full of meat loaf but hey you don’t go there for the food you go there for the view
it’s fascinating let me see if i can duplicate the result howard i’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit care to weigh in
you know people say the soyuz capsule was a lemon but hey that baby got me to space and back
ladies night at the cheesecake factory does it get any better than this
question do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin
it’s not getting any better text tone ugh it’s leonard he wants to go costume shopping later
i do it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store a lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy
i’m i’m sorry amy you were saying something about howard’s foreskin
nice try but you have to go to that party because we’re going
yeah i’m gonna go it’s just not my idea of a good time
leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy
well yeah he’s my boyfriend isn’t that like his job
i just think in relationships you get back what you put into them
that’s not always true last night i gave sheldon my best comehither look and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated
i guess i could probably try a little harder
you could start by taking an interest in his work
yeah that’s kind of a problem
not really clear on what he does
yeah i’m not really clear on what that means
he takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy
yeah you’re really just making it worse
what kind of tea would you like
i think i’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger
two tea bags in one cup you’re not at a rave
so listen sheldon i was thinking since this is gonna be our first halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend i thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume
really i find that inconsistent with everything i know about you
oh oh on the contrary couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship now imagine this you and i entering stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see america’s most beloved and glamorous couple
r2d2 and c3po dibs on threepio
sheldon when i said couples costume i meant like romeo and juliet or cinderella and prince charming not two robots from some silly movie i don’t even like
okay i’m gonna let that slide because i know you’re hopped up on tea bags
i make compromises for you all the time just this once can’t we find something that we’re both happy with
fine how about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century hewlett and packard dibs on hewlett what you want to be hewlett
hey what are you doing here
i just thought i’d stop by and say hello
oh what a nice surprise i don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before
no i know it’s long overdue so what ya doing better not be building a robot girlfriend
no although howard was making some real strides in that area until he met bernadette
nope now the lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring
ooh what’s going on in here
oh no no no don’t look in there
no it’s a nitrogen laser it’ll cook your eyeball like a softboiled egg
oh you might want to put a sign on it
ah danger sure sure yeah what’s what’s that
uh that is an integrated ion trap and timeofflight mass spectrometer
wow hightechietechie what’s this little box
ooh lowtechietechie so what are you working on right now
yeah it’s a frontprojected holographic display combined with laserbased finger tracking here i’ll show you we’ll just put this pencil over here
sharp thanks to the machine we saw earlier
very good and then a laser will map the reflective surface and voila a floating 3d image of the pencil appears leonard moves it around with his finger
you know there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram
what do you mean leonard flicks a switch the hologram changes to a view of the planet earth oh wow
uhhuh well the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really changes view to solar system just be information changes view to the galaxy on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos starts the galaxy spinning so it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe
sometimes i forget how smart you are
you should visit more often what are you doing
yeah you got a problem with that
no no it’s kind of crazy i’ve never fooled around in the lab before
no i did have a shot with the lisatronic but the extension cord wasn’t long enough
before i forget i’d like your opinion on the menus i’ve prepared for the halloween party the theme is food that goes bump in the night
creature from the black forest ham lagoon
night of the living garlic bread
it’s funny because bread sounds like dead
i’m sorry but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns the dishes themselves are in no way halloweenie
ooh hallowweenies that’s a good one they’ll pair nicely with my draculoni and cheese how do i do it
that reminds me i was thinking about wearing my nasa jumpsuit as a costume but then i realized everyone would be like where’s your costume why are you wearing your work clothes you nut
you know where’s there’s a lot of nothing
boy it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again did i tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock
yeah you mentioned it once or twice
so here we are just a couple of young newlyweds what to do what to do to you astronaut wolowitz reporting for booty preparing thrusters we have liftoff are we clear to jettison that nightgown
howie i know you went to space i’m incredibly proud of you but you might want to try and not bring it up every minute
i don’t talk about it every minute
tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight
what was i supposed to talk about we were eating at johnny rockets
i’m just saying people are getting a little tired of it
so i did this amazing thing and i’m never allowed to mention it
of course you can but maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up
okay no problem it won’t happen again
i love you too i can’t tell you how many times i dreamed i was in bed here with you when i was… you know what i can’t even point
so basically this is what’s called maglev technology it uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity here you hold this
yeah oh uh you don’t have on any jewellery do you
a grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size now watch this
sometimes i like to turn this on and pretend i’m the super villain magneto
getting a little less cool leonard
but what i really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him
so i thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb or they also have the tardis from doctor who
a tardis makes no sense it’s a time machine from a sciencefiction show it has nothing to do with halloween that being said if you don’t get a tardis you stink and your party stinks
i don’t care get the tardis
yes this party just became a major rager
oh by the way can i borrow your bullwhip and fedora
i was thinking of dressing up as indiana jones’ mochaskinned love child indian jones
oh howard i’ve got a party to plan don’t make me pull it out of you
okay here it is bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space is that true
we seem to have different approaches here i was going for helpful honesty i have no idea what you’re doing
okay if you think being nice will get him to shut up i’ll try it
you know what guys never mind i just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again
look at that the problem solved itself
what if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper
you know salt makes me retain water and my cousin william was ground to death in a pepper factory accident how about raggedy ann and andy i loved them growing up
no i don’t think so those dolls represent three things i do not care for clowns children and raggediness i think it’s a lost cause
no there are certain things that say to the world i have a boyfriend and he’s not made up matching costumes hickeys and sex tapes pick one
uhoh is someone a little blue come on howie that’s like the funniest thing i’ve ever said in my life what do you say you ready to go
to tell you the truth i’m not really in the mood
what are you talking about it’ll be fun all your friends’ll be there
yeah some friends they all think i’m boring maybe you should go without me
no if i’m there alone people might think i’m just a really short person from avatar
i’m sorry i just don’t want to go
hey i just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue i’m gonna be washing paint out of my smurf for a month
fine two weeks ago i was an astronaut
yeah well now you’re a smurf keep walking
oh my god you guys look adorable
thanks so do you slutty cop
no sexy cop slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges
ja und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light
i thought we said in the car no accents
oh yes thank you i like to think of fun things like that because i’m fun i’m not clinically depressed at all
hey hey look at you guys
i’m raggedy ann and he’s raggedy c3po
it was a compromise i lost
can you believe stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party
what do you mean who cares look at what i pulled off here the dj’s on fire there’s a tardis photo booth in the back room and oh my god the food stuart wanted kraft draculoni and cheese
you’re right the party’s fantastic please tell me more i haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old
is this about the space thing again
well i’m not allowed to talk about it but since you brought it up i went to space space space space space space space
whoa drinky smurf can i talk to you for a second
great now i’m in trouble you happy
you out you are being very rude
no i’m not they’re all being rude and you’re being rude
oh howie stop talking about space so much nobody likes it
you’re my wife you’re supposed to be on my side
then why are you trying to take this away from me being an astronaut is the coolest thing i’m ever gonna do if i stop talking about it then i’m just…
just plain old howard wolowitz again
plain old howard wolowitz is the best guy i know
no i’m not i married him on purpose come here
nothing to see here just sexy police business
just explaining the theory of relativity twice
i don’t know raj sent me some video of buzz aldrin
try to keep up howard i’m killing it
yeah i wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now
don’t worry this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs
paradigmshifting news gentlemen switches game off
dude i was about to bollywood this bitch
earlier today i invited professor stephen hawking to join me in the popular online game words with friends moments ago he accepted my request do you understand what that means
that somewhere right now stephen hawking is saying damn it i meant to click no”
i’ll walk you through it the game is not called words with strangers no it’s not even called words with acquaintances it is called words with…
i’m not finishing your sentence you pulled the plug on my funk
friends it’s words with friends which stephen hawking and i officially are now all i need is a bunk bed with a slide i’ll have everything i’ve ever wanted since i was six years old
that’s really nice sheldon i’m happy for you
and i’m happy for you too you are now friends with someone who is officially friends with stephen hawking enjoy it boys you may have peaked
sheldon i know stephen hawking i worked with him
and if they ever come out with a game called words with people you once worked with you’ll be off to the races
sheldon i don’t think this actually means…
hold that thought professor hawking has made a move boy oh boy oh it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other i’ll be coop he’ll be wheels if he’s okay with that leaves
all right crank up the ac boys it’s gonna get hot in here
so i was taking a shower this morning and when i got out i started to dry off with what i thought was a towel but turned out to be howard’s mom’s underwear i had to take another shower it wasn’t enough nothing will ever be enough
i once looked in sheldon’s underwear drawer he yelled at me but now i know what it looks like and he can never take that away
i got it why do you have a history textbook
no it’s not a big deal just taking a class at the pasadena community college
that’s great i didn’t know you wanted to go back to school
it’s just one history class look i didn’t finish college so i thought i would give it a try
not to mention your acting career is going south like sherman read about it in your book
why would you be embarrassed to tell us
no i’m not embarrassed i just didn’t want anyone to know because i haven’t told leonard yet
because it’s me going back to school and he’s gonna be all “you can do it” and “how can i help” and “i’m so proud of you” ugh
i just can’t believe you could keep something like that from him
you guys have got to be the weirdest couple i know
really you can’t think of anyone weirder
i can but she’s sitting right there
yes i play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points that ought to let the air out of your tyres hawking
wow my boyfriend is friends with stephen hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn’t smell like tar everything really is coming up amy
it is glorious one of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits and i’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down
you know when one male dominates another his testosterone level rises
it’s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level
ooh my friend stephen just played the word act for 18 points that’s right i call him stephen now because i checked and he was not okay with wheels
oh you could turn his act into extract pronounced with emphasis on act and it would be for double points
amy why would you give me a word now if i play extract it would be cheating
although i could play the completely unrelated and better word extract pronounced with emphasis on ex ethical conundrum avoided thanks brain
it’s crunchy just the way i like it
yeah i don’t think the water was really boiling
okay listen there’s something i need to tell you i’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now so a couple months ago i started taking a history class at the community college
oh that’s great great great great why wait so long to tell me
i don’t want you to make a big deal out of it
why do you think i’d be like that i get it you’re taking one class it’s nice maybe if it goes well you take another you enrol fulltime ooh be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a fouryear college
you’re making it a big deal
anyway that’s it i just thought you should know
am i allowed to ask how the class is going
it’s really good we’ve been talking about the origins of slavery turn in my first paper tomorrow
great topic i can help with that there are lots of different perspectives you can take economic sociological political
hey hey hey this is my paper and my perspective is that slavery is bad oh and my professor’s black so i’m pretty sure that’s the right answer
no leonard this is my thing
it’s like when i started doing chinups i didn’t want you to see until i could do one fyi really close
thank you now behave yourself and eat your dinner maybe later if you’re lucky you get to sleep with a college girl
really ‘cause i went to four years of college and five years of grad school that never happened once
i think the next time i have to speak to a call centre in india i’m going to try using an american accent
because when i use my regular voice i feel like i’m making fun of them
that’s ridiculous not to mention your american accent is terrible
dude my accent is brilliant in american accent hey my snowwhite american friends let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese
this is what you sound like i think i’m talking in an american accent but it really sounds like i’m wearing a set of giant dentures
sheldon do i really sound like that
tell him he sounds like that
it’s been three days why hasn’t stephen hawking played a word
the guy’s a genius maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him
not challenging i was humiliating the man i was thinking of writing a book called a brief history of the time i made stephen hawking cry like a little girl
there’s the problem you can’t beat hawking like that he hates to lose everyone knows the guy’s a big baby i mean forget the wheelchair he should be in a stroller
one time when i was working with him he said that johnny depp was in the matrix i told him he was wrong but he kept insisting so i looked it up online and showed him well the next day he had a pizza party and everyone got invited but me and then he was all your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix
good lord what have i done
good lord what have i done
all right hotshot let’s hear your indian
i can’t sit on that elephant my ass is on fire from eating all this curry
please be good please be good uhhuh uhhuh okay she writes like she cooks
trying to use a jedi mind trick to control stephen hawking play play ugh he must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something
then suffer in silence play play play knock knock knock stephen hawking knock knock knock stephen hawking knock knock knock stephen hawking
penny started taking a class she wrote a paper she didn’t want me to read it i went behind her back and i read it anyway
i don’t know what to do i mean the paper’s terrible but if i tell her she’ll know that i read it and she’ll get really mad
i was beating him so bad he doesn’t want to be friends anymore why does everyone love me except stephen hawking
is it possible we’re having two different conversations
how would i know i’m not listening to you
hang on okay here’s what we’re gonna do chess clock we each get five minutes to talk about our problems we’ll take turns each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend begin
i humiliated stephen hawking in a game of words with friends he stopped playing and now we’re not friends anymore
he’s probably busy you’re worried about nothing give it a couple more days i’m sure he’ll play and you’ll see that everything’s fine my turn i can’t let penny hand in a bad paper but how do i tell her it’s bad without letting her know that i read it
hmm beats me now i know hawking’s not busy because i can see he’s playing other people right now
maybe since you’re so good he’s taking his time to meet the challenge i want penny to enjoy school…
wolowitz told me he’s a big baby but i didn’t know that and i played extract for 82 points it’s all amy’s fault she told me to play it i have got to cut her loose
sheldon i wasn’t done talking she hands in the paper tomorrow i know i could help her and she’s my girlfriend i i should be allowed to help her why aren’t i allowed to help her
no you need to give me some advice
leonard wait no i listened to your dumb thing leonard come back leonard come back leonard come back
oh of course it only works on the weakminded
leonard it’s eight am it’s like the middle of the night
i know but i have to go to work and i made you breakfast
oh wow that’s so sweet hey what’s this
uh before you open that um are you familiar with the story of the shoemaker and the elves
elves come on leonard it’s too early for lord of the rings
no no listen um once upon a time there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him and when the shoemaker woke up in the morning he he would be super happy not mad at the elves at all open it
okay an examination of the economic cultural and political roots of slavery in the old south 1619 to 1865 what the hell is this
don’t ask me a little elf did it
so let me get this straight you just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me
no i assumed it would be good then i read it
no i i mean it was good there were just a few things that needed a little polishing
that’s not true uh slavery 1619 your name at the top that’s all you
you are such an ass this is exactly why i didn’t want to tell you i was taking a class in the first place
please don’t be upset i just i didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school
right because me being in school is so important to you that way you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress
oh come on you know that’s not true
do i listen to me i need to do this on my own if i fail i fail if i pass i pass do you get it
i’m sorry i was just trying to help
yeah well next time don’t oh and since you like stories so much this is not the shoemaker
you ever hear back from hawking
no it would appear as if i’ve lost him stupid brain
how can it be okay stephen hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot it’s everything i’ve ever wanted in a friend
yeah but if he’s a sore loser maybe you’re better off without him
you’re right i guess i just have to make lemonade out of the two of you he played he played coop and rolling thunder are together again he was okay with that nickname
so now all you have to do is let him win
yeah way ahead of you i will play the word at for two measly points throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world
what are you waiting for hit send
i can’t losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest
oh but i want to be hawking’s friend
oh but if i do i’ll be a phony a sellout a hollywood poser
i won’t this feels right my mother always said to thine own self be true
‘course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat so what does she know and send
oh hey haven’t heard from you in a couple days you still mad at me
nope i have no reason to… “b” mad at you minus
that’s right on my paper not yours mine you punkass elf
i don’t know what to say
hmm how about gee penny you’re smarter than i thought you may be the one in school but i’m the one who learned a lesson i’m so stupid penny duh
i don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again
so i know this goes without saying but if either of you tell leonard you helped me rewrite this paper i will beat you both with a bag of oranges
now ladies we got a bminus on this paper i think if we put our heads together on the next one we could get an a
uh but we got you a bminus on purpose to make it believable
believable you saying i’m not smart
i feel like i’m in high school again
yeah doing the prom queen’s homework so she’ll like us
well answer it i want to hear
professor hawking how nice of you to call
hello i really enjoyed our game dr cooper
or should i say dr loser ha ha ha
yes congratulations you won fair and square uh very impressive sir
what does sheldon cooper and a black hole have in common they both suck neener neener
hello i’m dr sheldon cooper welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags before we get started i’d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition but i can’t the only entry was from gameygamer75 and i know that was a jpeg of your buttocks now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise star trek and to help me i’m pleased to introduce internet personality former star of star trek
hi sheldon thanks for having me i’m happy to be here
sorry sheldon you were brilliant as always wil that was a little wooden
don’t worry it wasn’t terrible just this time try to say it the way people sound and action
hi sheldon thanks for having me i’m excited to be here
so wil what do you have for us first
well this is an exciting one this is the flag of the united federation of planets now what’s interesting about this flag…
it’s called fun with flags they’re not at halfmast nobody died let’s try and keep it upbeat
um no offence but i’ve been acting since i was a kid i think i can handle a web show without a lot of direction
it’s true in 1982 wil played the voice of martin the mouse in the secret of nimh you moved me
you’ll have to forgive me this is my first time directing i just want it to be good
great so this time let’s try more real boy less pinocchio and action
and cut you realize that i’m doing this for free right
yes and so far we’re still not getting our money’s worth let’s try it again everybody’s having fun and action
so wil what do you have for us first
well this is an exciting one this is the flag of the united federation of planets
oh none that i could see i saw a man who loved flags almost as much as i do i got goose bumps
really he reminded me of a young william shatner
listen sheldon i’m really happy to do this for you but not if she’s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time
you gonna let him speak to me like that
well you’re my girlfriend and i don’t want you to be upset then again wil wheaton’s my friend and i don’t want him to be upset hmm this is a sticky wicket to wil what do you think
can i speak to you for a second
i’ll be right back feel free to play with yourself
i don’t care for your friend he’s being rude to me you need to ask him to leave
amy i can’t just ask wil wheaton to leave he’s a minor celebrity once you explain who he is many people recognize him
fine then maybe i should go
could you that would solve everything you are the best i’ll see you at dinner tonight
you sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend wil wheaton
come to think of it i would you little lady are on fire
every time we eat dinner here your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes
don’t take it personally she likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking
yeah let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks
i don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home
what are you talking about all i have here is a few sweaters books bank stuff computers mail collectibles medicine and my electric body groomer ooh there’s my plaid dickie oh got this at the goodwill store for 50 cents can you believe it
50 cents sounds right let’s go
you know it’s kinda late why don’t we just spend the night here
do you you said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment but half the time we stay here
howard i’m doing laundry you want me to put anything in for you
there’s some underwear in the hamper
oh good i got that new stain stick to try out
thank you i only put it on the list two weeks ago okay i see what you’re getting at how about this weekend i’ll box up all my things and move them to our place
the lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room
or in the closet we can decide later
howard help my hand’s stuck in the garbage disposal
let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding
are you kidding it’s a perfectly good chicken leg
hey look who’s out after dark like a big boy
i was out raising heck with mr wil wheaton four hours more and we would have closed down the hometown buffet
i thought you had plans with amy
yeah i did but then wil called amy a pain in the ass she got huffy and left then wil and i headed out to dinner that place really did remind me of my hometown because there we also have a hometown buffet
hold on wil and amy had an argument
then amy got mad and left
enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price the manager recognized wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine right next to it i was closer to it than i am to you right now
buddy i think amy might be upset
because your friend was rude to her and then you went to dinner with him
you’re just repeating what i said it’s like living with a lactoseintolerant parrot
fine it’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt i was this close
you’ll appreciate this leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me tell him you’re not mad at me go ahead set him straight
hmm eat one of your luna bars very often when women think they’re angry they’re really just hungry
i’m not hungry your friend insulted me and you didn’t do anything
precisely i didn’t do anything now does someone feel like checking her emotional math
keep going buddy you’re doing great

so is there anything i can do to help you with the move tomorrow
now that you mention it i was thinking tomorrow might not be great
no excuse it’s just you know i’m jewish and technically we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the sabbath so this one’s on god
that might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger
my religion’s kinda looseygoosey basically as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross you’re good
i will i’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life i’m not a child

that was just for her benefit i’ll move tomorrow i love you don’t leave me
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock angry amy
i’ve been thinking about what happened and i hope this gift will make things better
star trek dvds why would i want this
first of all you’re welcome and furthermore not being familiar with wil wheaton’s body of work there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure get ready for 130 hours of i told you so she hands him back the dvds and slams the door fine i’ll just tell you what happens episode one encounter at farpoint fade in the new enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the bandi people of deneb iv enter wesley crusher played by my buddy… amy opens door grabs dvds slams door again she’s hooked
wow an end of an era
boy if these walls could talk
they’d say why does he touch himself so much
yeah i can’t believe i’m not going to live here anymore this has always been my bedroom right here is where my mom used to mark my height
oh yeah fifth grade sixth grade seventh grade eighth grade ninth grade
i remember when i was five hiding under this desk with all my halloween candy had some peanut mm’s went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital came home celebrated with a snickers went into my second anaphylactic shock
when did you figure out you were allergic to nuts
sometime around the third almond joy
okay you want to start loading this stuff into the truck
yeah i guess hey would you do me a favour go on ahead i just want one last moment alone in my old room
we’re not standing outside by the uhaul while you fondle yourself
penny if you wouldn’t mind i’d like to have a conversation about girls
i had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later are you finally getting fuzz in weird places
penny please i’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma and for the record i had a full pubis of hair by the time i was 19
and for the record bleugh so what are you drinking
well it’s been a rough day i usually go chamomile tea but i don’t think that’s going to cut it
you could have a long island iced tea
it’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times
oh so the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble
the trouble isn’t with me penny it’s with your gender someday scientists will discover that second x chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle
yeah amy told me what happened look just apologize it’ll warm her twaddle
it’s a bandaid at best see the core problem is that amy and wil do not like each other which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me and i like them which indicates they’re bright and interesting andor were on star trek
honey you can’t make people like each other
not true leonard made me like you and let me tell you that was a hard row to hoe cheers pal ooh boy that is a treat that’s hard to beat get the mad hatter on the horn i’m having a tea party
you might want to pace yourself
i drink tea all the time i think i know what i’m doing
far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis look sheldon your problem is not wil wheaton okay your problem is the way you treated amy
my problem is i’m out of tea
come on someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it i thought you texas guys stood up for your womenfolk
penny please i think i’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing
on the other hand that lowdown polecat done wronged my woman
amy deserves better you know when we buy the planter’s deluxe mix she eats all the brazil nuts so i don’t have to look at them she’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel
yeah that she is here you go
i’m a callous egomaniac she’s gonna leave me
okay i have now officially moved out of my mother’s house you are now the only woman in my life who i’ll see naked in the bathroom
i know this wasn’t easy you doing okay
oh i’m fine it’s just her i’m worried about
aw she’ll be okay she’s a grown woman
i know it’s just ever since my dad left i’ve felt responsible for her
that’s a lot for a kid to deal with
she was just so sad all the time i was the only person who could cheer her up well me and ben and jerry
you know she’s why i first got into magic i would do little shows for her hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain put on a top hat and cape and part way through the act i would say i needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage i can still remember the way she’d smile for a few minutes she’d forget how lonely she was
grab a box we’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight
no but i want to live here
well you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story
no husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart
knock knock knock wil wheaton knock knock knock wil wheaton wait how many was that
just tea s’the best tea i’ve ever had
i’ll tell you i’m from texas need i say more
yeah actually a little more would be helpful
you insulted my woman i’m here to defend her honour two it was two knock knock knock wil wheaton now prepare yourself for what may come
oh sheldon do you really think we’re gonna fight
my fists are not up here because i’m milking a giant invisible cow they’re up to beat an apology out of you
well that was a long bus ride for not very much
you’re asking a lot of questions wil wheaton as a matter of idle curiosity which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting never mind i’ll choose vomits you were so good in stand by me
hello i’m dr sheldon cooper welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise star trek and to help us i’m pleased to introduce a special guest surprisingly it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here mr levar burton
hey sheldon it’s a pleasure to be here well we’ve got some interesting flags for…
cut yikes this guy is worse than wil wheaton
i don’t know what she’s talking about but i’m obligated to agree with her she’s my girlfriend
ah i hear you brother i still get lunch right
what are you drawing over there
it’s a hypothetical containment field for a frisbeesized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe
you know a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other lifeforms would probably not end well for us
it’s a frisbeesized wormhole leonard you can block it with a frisbee calm down hands howard the napkin
do you expect me to build this
i expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin gentlemen
have you guys ever noticed that sheldon always disappears every day at two fortyfive
he probably just goes to the bathroom
actually no he goes to the bathroom at eight am with optional followups at one fortyfive and seven ten highfibre fridays
it’s sad that you know that
oh that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg
i’m looking at his public calendar two fortyfive to threeohfive nothing yesterday two fortyfive to threeohfive nothing last week nothing last month nothing he never has anything booked during that time
twenty minutes a day completely unaccounted for
we should figure out where he goes
ooh this is exciting like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties
right the case of who murdered three saturday nights of my life
colonel koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread
it was tapenade and you guys suck
well i spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection
oh just this guy i met at school
oh great we’re still dating right
relax he’s just a friend we’re doing an oral report together he’s really nice
i’m sorry what was that i had a little stroke after oral
would you stop look he just moved here from london okay he doesn’t really know anybody
oh good an english accent the sexiest accent you can have
no that’s not true there’s french there’s italian no you’re right it’s the best
did you tell him you have a boyfriend
well maybe you should tell him
what am i supposed to say
say can’t talk right now hanging with my boyfriend england sucks you suck usa number one
fine hanging with my boyfriend talk to you later happy
did your boyfriend make you type that
come on trust me he’s hitting on you
no he’s not we’re just friends look is this gonna be a problem because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work
if it makes you uncomfortable i’ll switch partners even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and i’ll probably end up failing the class
two fortyfour right on schedule hey sheldon
raj and i are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glowinthedark bunny want to come with us
are you sure they turn off the lights and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place
well it’s your word against mine see you in court
i don’t know i’m torn i want to know where he’s going but now i kind of want to play with the bunny
hey alex do you know where your boss just went
all i know is corduroy makes too much noise and i have to go find quieter pants
boy what i wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish
this is where he goes what’s in there
i think it’s an old storage room
what could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes
well he’s not doing twentyminute abs because if he were he would have way better abs can you hear anything
not yet what are you doing
can’t you face the other way and listen
i can’t do anything right for you can i
what the hell is he up to
he is kind of a weirdo maybe he’s got leonard nimoy chained up in there or bill gates or stephen hawking
why would he chain up stephen hawking
howard please you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled that’s not okay
if you’re wondering why i’ve been staring through the peephole i’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to penny’s
to be honest i didn’t know you were here
it’s not a big deal he’s just in her history class they’re working on a project together i don’t even know why i care you know what i don’t care
this is silly i have nothing to worry about
oh i don’t know i mean statistically speaking i’m sure you have something to worry about
well if we assume your looks are average yeah right off the bat fifty percent of men on earth are more attractive than you that’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by waiting to rain on your parade
well yeah but this isn’t just about looks i’m i’m way above average in a lot of other things
not height vision athleticism or ability to digest dairy products
i’m talking about important things like emotional maturity
you were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole
i liked it better when you thought i wasn’t here
i’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities your choice of friends is impeccable you’re a good sleeper and last but not least you buy the grapes i like you’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes
none of this matters i trust that penny cares about me and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy
well unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist
while unlikely it’s still a statistical possibility she might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it
am i the mind’s a mysterious thing leonard he could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn
look at us sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars
i think we’re more like ninjas
i don’t want to be a ninja i want to be a cat burglar
fine i’ll be a ninja you be a cat burglar
no we both have to be the same thing okay we’re ninjas
but next time we’ll be cat burglars
yes i’m sure now you stand guard i’m going to…
just keep an eye out i’ll have this open in a minute
when did you learn how to pick locks
when i was starting to do magic in junior high i thought i could be an escape artist like harry houdini
pretty good i managed to escape friends popularity and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius there ready
sheldon is a very smart man and he obviously wants to keep this a secret
don’t worry i’m one step ahead of him
great what’s your pl… howard pushes him inside
yeah huh fortythree what the hell does that mean
i don’t know the solution to an equation
maybe it’s a prime number encryption systems are built on prime numbers
what kind of secret does sheldon have to encrypt
he’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty
really well oh okay one mystery solved
thanks cole see you at school
i thought you left a long time ago
you uh moving into the apartment on the fifth floor
no i was just visiting a friend
oh cool that cute blonde on four
i well i see her around i like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude
she told me he’s a scientist
that’s the name of his gang the scientists they are crazy
no problem brother stay frosty cole leaves leonard spots penny watching we’re still dating right
hey alex and call me leonard dr hofstadter is my father and my mother and my sister and our cat although i’m pretty sure dr boots hofstadter’s degree was honorary
hey alex let me ask you something my girlfriend knows this guy at school he’s got an english accent
yeah you all do anyway i feel like he’s hitting on her she says he’s just being nice and that i should trust her
it’s probably harmless you know how it is i’m sure you get hit on all the time
right because girls are always like ooh that guy owns two star trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections i got to get me some of that
i don’t know i bet it happens more than you realize
you sure you’re cute you’re funny maybe you’re getting hit on and you don’t even know it
okay i got to get back to work thanks for listening
hopehope no girls rip my clothes off on the way
come on we’re smart guys we can figure this out
fortythree what is fortythree besides my mom’s neck size
it’s the atomic number for technetium
do you think he’s building a bomb
ah it took him two years to put together that lego death star i’m not worried
ooh this could be something fortythree is the number of calories in half a cup of fatfree yoghurt
i’m sorry we can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin wait in the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy isn’t fortythree the answer to the question of life the universeand everything
yeah me too we’ve got more important things to do who cares what stupid fortythree means
let’s go home you want to get something to eat
hey shouldn’t you be out with your gang spray painting equations on the side of buildings
i just can’t believe you don’t trust me
i do of course i do
then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend who by the way knew exactly who you were
oh you know i’m really starting to not like this guy
what is your problem do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home
i don’t know ititit’s hard sometimes everywhere you go guys hit on you even if i’m standing right there and they’re all taller than me why is everyone taller than me you know what this is all in my head it’s my problem not yours
leonard why do you always do this listen to me you’re the one i’m with you know i love you so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy
you know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me
we’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal
that’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry and we both know if i start crying you’re gonna start crying
she loves me receives text hey it’s alex nice having coffee with you if you want to talk more i’m always available smiley face smiley face what a friendly girl
okay picture’s up looks like the camera’s working
it better be it’s the spare camera for the mars rover
how did you get your hands on that
million dollar camera ten dollar lock
oh my god here he comes this is it
what the hell is that thing
this is dr sheldon cooper experimental log wormhole generator test fortyfour
wormhole generator test on screen a wormhole appears
the first fortythree parallel universes i’ve checked proved to be empty i see no reason to suspect universe number fortyfour will be any different puts his head in the wormhole
i found your webcam and replaced the video feed you two should be ashamed of yourselves
sorry you may not realize it but i have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life you know understanding sarcasm feigning interest in others not talking about trains as much as i want to it’s exhausting which is why for twenty minutes a day i like to go down to that room turn my mind off and do what i need to do to recharge
but what are you doing in there
you don’t need to know you don’t deserve to know and you will never know
yeah well i know how to make your egg salad now
one two three four five six seven eight… drat i’m never going to get to fortythree again one two three four… rats
your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data you’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness
no you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter mummies and zombies are the exact same thing
oh yeah mummies are wrapped in bandages
all right you brought this on yourself sheldon get him
if a zombie bites you you turn into a zombie however if a mummy bites you all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite so like a zombie that’s been eaten from the waist down you sir have no leg to stand on
oh they’re not the same thing
thanks guess who picked up his new car this morning
congratulations does it have that new car smell
yep for as long as i can keep my mother out of it if you want to check it out later it’s parked right out front space 294
why do you have a parking spot you don’t have a car you don’t even drive
it doesn’t matter that’s my spot
maybe they reassigned it because you never use it
well i’m not using my nipples either maybe they should reassign those
sheldon someday if you get a car i’m sure they’ll give you another parking space
i don’t want another parking space i want my parking space it’s perfect it’s a corner spot cutting the risk of doordings in half it’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance the nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks
fun story meanwhile you still don’t have a car
don’t try to change the subject this is about a parking space it has nothing to do with cars
i always listen to myself it’s one of the great joys of my life now get your car out of my spot
very well you leave me no choice
what are you looking at you stupid squirrel
president siebert listen to reason yeah i understand i don’t use the parking spot but that’s not the point i… yes i’m aware you told me not to call you at home but you didn’t answer the door and i know you were there because i saw you through the mail slot yeah well that’s some salty language may i remind you that you’re the president of a major university not the president of the potty mouth club there it is again do you kiss your mother with that mouth oh well i’m sorry for your loss good night sir unbelievable he says wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a highprofile asset to the university
well he’s not wrong howard did go to the international space station
yeah that was five weeks ago how much longer is he gonna milk that cow
sheldon let it go it’s not a big deal
no no this is a slippery slope leonard it starts with a parking space where does it end it’s like my dad always said first they say you can’t drink and drive next thing you know you can’t let your 10yearold take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat
all that story does is make me feel bad for your mother
leonard you’re my best friend why don’t you ever take my side
because i can never understand your side
i’m sorry but could you be more specific
my iron man helmet koothrappali saw you take it give it back
oh that well see i wanted it and you weren’t using it apparently those are the rules we live by now payback it truly is the b word isn’t it
sheldon that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible and i want it back
i’d love to help you out but unfortunately puts helmet on i’m using it
go ahead that’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get it smells funny in here
we’re so proud of you amy your first bikini wax
a little sensitive but not bad does it always take that long
uh no they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax
i feel like i’m five pounds lighter
okay so did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight too
for hours fortunately i couldn’t understand most of it ’cause sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask
howard was so angry i had to mash up benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep
i guess this is what we get for being with two testosteronefueled alpha males at some point they’re bound to lock horns
i’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at comiccon
i’m really sorry they took sheldon’s spot away he shouldn’t have to suffer just because howard’s such a big deal now
i know sheldon should just let howard have his little moment in the sun
well i mean howard’s never gonna go to space again but sheldon will always be a genius
you’re right and i’m sure sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science
okay maybe we should change the subject um amy how are your lady parts still chilly down there
hang on none of sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven my husband actually went to outer space
that’s an impressive accomplishment he’s now an inspiration to millions of americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space
you know i remember the first time i got a bikini wax my sister did it with melted crayolas and duct tape it’s a bad idea
gosh amy i’m sensing a little hostility is it maybe because like sheldon’s work your sex life is also theoretical
yeah well at least when we do make love sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother and yes that is a cleverly veiled reference to howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb
anyway to this day i still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs
i don’t have to take this i’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now maybe i’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot which sounds dirty but i didn’t mean it that way
well i’m not giving it away enters apartment howard is sitting naked in his spot with a laptop on his lap
he’s in my spot leonard make him stop being naked in my spot
he wasn’t using it and i needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on
give me back my iron man helmet
give me back my parking space
you don’t need a parking space you don’t have a car
you don’t need an iron man helmet you’re not iron man
well we appear to have reached an impasse and you know i have to say i thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk
i didn’t pick up on that that’s a nice touch
this is so exciting i’m feeling all tingly although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone
keep a lookout this place is swarming with campus security they will not hesitate to scold us
oh yeah okay now pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here
wait i’m leaving my car here
yes and be sure and put on the emergency brake really makes these things tough to budge
before i park come in the back seat i want to show you something i had done today
i think you’re high on paint fumes and boy that’s a lot of bandaids
okay howard’s mother is in like every one of your wedding photos
what can i tell ya she’s a big girl wherever you look there she is more coffee
no leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture and coffee’ll just keep me awake knock on door oh i’ll get it
oh looks like someone’s on team bernadette where’s howard
he had my car towed it cost me two hundred dollars to get it back
oh no where was it parked
that doesn’t make sense sheldon doesn’t have a spot was it maybe in howard’s spot
don’t play dumb with me sister you tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars
well that doesn’t make sense either
because i’m the one who had it towed
didn’t see that one coming did ya
oh yeah well you’re not gonna see this coming swings handbag bernadette ducks penny is hit in the face
you idiot what the hell do you have in there
just my wallet keys and a coffee can full of change i’ve been meaning to take to the bank
don’t move i’ll get some ice
get away from me or i swear to god i will rip out what’s left of your pubes
amy you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand
i do penny bernadette and i are sorry
you hit her what did i do
you were parked in howard’s spot
i was parked in sheldon’s spot
guys i think i need to go to the emergency room
i’ll drive you can see where the tow truck scratched my car
the tow truck didn’t scratch your car
morning professor stevens don’t look at that whiteboard that’s my math not your math keep walking nosey
what the hell are you doing
oh you said i’m not using my space so i’m using it
okay you need to move now
actually i have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says i can give up wolowitz you’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat there is nothing you could possibly do to… howard starts sounding his horn sheldon puts on earphones
those aren’t gonna help you sheldon
oh yes they are i mean what
your threats are empty nothing can move me howard starts pushing his chair with the front of the car stop that
no that’s it i am calling campus security you prepare for the scolding of your life
he’s trying to kill me leonard video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence
would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate
you’re both acting like lunatics it’s just a parking spot
it’s not just a parking spot he can’t handle the fact that i’m a bigger deal than he is now
oh preposterous i have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations i have changed the way we think about boseeinstein condensates and i am also the one who got nutter butters in the cafeteria vending machine maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space now if you’ll excuse me i have work to do
what i don’t believe is that you tried to run him over
oh like you’ve never thought of doing that don’t hate me just because i lived the dream horn beeps sheldon is sitting naked in howard’s car
what are you doing in there
just breaking in your new car
you know what they say revenge is a dish best served nude
oh of course come in raj opens door to reveal howard this is an authentic chinese throwing star and i must warn you i have seen many people throw them in movies
calm down howard has something he wants to say to you
all right sheldon when this whole thing with the parking space started i had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…
howard that’s not how we practiced it
i had no idea how much that spot meant to you anyway i called president siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot so you keep it and i’ll park in the structure across the street
well howard thank you it’s quite a gesture on your part you’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man
which i find totally unacceptable i must be the bigger man therefore you may use my spot until such time as i learn to drive or get a batmobile
wow okay well thanks i don’t know what to say
there is nothing to say except i’m the bigger man i’m not kidding say it
oh stop and i believe this is yours fyi if you wear that into a bank they will tackle you to the ground
i’d like to propose a toast to burying the hatchet
you know i’m kind of glad this happened
me too in some weird way i kind of feel like it brought us closer
yes according to information i gleaned from yelp you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood i believe i may have a similar problem this cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle
a naked man sat on it now here’s my concern his diet is rich in fatty deli meats what test do you have to detect lipid residue
lipid residue an anal autograph a colon calling card if you will
don’t rush it we may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level
let me write you a ticket
looks like that laptop’s seen better days if you’re interested i’m selling this it’s only two years old 16 gigabytes of ram intel core i7 processor and i can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis
is anyone else troubled by the spiderman theme song
why would it trouble you it’s like your third favourite cartoon theme song
it is right behind dododododo inspector gadget and teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a halfshell
however the spiderman lyrics posit that spiderman spiderman does whatever a spider can
i can think of many things spiderman can’t do that a spider can one crawl in your ear and die two legally leave guatemala without a passport three have sex with a spider
an we change the subject spiders give me the jeebiejeebies
i know but that sounds antisemitic anyway i was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight the theme movies that killed their franchises
oh like jaws 4 indiana jones 4 daredevil 1
not me i’m having dinner with bernadette and her parents
fun we know how much you love that
it’s torture especially with her dad we have nothing in common
you know what i like to do when i’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station i bring up an interesting topic like the difference between spiderman and spiders
thanks sheldon i’ll try that with my fatherinlaw
no you can’t use that one that’s mine uh try this one for an icebreaker uh despite popular lore there is no place in the continental united states alaska or hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in china
actually you can’t have that one either it’s too good sorry
what about you sheldon do you have any plans tonight
sadly yes amy’s taking me to a memorial service it’s for one of her colleagues who is of asian descent so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave he’ll never make his way back to china
what can i say i put the fun in funeral
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy oh right funeral knock knock knock solemnly amy
i’m not allowed to wear my silver surfer neck tie but you can wear a bathrobe
i think i’m too sick to go to the funeral
you’re sick you poor kid well see ya
sheldon aren’t you gonna take care of me
me no no i’m not that kind of doctor
but our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick the other must take care of them
oh no i see the confusion no the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when i’m ill when you’re feeling better you’ll think that’s funny
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy i made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this additionally you are my girlfriend and i care about your wellbeing
you’re welcome now let’s get this over with
good fine is good how you liking retirement
i’m sensing a theme you ever really think about the spiderman theme song how’s that dinner coming
i just put it in it’s gonna be a while
i like rare chicken let’s do this
death by chicken that’s a pretty fowl way to go
so mrs rostenkowski you took that trip to the grand canyon how was it
had no idea you were the chatty one
1022 exactly what it was half an hour ago it’s like you’re not even trying to get better
sheldon you don’t get over the flu in half an hour
i have to say i’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking
i’m sorry i just want you to get better as soon as possible and with that goal in mind let me ask you a question do you believe in the placebo effect
of course i do there have been many studies proving its validity
great now this may look like a tic tac but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath
sheldon this isn’t helping why don’t you just let me get some rest
how can you sleep i’m not done making you feel better i still have to put a cold rag on your head sing to you and apply vaporub to your chest
you you want to rub something on my chest
maybe we should start with that
now you’re being a responsible patient now you may notice some tingling
hold up bless us o lord for these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through christ our lord amen
took the words right out of my mouth
so dad have you done any fishing lately
sure i can hear it in your voice
oh if he didn’t like it he wouldn’t go
you know i hadn’t thought of that to bernadette whispering help me
hey dad maybe you could take howard fishing sometime give you guys a chance to get to know each other better
no no we know each other well enough he’s been talking my ear off all night
howie i think you’d have fun
terrific my two favorite fellas gone fishin’
well hang on a second bernie next weekend we have that thing
oh that thing no i cancelled that thing
all right it’s settled you and i are going fishing
great to bernadette thanks for the help
i’ve never even been fishing this is gonna be a disaster
if you don’t want to look foolish doing something you should practice do you know how many beef wellingtons i made by myself before i invited you guys over i’ll give you a hint you can see them here here and here
raj is probably right you should get someone to give you some pointers
do either of you guys know how to fish
no but if you catch anything i know how to steam it in banana leaves
come on we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this
okay right there ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your fatherinlaw it’s right up there with icky and get it away now pick one up
you’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing
i don’t know for them to die of natural causes
just pick up a worm and put him on this hook
i’m no expert but i think the hook has to go through the worm
fine sorry mr worm sherm sherm the worm
hey don’t name him just jab a hook in his face
yeah come on howard hook that worm
that’s great cheerleading way to man things up
and the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities but because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet they lived inconclusively ever after the end
that was great rub my chest again knock at door
no i need to get you down for a nap and for some reason that vaporub gets you all fired up opens door
oh i’m hanging in there thanks for asking
okay amy i brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab this is proving really good for congestion but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid so if you take it happy thoughts
uh i’m going to draw you a soothing bath where’s your bath thermometer
i don’t have a bath thermometer
fine then i’m going to draw you a nervewracking bath of indeterminate temperature
this is a really good expectorant although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music
okay okay here’s the deal i don’t need your medicine i’m not sick
i got better two days ago it’s just been so nice having sheldon take care of me
so you’ve just been lying to him
see the stuff in my nose rubber cement
i don’t mean to be judgy but this is the kind of thing lunatics do
amy would you be strong enough to bathe yourself or do you need my help
i’ll tell him tomorrow mama needs a bath
now let’s assume by some miracle you actually catch a fish you’re going to have to know how to gut it so what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife slice him right up the belly howard gags you want me to stop
all right now you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts or the blood will just squirt all over your face howard leonard and raj gag oh my god what is with you guys
it’s not our fault our dads never did anything like this with us
my dad was an anthropologist the only fatherson time he spent was with a 2000yearold skeleton of an etruscan boy i hated that kid
mine just took me to his gynecology office i got so bored i’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend i was iceskating
yeah well my quality fatherson time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday
you know maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up but right now there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip
you’re right oh i should do this
great here you go what you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat grab the guts and pull
oh look it’s a female you can see all the eggs all the guys gag
oh sheldon am i glad you’re back taking a turn for the worst i think i’m going to need another bath
i’m surprised to hear that see the other day i was concerned that you weren’t recovering so while you were sleeping i took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab
i got the results back have you developed any of the following symptoms a growing nose or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region also known as fullblown liar liar pants on fire
all right all right but i really was sick at the beginning it’s just been so nice having you take care of me
it hurts that you would lie to me amy i thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour
i feel terrible i did this
it pains me to say it but i think some form of penalty is in order so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future
i suppose that’s fair what do you suggest
in a perfect world i’d lock you in a stockade in the public square that probably requires a permit
i could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next star trek movie
oh that seems overly harsh i mean you gave in to a human weakness you didn’t kill a man you know it’s a tad oldschool but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey
are you saying you want to spank me
i don’t want to but it looks like you left me no choice
that’s true i’ve been a very bad girl
hiho hiho it’s off to fish we go
no good the guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear
wish i had known that before i posted all those pictures on facebook
all right let’s hit the road i wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning
i like using a big shell you can’t eat them afterwards but it’s fun watching them blow up
sir i’m flattered that you invited me and i really want you to like me but i don’t think this trip is the way to do it and i can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them
so why’d you agree to come
i tried to back out too my wife said i had to go
really your wife makes you do stuff you’re a big scary cop
you’re an astronaut and your wife makes you do things and she’s only four feet tall
so what do we do now they expect us to go away for the weekend
ah there’s an indian casino near palm springs you know how to shoot craps
no but i’m not a stranger to dice games i was the temple bethel hebrew school yahtzee champion
mazel tov i’ll teach you how to play
okay oh boy we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters huh mike
that’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about
are you prepared to receive your punishment
one second i want to put on some music
i don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me
very well then get over my knee let’s begin
excuse me you’re not supposed to be enjoying this
then maybe you should spank me harder
okay now holding sides of hearth in position lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs
look at that i built a fireplace with my own two hands
aw i got a little paper cut
of course you did your hands are softer than veal
oh before i forget saturday i’m planning a little dungeons and dragons night with the guys
really that’s how you’re gonna spend your saturday night
oh come on i hardly ever get a chance to play anymore
oh you poor thing is having a reallife girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games
oh great i’ve always wanted to play dungeons and dragons
yeah oh i’m sorry i should’ve mentioned this earlier you’re not invited
amy from time to time we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves
by rolling dice and playing makebelieve with little figurines
yeah like a bunch of savages
saturday night but i’ve been working late all week that was gonna be our night
but i have to go we play as a group ifif i’m not there then everyone will blame you they’ll be all bernadette ruined everything she’s the worst so you see i have to play dungeons and dragons for the marriage
so listen i know we talked about getting a bite to eat in silver lake and then seeing the christmas lights in griffith park but leonard’s talking about a big d and d game at his place
saturday night just went from crazy to epic woohoo
all right sheldon to start our quest you need to open this little christmas gift i got you
a christmas gift you know i don’t enjoy christmas
oh where to begin trees indoors overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas and the absurd custom of one stocking everyone knows socks belong in pairs who uses one sock
oh a scroll i like scrolls they’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word after stone tablets and skywriting you have all been summoned to join a thrilling dungeons and dragons adventure your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred i like where this is heading your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres oh that’s a saucy twist that leader’s name santa claus no no no
it’s actually ho ho ho but you’ll get the hang of it thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme
fun mixing dungeons and dragons with christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly the besttasting jelly and petroleum jelly the worsttasting jelly
okay here we go you find yourselves in the smoking remains of santa’s village clearly a great battle has taken place
oh man the first monster i see i’m gonna sneak up behind him whip out my wand and shoot my magic all over his ass
do you hear yourself when you say these things
okay there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow sheldon what do you do
i signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy
fine howard what do you do
i follow the ogre tracks checking for secret doors along the way
and you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor
okay guys let’s make a plan spell casters in the back warriors in the front
no screw that noise i’m going in hang on santa i’m coming for you
okay you run into a room full of weapons hit a trip wire a cannon blows your face off you die you’re out of the game
but a cannon am i really out of the game
wait doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection because if you’ve got one i need it bad get in here with your rod and give it to me
okay you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud
hey guys i don’t mean to interrupt your little game but i thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on so bernadette bernadette’s wearing leopardprint pumps and a racktastic red dress from forever 21 and there’s amy showing all kinds of ankle in an outfit i’m assuming is from forever 63 and i myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty
i know they’re making a rhetorical point i just don’t know what it is
see you boys we are going drinking
uh wait can i come with you my character died
sorry raj it’s girls’ night out
ooh girls’ night girls’ night ooh ooh
how does he not hear that
so what’s the plan are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk luring strange men into the bathroom and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses
can we get another bottle of champagne for the table don’t worry it’s my treat
wow you should come to girls’ night more often and not just because if you weren’t here this would be a can of pabst
my pleasure nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady just ask my dog my vet says if i give her any more foie gras she’s going to die of gout
hey let’s help raj meet a girl tonight
okay wait are we talking onenight stand or do we want to get him into a relationship
stop it you’re ruining girls’ night
raj you’re a great guy you’re in a bar full of single women let us help you
yeah you’re a real catch i know you’re shy but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life
that’s sweet of you but what can you do to help
we’ll nose around see if we can find a nice girl and then introduce you
okay well a couple of things don’t tell them i come from money i want them to love me for me they must be insanely hot like nines or tens
okay an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub
bottom line you’ll take any woman who’ll have you right
i don’t remember you buying these miniatures in my store
oh uh yeah i got ’em on amazon
sure i get it why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend
i know but when i shop online i can do it on the toilet
have you seen my store the whole place is a toilet
can we please move this along
yeah sorry uh you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest what do you do and howard do not say i feel up the large chest
excuse me i’m a married man now i wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile
i walk up to the large chest bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”
it’s locked but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in
that’s not good my character and i both have claustrophobia
glowing letters appear on the chest that read if squashed to death you wish not to be sing of svaty vaclav and his victory
who the hell is svaty vaclav
oh boy happy place happy place
wait svaty vaclav was the duke of bohemia
you’re ten seconds away from getting crushed nine eight
what are we supposed to do
wait wait svaty vaclav is better known as good king wenceslas from the beloved victorian christmas carol
never heard of it must be the one christmas song not written by a jewish guy
good king wenceslas looked out on the feast of stephen when the snow lay ’round about deep and crisp and even
brightly shone the moon that night though the frost was cruel when a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel
it was simple i combined a wellknown historical fact about bohemia with the memory of my grandparents meemaw and poppop singing christmas carols while i sat in front of the fire and tried to build a highenergy particle accelerator out of legos
wwwait there’s still four more verses you don’t sing a song and not finish it hither page and stand by me if thou know’st it telling yonder peasant who is he where and what his dwelling brightly shone the moon that night though the frost…
looks like he’s doing pretty good
of course he is look that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend she’s angry she’s drunk and her favorite movie is slumdog millionaire i mean
great i bought her a couple of drinks and she gave me her email address
why can’t i find someone i’m smart i’ve got a cool job and my naturally bronzed complexion means i can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t
oh honey it’s not you it’s them
no it’s not she was too beautiful for me
it’s true i’m always attracted to women i can’t have i do it all the time i did the same thing with the two of you
the two of them i don’t understand
well uh there was a time when i had a thing for penny and i thought she was into me too because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me but apparently i misread those signals
that was before penny i make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time i’m very oldfashioned that way
so at uh some point you probably had a thing for me too
oh come on raj not even a little bit
not that i can think of
nope i guess the heart wants what the heart wants or in this case doesn’t i mean at all what
ye who now will bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing badabum
i think the word you’re looking for is bravo
okay you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen
melted snowmen are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water
i don’t know what’s the difference
well it’s a game of the imagination leonard paint a picture
fine you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen there are carrots and lumps of coal in the water
what happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes
oh it’s like i’m really there
i gotta tell you this this is the most holiday fun i’ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and i stopped caring about the blood in my stool
what are you drinking there a little eggnog
yes what is there a problem
no it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage pretty christmassy
since when is eggnog a christmas drink eggs are available all year ’round i’ve been known to enjoy this poolside
come on sheldon you know all the christmas stories and the carols you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there just admit it you’re getting a little yuletide spirit
oh don’t be silly christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry why is this so important to you
honestly because i had enough crappy christmases as a kid and i’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now
what was so bad about them
i grew up in a house full of crazy academics instead of leaving santa milk and cookies we had to leave him a research paper and in the morning you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded
no wonder you love christmas that sounds amazing
it wasn’t amazing i got a cminus four years in a row
yeah i’m familiar with your work cminus was your gift
amy i’m really sorry i didn’t mean to upset you
it’s fine i’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice i didn’t have my first kiss till i was 22 and the guy only did it so i’d give him back his insulin
sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants
forget it i don’t expect you guys to understand
i understand in seventh grade i played spin the bottle and it landed on alina shankar she said if i came near her she would break the bottle and cut me
you think that’s bad in college i passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on
sometimes i get so lonely i sit on my left hand until it goes numb then i put it in my right hand and pretend i’m holding hands with another person
i do that too sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel and i let it
it’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone
but you’re not alone anymore now you’ve got sheldon
i do and don’t worry someday you’ll have somebody too
thank you i hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are
thank you rajesh he wants me i’m good we can go now
now that i know she doesn’t like me i’m kind of into her
all right i think i cracked the code to lower the drawbridge
great let’s do it they pick up bells and play according to the numbers the tune is jingle bells
you did it the drawbridge is down you cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room and in the corner chained to the wall you see a bloodied and beaten santa claus he says ho ho help me
yes we found santa christmas is saved don’t ever tell my mother i said that
i take out my skeleton key and run to santa to unchain him
but first i cast a spell of paralysis on stuart and howard
you can’t talk you’re paralyzed i get right up in santa’s big fat face and say well well well jolly old saint nick we meet again yeah i believe the last time we spoke was in the baybrook mall in galveston texas when i was five years old isn’t that right
my mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what i wanted for christmas and i told you my poppop because that was the year my grandfather died i missed him and i wanted him back
poppop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science but you didn’t bring him back did you no instead i got lincoln logs well you can build a lot of neat things out of lincoln logs but poppop ain’t one of ’em and now you’re here asking me for something to save you well sorry mr kringle but today’s not your day i’m leaving you here to rot and i hope the ogres feast on your bones i take the skeleton key and i toss it into the chasm and on the way out i give santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly
okay so wolowitz and stuart are paralyzed santa’s dead and i picked this over having sex with my girlfriend
oh hello sheldon you should be asleep
well then you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots
oh i’ve been wanting to talk to you i’m sorry i disappointed you when you were a little boy i can do a lot of magical things but unfortunately bringing your poppop back isn’t one of them
but i do have something special for you close your eyes
oh i hope it’s a train
oh it’s better than a train
okay open ’em it’s a cannon pointed at sheldon this is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres
wait uh uh hang on in my defense…
ho ho ho ya big dork fires cannon
well i must say leonard when i first heard your idea for giant jenga i was sceptical
i can’t blame you tiny twister was a complete bust
no i was wrong the looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice i’ve never felt so alive answers door oh hello alex uh let me go get you last night’s recordings
well you remember when you told me i talk in my sleep well it occurred to me that like most things i say it’s probably pure gold so i started recording it all and now alex gets to comb through eight hours of what i like to call sheldon after dark
hey just playing a little giant jenga here
oh i know i’m the one who had to buy him the helmet so do you have any plans this weekend
well most of saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done how about you
oh i’m gonna go see kip thorne give a lecture on subatomic spacetime
ooh that’s his take on john wheeler’s quantum foam that should be great
well if you want you can come with me
ah i’d love to but i’m supposed to hang out with penny
well she’s not really into that kind of stuff
yeah okay well if you want to hear about the lecture i can tell you all about it at work or you know over dinner sometime
oh come on that can’t be true
i did the research tony the tiger dig’em the frog cap’n crunch toucan sam count chocula trix the rabbit snap crackle and pop not one cereal mascot is a girl it’s a total breakfast sausage fest
almost franken berry boo berry sugar bear and the honey nut cheerio bee i believe his name is buzz
terrific something weird happened and i don’t know what to do about it
sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night
how could you do that to me you know i’ve been working it with alex for weeks
working it you can’t even talk to her
you look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper
she knows i have a girlfriend it’s so weird
oh my god you’re loving this
to my bones i mean i’m not gonna do anything about it i love penny it’s just nice to have a young attractive woman sniffing around the goods
i both hate you and want to be you this is ryan gosling all over again
ah gentlemen what is on the conversational menu this morning
leonard stole my woman and he knew full well i was only six to eight months away from making my move
your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it
well that’s not acceptable i mean i’m her boss she needs to be solely focused on my needs not distracted by your pasty androgynous brand of sexuality
oh please look at you with your pouty beestung lips
what do you guys think i should do
i say you tell alex your heart belongs to penny i provide her a shoulder to cry on and then roughly half a year later i give it to her good
i want to thank you all for coming on such short notice uh in the past i’ve reached out to each of you individually but i believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group which as you can see from your commemorative tshirts i have dubbed sheldon cooper’s council of ladies
i need your advice about a delicate workplace situation uh to protect those involved i’ll be changing their names
well a short bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate let’s call this colleague ricardo shillyshally
no no shillyshally has red hair and uh he briefly served in the mexican navy anyway despite the fact that he has a girlfriend shillyshally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady
it’s your assistant alex isn’t it
no no no this is tondelaya della ventimiglia
wait what the hell’s going on with leonard and alex
no uh no i’m sorry who’s talking about leonard and alex
okay look it’s not really about ricardo and tondelaya it is really about her boss who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice which is surprising because dr einstein von brainstorm he’s usually pretty smart about these things
i’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about leonard would never cheat on you
she’s right but say the word i got a lab full of cocaineaddicted monkeys with nothing to lose one of them could end up in the backseat of her car or her shower
ladies ladies please we’re not here to talk about penny okay we’re here to talk about me uh i mean einstein von brainstorm oh darn it all right i guess the cat’s out of the bag let me explain what’s going on ricardo is really leonard
we know what’s going on sheldon
well alex is your employee if she’s doing something that’s making leonard uncomfortable you should talk to her
oh no he’s not uncomfortable at all no he’s loving it yeah he’s strutting around like he’s fivefootsix
sheldon you need to talk to alex right away
talk to her that’s all you’ve got with a cool name like sheldon cooper’s council of ladies i really expected more give me back the tshirts
alex check my schedule what does my afternoon look like
i think it’s pretty wide open oh wait here’s something at four o’clock give alex a talking to
well that snuck up on us didn’t it
let’s not call it a problem let’s call it an opportunity to solve a serious problem
you don’t know oh you poor dear your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up you made an inappropriate sexual advance towards dr hofstadter
what i didn’t make a sexual advance on anybody
now there’s no need to get defensive i’m not unsympathetic to your plight my father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm texas day
full of eggs and only appealing for a short time
this conversation is making me uncomfortable
yeah you and me both sister now please understand i don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because see from an evolutionary standpoint you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce but during the work day when you feel possessed by amorous intent may i suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases let’s see here oh yes check out this oozy doozy
so does this fellow but he can’t without it burning like hot soup
i don’t know just having a good day this morning sheldon fell asleep on the way to work so i got to listen to the radio that was pretty crazy
mm i found this quiz online called which star trek character are you and it only took me four tries to get captain kirk
hmm well i’m glad you’re having such a great day
yeah and the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl
oh i just didn’t know if you meant me or alex
um why would i mean alex
because i know she hit on you and i know you liked it
don’t play dumb with me ricardo shillyshally
i’m missing something enters apartment to sheldon did you say something to penny about alex
oh yes yeah and a fat lot of good it did me all she did was get mad at you
i needed advice about a woman i would have asked you but if the last few years have proven anything it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle
at least i know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend
good to know yeah a few more helpful hints like that you may find yourself on the council of ladies answering phone hello i see uh what time very well then huh that was the human resources department at the university apparently my assistant alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace
oh my god what did you do
hmm let me think nothing i’m a delight
knock knock knock human resources department knock knock knock human resources department knock knock knock human resources department
ah dr cooper have a seat
i called you in today because your assistant alex jensen has lodged a complaint against you
so i’ve been told but i can’t understand what she has to complain about i mean she has a frontrow seat as i make scientific history there’s string cheese in my minifridge and that’s for anyone yeah and just yesterday i led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of diseaseridden genitalia
cancel my next appointment this is gonna take a while dr cooper you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace
well according to ms jensen you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich i don’t even know what that means but i’m gonna go ahead and tell you you can’t say it
oh i see the confusion here no no alex thought i was singling her out no i meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges you know even you you’re a slave
well yyou ii’m just saying you know at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…
whuhah woah you can’t talk about that either dr cooper your language is entirely inappropriate and i’m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now
i don’t see why i’m the one being persecuted here dr hofstadter he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen you know and howard wolowitz he spent two years using university resources building a sixbreasted sex robot oh and at the office christmas party i heard rajesh koothrappali refer to you several times as brown sugar
hofstadter… wolowitz… and the last one was rajesh koothrappali
yes no yeah but in his defense that wasn’t racist he’s also brown
i’m sorry alex hit on me hit on me hit on me i’m sorry alex hit on me i’d no idea i’m cute
please forgive me i should have told you about alex
i don’t care about alex fine i care okay i hate that bitch but what really hurt is that you liked it so much i mean do i need to be worried
because she is pretty and smart and when you talk about work she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said
hang on are you feeling insecure because that’s my thing and if you take it away i don’t know what i’m bringing to this relationship
yes leonard i am insecure happy
i’m sorry i just never think of you having feelings like that
why nothing is ever going to happen between me and alex
come here tell you a secret
with all these women chasing me i kind of do feel like captain kirk
can i tell you a secret
keep talking about captain kirk and we’re all gonna stop
message received ah excuse me answering phone hello this is dr hofstadter okay all right thank you that’s weird i’m getting called in to human resources
huh i just got called in to human resources
huh that is so strange human resources wants to talk to me tomorrow to his dog could you stop licking your ass for two minutes i have a problem here
do you really think you should be drinking right now
how else am i supposed to talk to the human resources lady
i don’t know seek professional help
i did the guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee
wait you got called in too what is going on
sheldon threw us all under the bus
i feel like i’ve been called down to the principal’s office although i wouldn’t mind if brown sugar suspended me from a sex swing this may have been a mistake
relax everything’s gonna be fine before i met bernadette i was in here every other day uh little tip turn off your i like big butts ringtone before you go in
well this is all your fault
if you weren’t screwing around with sheldon’s assistant none of this would be happening
i wasn’t screwing around with anyone
oh of course not she was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles
ah mr wolowitz it’s been a while
hey janine how are tom and the kids
fine you must be dr hofstadter
yes but i think this is all a big misunderstanding
yeah yeah me too i didn’t do anything
is that alcohol on your breath
that is not true all i did was build a robot
i’m sorry i’m a feminist i don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has
actually i came to speak to mrs davis
and i’m a little busy right now
but i came to file a complaint somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature
you you dirty birdie ii thought about the things you said to me yesterday and i realized i’m deeply offended now be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms
that’s it all of you in my office now
and thanks to you i know better than to ask if you’re menstruating and based on your behaviour i don’t have to
it has been pointed out to me that some of the things i said to you could be construed as offensive and i would like to offer you my sincerest apology
yeah additionally you should know that the university has mandated that i take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future
yeah now unfortunately uh my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this so um i’m gonna need you to take it for me oh and uh you’d better ace it they’re pretty mad
so hey i was thinking about that stuff with alex
oh would you stop worrying about that
i can’t help it but look i figured i could sit around and feel insecure or i could do something about it so i got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes
no it isn’t they are extremely boring i mean how do you not kill yourself like every day anyway i decided i don’t need to be a scientist i could just look like one so i bought these
glasses i really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh my god you look so smart and hot
i know right watch this molecules
to my bedroom so i can take everything off but those glasses and maybe the boots
hey will you steam my uniform next
interesting do you recall this conversation leonard want to go halfsies on a steamer no sheldon we don’t need a steamer looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost
hi here are the makeup sponges you asked for
oh thanks i thought i had more
damn you’ve got more makeup than i do you’ve got better makeup than i do yeah i’m borrowing this
hey hey hey hey this is my comiccon makeup i love you but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend
that’s a wise policy i once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest got a terrible case of pinkeye but luckily i was going as a zombie i won second place
i feel like you guys just went to comiccon
that was san diego comiccon this is bakersfield comiccon
well it’s a lot smaller it’s more about the comic books the way these conventions used to be before they went all hollywood
so to answer your question no it’s not better
well then why are you going
it’s a comic book convention you know it’s like pizza or particle accelerators even the stinky one’s still pretty good
all right well you guys have fun i guess i’ll see you sunday night
oh hang on a second hands her the day’s newspaper hold this photographs the two of them together
to show people when they don’t believe me
oh this is the best you have booze with breakfast on a tuesday you got a problem you do it on the weekend you got brunch
sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch he can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich
oh it’s leonard he says they’re on the road and headed for bakersfield at warp speed maybe it’s the mimosa but i’m gonna give the kid an lol
it’s cute how excited they are you should have seen howard sewing his costume all week for the convention
when did howard learn to sew
when he was a little boy every couple months he would have to let his mom’s pants out
i don’t even understand why they go to these conventions
i know the four of them work at a major university they’re all super smart how can they still be into something made for 12yearolds
i don’t mind it i think howie’s just in touch with his inner child although when he comes to bed in his batman pyjamas sometimes it feels like i’m touching his inner child
it’s probably because they were bullied growing up in a world where you can’t fight back superheroes provide meaningful wishfulfillment
mmmm now i feel bad for picking on all those kids although in my defence if danny biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie
i’ve never even read a comic book you guys
i mean it’s such an important part of their lives maybe we should try reading some
the comic book store isn’t far from here
that is an amazing idea okay how many of these have i had
i think you should turn on the gps
but the turnbyturn voice option isn’t on i know i’d feel more safe if you turn on the turnbyturn voice option i love the turnbyturn voice option
has it really only been ten miles
i’m turning it on but just to shut you up
leonard bear left and continue on interstate 210
ooh sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about i’d put on my listening ears if i were you
i found a hack online i was able to upload mp3 recordings of my voice to your gps
continue on interstate 210 for five miles here’s an interesting fact about interstates
interstates are numbered as follows evennumbered routes run east and west oddnumbered routes run north and south threedigit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs
look leonard there’s a bridge drive off it
you know we’re not that far from vazquez rocks
oh they shot a lot of star trek episodes out there
we’ve got our costumes in the trunk we could go there and have a little photo shoot
great idea i haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks these cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before i eat a pretzel and they’re gone
oh smashing now leonard do you know how to get there
yeah well luckily someone in the car does
recalculating while we’re waiting do you know which president signed the intestate highway system act into law the answer coming up in 14 miles
none of you will get it it’s eisenhower
who cares just soak it in hello boys
oh hey could you please stop staring they’re just girls it’s nothing you haven’t seen in movies or in drawings
we were looking for a recommendation about comic books
oh well i recommend you don’t open a store and sell them
no we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much so we thought we’d give it a try
oh okay what do you think you might be into superhero fantasy graphic novels manga… i swear i will turn a hose on you
what kind of comics do the guys like
um a little bit of everything mostly superhero stuff
all right well who’s the best superhero
shh you can’t ask a question like that in here are you trying to start a rumble
well then what do you recommend
well uh let’s see you’ve got your basic cleancut good guys superman spiderman captain america then you have your darker antiheroes your batman your wolverine punisher
ooh i do love a bad boy
as evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters
if i were you i’d go for fables number one the artwork is sophisticated it’s intelligently written and it doesn’t objectify or stereotype women
and we’re blending and we’re blending and we’re done
i know mr data isn’t supposed to smile but here it comes
come on guys let’s do this
yeah i’m sweating my bald cap off
so what’s our first pose going to be
i say we begin with a classic star trek fight scene
sheldon how is that a fight pose
mr data’s weapon is his mind i’m wielding it
phasers on the borg charlie’s angels
now let’s do some sexy glamour shots i’ll set the mood rhythmically oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz yeah nice one oontz oontz that’s right oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz…
oh my god leonard someone’s stealing your car
what hey hey come back here
i’ll call 911 what oh no my phone is in my other pants
mine too anybody got any ideas
nope the only thing left to do now is assign blame to raj nice going
what kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight
what kind of person leaves his keys in the car
i thought we agreed this was all koothrappali’s fault
what is wrong with people why don’t they stop
maybe we’re better off what if we were to get in a car with a crazy person
look at us sheldon we’re the crazy people
well perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence
good idea why don’t you get started on that
come on let’s just start walking there’s got to be a gas station or something nearby
what you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform you’re in charge
hmm okay i’m done how did you guys finish so fast
i don’t know there were a lot of pictures and one page only had the word brakkadoom
yeah well i have street smarts
well there was a lot of action
and the story moved along at a brisk pace it was overall what’s the word i’m looking for
i don’t know how leonard can get so caught up in this
it’s crazy they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist
i know a hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up
i don’t think it’s heavy it’s some sort of magic so only thor can lift it
that makes even less sense i mean…
no no no it doesn’t thor is a god the hammer is his only he can use it it’s like sheldon and his toothbrush or his thin beckoning lips
okay hang on what if thor’s hand is on the hammer i mean if he’s touching it with his god magic does that mean i could lift it
wait i thought we were reading
we are we’re just uh giving you a head start
i wish my mom was here we could all hang out in her shadow
wool pants in the desert i feel like i’ve got poached testicles
oh you poor thing you’re sweating that’s so much worse than having your car stolen
insurance is gonna buy you a new car it’s not gonna defunk my junk
gentlemen a little less bellyaching we’re starfleet officers and a member of the borg collective
please sheldon i am so not in the mood
leonard all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love and look at us at this moment we are in fact a star trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment relying only on our wits our fortitude and our moxie as long as we have those things nothing can stop…
it says right here on the hammer whoever holds this hammer if he be worthy shall possess the power of thor
hold on who decides who’s worthy does the hammer decide
no it can’t decide it’s a hammer
you said it’s a magic hammer
yeah but it can’t make decisions
if harry potter’s wand can make decisions why can’t thor’s hammer
okay if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers i can’t even take you seriously
hello hello uh uh uh four glasses of water please anything for you guys
can i use your phone our car got stolen
why don’t you ask scotty to beam you up
scotty was on the original series and we’re next generation so joke’s on you
you can’t pick something up in outer space in space there is no up
oh yeah then how does the sun come up every day
hard to argue with those kind of street smarts
leonard and sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall why don’t we go look at those
oh great yes and then you will see i am not wrong because if we were in outer space then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment yeah that’s right the slow reader used science suck on that
was there anything valuable in the car
and about three hundred dollars worth of makeup so this thief could look like anyone right now
uh we’re going to the comiccon in bakersfield they have a big costume contest it’s cooler than it sounds
i don’t know sounds pretty cool
it it is it’s not just comic books they’ve got action figures toys a tronthemed dance party
okay he gets how cool it is
i think i have all i need here you guys need me to call someone i’m guessing your moms
thanks but we’ve got it covered
okay i just talked to my mom she arranged for us to get a rental car
great we can still make it to comiccon
are you kidding me after all we’ve been through i just want to go home
don’t be like that come on howard talk to him
fine then i guess it’s two against two how do we decide
what what about the mission you said we were a reallife landing party
yeah well we’re not we’re an imaginary landing party who had reallife garbage thrown at us by reallife strangers who think we’re idiots and to tell you the truth i’m starting to feel like one i want to go home now
okay did we at least rent the car from enterprise get it enterprise screw you that’s funny
well what if the hulk picked up thor while thor is holding the hammer
then by the transitive property of picking things up hulk picked up the hammer
no hulk picked up thor thor picked up the hammer
okay hang on if i go to a bar and pick up a guy and he picks up a girl and then we all leave together did i pick up the girl
hey are we talking about me or are we talking about thor
well i say that’s the last time we ever go outside
look right here red hulk is picking up thor’s hammer ’cause thor’s touching it
no it’s because they’re in space he’s really just touching the strap
the strap is part of the hammer
are they actually arguing about comic books
maybe thor’s hammer is a new colour of nail polish
then red hulk must be worthy
how could red hulk be worthy
there’s only one logical explanation somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature
if it’s an alternate dimension sounds like a job for a landing party
fine but set them to stun if we vaporize penny i’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again
fun fact president eisenhower signed the federal aid highway act from his hospital room
say can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system
i’ll eat later right now i’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics
it’s hot when sheldon talks dirty
so i found this web site where you send them pictures they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you how awesome is that
yeah you can pick your wardrobe you can even choose your accessories
leonard you can get a little asthma inhaler
oh this is neat think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years it would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us don’t you think
yeah if that’s your idea of what’s cool you should get one
what do you think sheldon want an action figure that looks just like you
would it come with kungfu grip
you get that these are personalised action figures
honey if you want one just get one
a hush falls over the crowd as cooper studies the board he makes his move he’s dividing both sides by i he’s adding back the coefficient he has a value for p he’s plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation the crowd goes wild nobel nobel
nobel kripke don’t look at my board
that’s a drawing of a really cool train don’t look at that either what do you want
i have some bad news you’re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow i’m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow the university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal
so they asked you to pack up your things and ship out that’s hard cheese barry you’re one of the good ones
no they’re making us work together
that’s ridiculous i am one of the great minds of our generation i work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it i said stop looking at my cool train
hmm kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and bernadette
well i wanted everybody to know i love my wife and nobody to know i forgot to turn off the laser
they’re here our action figures have arrived this is the best five hundred dollars i’ve ever spent
a thousand dollars on action figures how can you afford that
easy his family’s loaded and bernadette has a great job my wife came with both fun bags and money bags
say hello to an exact scale model of me oh i’m not dark chocolate i’m meltinyourmouth caramel
oh man look at my nose
yeah maybe wesley snipes and toucan sam just got action figures that look like you guys
i can’t believe i wasted all that money
aw and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one look at my face do i look smug i feel smug
i hate it when you make me sit through all the credits
well sometimes there’s a secret ending like in the avengers
yeah but i don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the holocaust
they could show bloopers oh no
that is sheldon’s “i’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music come on let’s just go to your place
well wait if he’s unhappyshouldn’t we talk to him
shouldn’t we talk to him have you learned nothing in six years
there is ominous music playing and there is an afghan over my head i don’t know where you’re from but where i’m from that means i’m not doing okay
want me to make you some tea
tea is for when i’m upset i’m not upset the university’s forcing me to work with kripke i’m outraged
yes cocoa do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying
see i did all this great work and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it i am angrier than ever and filled with despair
what beverage do you make for that
oh no no no i know this uh hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks
yes hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks
what the fwig cooper we were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago
and yet now you’re in my office point cooper welcome to the thunderdome kripke
we agweed to exchange copies of our work let me see yours
why don’t you show me yours first
you think i just few off the turnip twuck we exchange at the same time
how do i know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own
how do i know you’re not going to do that with mine
because i’m not interested in getting published in mad magazine zingers fly fast in the thunderdome barry
are we going to do this or not thank you so we wead each other’s work meet again tomowow
nice twy this is bwank paper
and i am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here
if this one’s bwank too i’m going to be fuwious
get that waste of money out of my face
it’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them as doll he’s right dawg
you know there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us
two words 3d printer wait maybe it’s three words no hang on okay one word a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen 3d printer
i have always wanted a 3d printer
of course you have they’re an engineer’s dream anything you can design a 3d printer can make out of plastic
oh come on you deserve one you’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money
well the prices have been coming down
oh true they’re practically giving them away you know in exchange for money
and we can make stuff we need for work with it prototypes of my cadcam designs specialized tools…
not to mention malibu koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house
we don’t need malibu koothrappali’s dream house
really smart guy where’s he supposed to park his sweet little corvette
the monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe i’m supposed to remove his brain to examine but it’s hard because now he reminds me of my uncle you’ve been awfully quiet tonight is everything okay
all right well how was work today did you exchange your research with kripke
i read his research and it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as i had thought it’s his mommy
sheldon i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better may i offer you a consoling hug
what do we have to lose
i feel like i’m being strangled by a boa constrictor why’d you stop
come on sheldon we’re going to be late
i can’t go in today i’m sick
you’re not sick you just don’t want to face kripke
what did you do put this in your tea
oh dear now i’m not even smarter than you
sheldon kripke’s not smarter than you you just got stuck on a wrong path happened to einstein he got stuck on the unified field theory for decades
oh don’t play the einstein card his great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything so everything was a great breakthrough
sheldon lee cooper i do not have time for this nonsense now go put your clothes on get in the car and lets go to work
all right geez what a grouch
how did i do that i got to remember how i did that
do you realize by owning a 3d printer we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in china
i think this thing was made in china
ooh i i think it’s done oh it worked we printed a whistle
amazing you realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store
and we made it in only three hours sounds just like storebought
okay give me a superhero pose and i will scan you into the computer for your action figure
oh i wish i was in better shape
stop holding your stomach in i’ll give you a sixpack with the computer
oh okay great now i can look like val kilmer as batman instead of val kilmer as he looks today
all right you can suck it in a little bit
cooper we have a pwobwem your work is weawy not at a wevew i expected it to be
i know go ahead mock me just use small words so i understand
don’t pway dumb with me we both know what your pwobwem is
so my work would suffew too if i was getting waid all the time
yes that is the reason my work is suffering because of all the laid i’m getting
what can i say you know she enjoys my genitals i am giving them to her on a nightly basis
okay stop bwagging you had some bwiwiant insights in here but if we’re gonna make this work you need to buckew down and focus
i’ll do what i can but it’s not going to be easy because when i’m with amy and our bathing suit areas mush together boy howdy is it magic
oh good you’re home got a little surprise for you
say hello to my little friend
oh my god that’s so cute i didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you
i know right and thanks to photographs and a little 3d modeling here comes the bride
didn’t cost a thing i made them myself
koothrappali and i bought a used 3d printer for 5000
5000 for a couple of dolls are you out of your mind
not just for a couple of dolls for as many dolls as we want and whistles
at any point did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money
it’s kind of dawning on me now
i don’t believe you howie we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this
what are you talking about we make plenty of money
i make plenty of money you make peanuts
yes but we’re married now that means when you get sick i take care of you and when you make a bunch of money i get to buy stuff sorry if you don’t like it but that’s how love works
no here’s how love works you’re gonna return the machine or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those oh my god are you actually thinking about it
all right i don’t understand why didn’t you just tell kripke the truth
because the truth made me look bad whereas a ridiculous baldfaced lie makes me look good anyway if kripke asks tell him my coitus with amy is frequent intense and whimsically inventive
that is what i write on the bathroom walls for a whimsically inventive time call leonard hofstadter
i know you’re joking but i’d be okay with that
yeah sheldon can i ask you a question
you ever going to sleep with amy
we don’t ask sheldon things like that
maybe you don’t i do what’s the deal
well word around the university is i’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling
all right come on be serious look you guys have been going out a long time she would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you so what are you doing
all right we’re down the rabbit hole what are you doing
well first of all i’m quite fond of amy
penny all my life i have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others handshaking hugging prostate exams but i’m working on it you know just recently i had to put vaporub on amy’s chest a year ago that would have been unthinkable
now you know how i feel when i have to put it on you
okay hang on are you saying someday you and amy might actually get physical
oh my god out loud sheldon i know this wasn’t easy for you and i’m really glad we could have this conversation
are you sure you want to do this give up your half of the 3d printer
yes and can you please make that out to bernadette i was taken off the joint account until i learn the value of money
nah i blew my food allowance on pokemon cards
well the equation balances but it’s certainly not elegant
whatever you get any wast night
gave it to her good huh
no i gave it to her well now over here i was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…
yeah yeah yeah was she naked or was she weawing wingewie
i was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body
can we get back to work
sure sure sure you guys ever use any toys
toys i do have a model rocket next to my bed
a wocket you’we a fweak i wove it
i don’t know why i avoided the harry potter books for so long these are great i just started number six
that’s a good one dumbledore dies in that one yeah i know i didn’t see it coming either
you brought up the subject i contributed an interesting fact on that subject it’s called the art of conversation okay your turn
what is wrong with you if i did that you’d bitch about it for weeks
oh really leonard are you going to have another one of your hissy fits
hissy fits i have hissy fits
yes and i have a theory why because of your lactose intolerance you switched over to soy milk soy contains estrogenmimicking compounds i think your morning cocoa puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman
you are unbelievable i don’t know why i put up with you you’re controlling you’re irritating
there you go again nag nag nag you’re only proving my point little lady
you know what screw you sheldon you are the most annoying person i have ever met
what i’m annoying you criticize my behaviour all the time sheldon don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast sheldon when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral don’t yawn and point at your watch sheldon don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly you’re impossible
that’s it i don’t i don’t have to put up with this
actually i have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do
aw here’s what i think of your roommate agreement
you pick that up right now
roommate agreement section 27 paragraph 5 the roommate agreement like the american flag cannot touch the ground
i don’t care i don’t have to do anything you say because i don’t think i want to live here anymore

dobby the elf dies in book seven
what you don’t say thank you
it’s my suitcase i lent it to you two years ago
well then i should tell you i broke the wheel and the handle so is everyone from bernadette’s company going to vegas
no just me her and a couple of the big wigs it’s part of a bonus she got
cool did she discover a cure for something
not exactly they spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage
is there a good anal leakage
anyway it was bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation
way to make lemonade you know from around the corner where fudge is made
hey i got a favour to ask
my mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her
dumped her what did he use a forklift sorry there’s nothing funny about morbid obesity
she’s huge it was funny anyway i was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay
dude i’m a single man saturday night is my party night
really what do you got going on
i don’t know maybe drive down to hollywood hit a few hot spots see if i can get lucky
yeah tell me if this sounds familiar you pay fifteen dollars to park you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in you push your way to the bar where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together your children grandchildren meanwhile she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote beverly hills chihuahua then you give up on anyone ever loving you go to marie callender’s buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot
what time should i be at your mother’s
i swear that man is the most egotistical insufferable human being i have ever met
yeah but you two make such a cute couple like burt and ernie you guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers
well i’ve had it i am done i can’t i can’t live with him for one more minute
wow where are you going to go
i was thinking here with you
no not at all no it’s it’s great it’s terrific i you know i just can’t help feel bad about sheldon i mean how’s he going to get by without you ernie
yeah he does but it’s not the same
um well um all right you you know how in harry potter and the halfblood prince ron didn’t abandon harry just because harry started dating ron’s sister
sorry spoiler alert my point is as much as i want to live with you i can’t do it knowing how much sheldon needs you
please the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy his his stooge his doormat
well you know what they say if it ain’t broke
wow it sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together
no no no i do i do it’s just i mean it’s a really big step
is it we’re together all the time financially it makes great sense can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this
well um i’m just a little thirsty
great i’ll go get my stuff
yeah okay all right don’t freak out you can make this work
oh could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom i take a lot of medicine
oh please let some of it be xanax
no thank you mrs wolowitz as it is i’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like i’m a fireman rescuing an infant
oh please you’re a tall glass of brown water have dessert
well i i really couldn’t but uh i’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst
the doctor said they were like russian nesting dolls well if you have to go how about i put a little doggie bag together for you
that would be lovely thank you sound of crying mrs wolowitz uh are you okay
don’t mind me i just cry when i’m lonely and have nothing to live for
i uh i suppose i could stay for some dessert
great you like chocolate chip cheesecake
one vintage mr mxyzptlk action figure that’s leonard’s
one game of thrones collector’s edition longclaw sword oh leonard and i bought that together that’s a bit of an ethical conundrum eh i’ll keep it
so uh what’s your plan moving forward
uh suppose i’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate what a task that will be do you know how uncivilized leonard was when i took him in
oh it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule he would just go whenever the mood struck him
what if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways
that would be ideal if a person like that existed i would sign on no further questions asked
me aren’t i your perfect roommate
think about it sheldon i’m not a stranger we’re intellectually compatible i’m willing to chauffeur you around town and your personality quirks which others find abhorrent or rageinducing i find cute as a button what do you think
tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea
see you can’t i’m gonna go see if leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed
knock knock knock good buddy leonard knock knock knock good buddy leonard knock knock knock good buddy leonard
hey good buddy so uh i was just talking to amy and she made me realize that this little dustup between you and me is much ado about nothing
yes all is forgiven so come back home i’ll make you some soy hot chocolate and then i’ll you tell you about our exciting new devilmaycare bathroom policy
okay amy’s decided she wants to move in with me so i need you to come back home you lovable scamp that’s a lot of product
oh get this suddenly sheldon wants me back because amy wants to move in with him
well too late pal i’m not going anywhere penny and i are very happy living together isn’t that right
it’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment
leonard please you know amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for
yes that is a real thing and it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with and that’s fine
well if he doesn’t want to live with her then he should tell her how he feels
well maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings
feelings what am i a hippie at a lovein no the problem is she laid out a series of logical arguments that i couldn’t refute
that is the worst isn’t it
i’m sorry sheldon i can’t help you oh spoiler alert this door’s about to slam in your face
oh there you are when do i get a key to our apartment
hey how’d it go last night with my mom
yeah uh after dinner we watched a rerun of rockford files and then she opened a bottle of uh cream sherry and the next thing i know she was tucking me into your bed
mmhmm how do you sleep in these things silk pajamas on satin sheets i slid out of the bed like three times
rajesh you up you ready for breakfast
okay raj listen to me you need to get out of there
but i have a cream sherry hangover and i smell blintzes
if you don’t leave now she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life
trust me you’re not jewish that’s how they get you
you’re being silly i can leave whenever i want
oh really where are your clothes and your shoes
they’re on the chair right over… oy vey
you gave leonard somewhere to go thanks to you amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels like i’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it
okay listen the truth is i don’t want him living with me
great kick him out break his heart everybody wins
no i don’t want to break his heart i love him this is just happening too fast
you think this is fast it’s just a matter of time before i see amy’s leg stubble in my shower
yeah and i’ve seen those legs you might want to get some drano
hold on if you don’t want to live with leonard why don’t you just tell him
well you know how he is he’s sensitive and emotional
that’s because he drinks too much soy milk
well i don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth
i suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying angry accusations and the highpitched wails of despair
yeah and who knows how amy will react
what were we thinking we should have just done it the regular way
those chinese acrobats in cirque du soleil made it look so easy
honestly if i could bend that far what would i need with you
if you could bend that far you’d be doing us both a favour phone
you were right i can’t get out of here
i’m trapped my clothes have been in the laundry all day and she hid my keys i think they might be in her bra because she jingles when she walks what do i do
hey you wanted a woman in your life now you got one
rajesh tatellah i ran you a bath
oh my god she’s not gonna bathe me is she
gee i wish i could tell you no all right well thanks again for helping me out
should we go back and rescue him
it’s too late we’ll see him at his bar mitzvah
here you go i picked up the chinese food just the way leonard used to
spicy mustard from the korean deli
yes amy are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship
oh and uh check this out i took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us
‘cause we out dropping science son
what why is it the message i only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in
well what is it then i did everything just the way you like it
then what the hell sheldon we have been going out for over two years and i have been nothing but patient with you i watch your dopey space movies i signed your ridiculous contract i even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery i am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have you give me one good reason why i can’t live here
she doesn’t want to live with leonard so he has to come live here again she’s the snake in our garden she’s the reason we can’t be happy
yeah hey ames nothing i was all set to move in with sheldon and now i hear i can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with leonard
i said the truth you don’t want to live with leonard and you know it
since when don’t you want to live with me
oh don’t get all huffy you’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if i was ready
yeah i think we should talk about that
and since you love the truth so much why don’t you tell amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me
i thought we were talking about the other thing
well the evidence does support that
come on amy let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are
you know what would show them i should move in here with you
do you want to catch up on some walking dead
have you seen the one where lori dies
or maybe she doesn’t let’s find out
you’ll never believe what happened to me at work today
this old guy was choking on his food and i saved his life
you’re kidding did you heimlich him
no i said oh my god i think that old guy’s choking and then one of the busboys heimlich’ed him
yeah that was the point of the story
oh yeah speaking of work do you know if you have thursday night off
what do you mean why it’s valentine’s day
oh right yeah we can do something
you could be a little more into it
no i’m into it i’m into it just there’s so much pressure to make the night special and it never works out
okay well this time it’s going to be different because i am like a romance ninja you don’t see it coming and then bam romance watch out hearts kisses love oohya
you know sometimes i think i’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be and then you go and do that
so in conclusion i believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste
i concur but you changed the subject what are we doing for valentine’s day
oh you caught that did you
okay okay okay okay okay okay
bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working like 17 hours a day and i’ve got a lot on my plate too because i’ve been busting my tail playing assassin’s creed
hey stuart you got anything going on for valentine’s day
not really other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and whiteknuckling it till morning what do you got going on
oh well i was going to spend the night with my special little lady but uh she got worms and then i had to take her to the vet
there must be something we can do
well uh how about you keep the store open late and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates
yeah the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself
that’s good or maybe something a little less hand in the pants
ah alex excellent i have a research problem that i believe you can help with
oh dr cooper thank you i’ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work
oh no no that’s not going to happen no what i need you to do is find a valentine’s gift for my girlfriend
you realize i passed up an opportunity to work at fermilab to take this job with you
well i guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents now here is let’s see this is this is about two thousand dollars um i think she likes monkeys and the colour grey contribute to my work ah kids say the darnedest things
yeah one second come here i want to show you something
well i was trying to come up with something really romantic to give bernadette for valentine’s day since she’s been such a pain in the ass
you can’t find a card that says that
check it out i used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one onethousandth the size of a grain of sand
from her microhusband that is amazing how long did this take you
mmm about twelve hours i pulled an allnighter
yeah i know it really took a bite out of my video game time what are you and penny doing
oh i’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner
oh that’s not bad but as far as romance goes i think my gift hits it right out of… bumps into chair and drops the slide
want to come to dinner with us
okay amy will be here shortly expecting the perfect valentine’s gift so you’re up kid dazzle me go
okay i think i have some really great choices i went on amy’s facebook page and read up on her interests
now see i never would have thought to do that clearly i made a good choice farming this out to you but i am telling you amy hit the boyfriend jackpot anyway my socks are on let’s knock them off
well um i know she loves playing the harp so i found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs
now amy already has a real harp and it can play any song what are you trying to pull here
no i just thought it would be…
okay um i know she’s a fan of the canterbury tales
so i found this cool map that illustrates the character’s journey through england i thought we could put it in a really nice frame
but she’s got google maps on her phone
i don’t know how to respond to that
well i hope it’s with a third good option because these first two buh
okay well uh luckily i saved the best for last since amy’s a neuroscientist i did some research and found out that santiago ramon y cajal the father of modern neuroscience did lots of hand drawings of brain cells and i managed to find this signed print
wow oh this is truly remarkable
i think i’ll keep it for myself
it’s too late i call dibs
no problem we just sat down
mmm would you like some wine
yeah fill her up i’ll tell you when to stop
look we can still have a nice night just tell me where it is
maybe if you did what you said you were going to do i’d tell you
she hid my xbox like i’m a child yeah and my mom got me that for my birthday so if you don’t give it back i’m telling
i’ve been working late every night all i asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry but did he do it no he just kept on playing that stupid game you like pushing buttons so much try pushing them on the washing machine
sorry doesn’t clean my underpants buddy
i told you turn them inside out
and i told you to bite me
trying to have a magical night here guys
it’s just this guy i used to date
until he cheated on me with my friend gretchen who’s here with him now
and it looks like she lost a lot of weight damn it
i know it’s not ideal but don’t let them ruin our night
no you’re totally right she could be skinny ’cause she’s dying
you know what screw them our night is going to be way more special than theirs
what penny’s ex is proposing to gretchen oh you got to be kidding me
two can play this game penny…
it’s nice that all the people who are lonely on valentine’s day can come here tonight and be together
yeah i’m really looking forward to it in fact there’s no place i would rather be than here
except on a date with anybody
you know you and i have so much fun hanging out if you were a girl all our problems would be solved
oh yeah think about it we’d hang out we’d read comic books we’d see movies it’d be like the best relationship ever
then i’d take you home slip off your little black dress and just piledrive you into oblivion
oh i can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with
isn’t it kind of nice i mean he was with the wrong person and now he found the right person
what so i’m the wrong person maybe you want to be with gretchen too
yeah maybe tonight but a year from now he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his xbox well he will
you know what why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our valentine’s day
yes absolutely now they’re doing that phony linkarmdrink thingy i totally taught him that
i thought we were letting it go
we were it’s just it’s not fair okay they’re bad people it’s not supposed to end happy for them it’s supposed to end happy for me
um it did end happy for you you’re here with me
okay this is getting a little hard to not take personally
oh come on don’t make this about you
oh i’m not it’s about you
yeah well whatever okay i told you valentine’s day sucks
this one does and you’re the reason why
you know compared to them i’m feeling pretty good about us
me too how about we blow off dessert go home early i’ll do that laundry
damn it it’s in the washing machine
okay shall we go to dinner
hang on as you know i had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts
yes and as you know i planned to pretend to enjoy it i’ve been working on this facial expression all day
and i appreciate your effort but upon contemplation i decided i was being selfish so i cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate valentine’s day
by doing none of it no dinner no romance no gifts we stay here order a pizza and watch one of your beloved star war trek things
well that’s what you’d love isn’t it
well then that’s what we’re going to do
well i don’t know what to say this is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me and that’s including an amazing gift that i gave myself earlier today
i’m your girlfriend that’s my job and i know giftgiving puts a lot of pressure on you so whatever you got me you can return
no no after everything you didn’t do for me tonight i want you to have it
sheldon cooper caltech university employee information
in case of emergency please contact… amy farrah fowler and there’s my phone number this is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me
well i thought if i have a stroke or a kidney stone who would i want to share that with
it’s like you said you’re my girlfriend
yeah okay stop ruining valentine’s day and order my pizza
yep you know what that was pretty crappy of you i mean all i wanted to do was give you a great night and it’s like youyou went out of your way to destroy it
yeah i know i’m a total bitch
fine you win you’re a bitch why couldn’t we just have a nice time
i don’t know maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and i’ve been really happy
okay you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that
obviously i have some commitment issues
as long as things keep going great between us you’ll keep asking me to marry you and eventually i’m gonna end up saying yes and then we’re gonna be married forever and the whole thing just freaks me out
okay i know i propose a lot so how about this i promise i will never ask you to marry me again
what what do you mean are you breaking up with me
no no no no no but if someday you decide you want to get married you have to propose to me
yes it’s all on you but i got to tell you when the time comes i want the whole nine yards i want you down on one knee flowers i want to be swept off my feet
and i’m cool with surprises but nothing on a jumbotron i don’t want to cry on a big screen like that
okay you know what this might be the wine talking but i have a very important question to ask you
sorry maybe next year i’m just kidding romance ninja let’s have sex waugh
thank you guys for doing this
we’re glad you could make it
usually i spend valentine’s day sad and alone this year i’m just sad
what is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy
i know i hate myself most of the time but tonight’s the night i know everyone else does too
i got to tell you we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this excuse me everybody can i have your attention please we’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with but that doesn’t make us mutants the only mutants here are in these comic books we’ve got to stop defining our selfworth by whether or not we’re in a relationship you know what i see when i look around i see a room full of great people so let’s give ourselves a break we are a community and as long as we have each other we’re never truly alone
that was cool what you said
thank you uh would you like to uh get a cup a cup of coffee or…
hello another medical emergency what’s wrong with him now i seriously doubt he was bitten by a chinese bird spider how exactly does a bump feel asian just put him on the phone sheldon i am not driving over there again because i drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache yes i still want to be your emergency contact yes you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour i’m on my way brain tumour would explain a lot
so then i went to cambridge which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like hogwarts that’s where i fell in love with astronomy and now i’m an astrophysicist at caltech so i guess you could say uh raj is my name and stars are my game and rhyming is also my game so uh two games uh anyway that that’s enough about me i want to hear everything about you
i have to go to the bathroom
i go to the bathroom too sometimes more frequently than i care to admit oh i’ve had it checked out it’s nothing hmm this is going great mmm can i have a refill on my chai tea yes i have a good feeling about this girl can be seen sneaking past window and leaving i should have bought condoms
hello i’m dr sheldon cooper welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags my apologies that this episode is coming late i did shoot one last week in honour of black history month but i was informed by my roommate that my spoton portrayal of george washington carver could be considered wildly racist my heart goes out to the members of the africanamerican community who like me have been kept down by the man now fun with flags is not just for the flag aficionado it’s also for the flag novice so to help me with that please welcome my friend neighbour and flag virgin yeah not a real virgin she’s had coitus many times sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast once while he was trying to watch the incredibles penny
so penny i understand you would like to learn more about flags
yeah i can’t tell you how many times i’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and i just couldn’t join in
yeah well you came to the right place
uh i’m sorry can we just pause for a minute
i just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera you know like like a real conversation it’s something we work on in my acting class
interesting a few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like
yeah let’s try it again and maybe this time you could work on your body language a bit you know when you’re all hunched like that you’re shutting the audience out but when you’re relaxed and open you’re inviting them in
right and which one do i want
if our friend the flag has taught me anything it’s to go where the wind takes you as long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole and action so penny what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night
um well i’m from nebraska so what can you tell me about the state flag
gosh penny what’d you have for breakfast a big glass of good question juice the nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue spread your legs invite them in
i’m telling you something’s wrong i can always feel it when raj is in trouble
geez how close were you guys before we got married
don’t look under that rock knocking raj you okay
oh just because i’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened maybe something good happened
of course not nothing good ever happens opens door he is wearing a stained vest his hair is unkempt and he is drinking wine from a bottle
it smells pretty ripe in here you kind feel it in your eyes
i was humiliated by yet another woman
you didn’t kill her and chop her up that’s not what we’re smelling right
no i took her for coffee and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me
i went and looked it was a high and tiny window she must have been very motivated
i’m sorry that’s awful but come on you got to shake it off
yeah you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life
why not with online shopping and overnight delivery i can get anything i want look i just ordered a case of dinty moore beef stew and two live lobsters on amazon
oh you’re kidding let me see well i’ll be look you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf
the surf and turf sounds good see if they have corn on the cob
guys we’re trying to get him out of here not you in
you’re wasting your time just please leave me alone
we could go to red lobster and talk about it we’re all thinking it i just had the decency to wait for him to leave
hello how’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going
fine just hold on mommy’s on the phone sorry we’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day so things are a little intense makes me miss my marijuanaabusing flatworms those guys were mellow
good news uh the latest episode of fun with flags is online
oh that’s right how’d it go with penny
much better than i expected she even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language watch welcome to my world not welcome to my world welcome not welcome
i know i’m still learning to control it
did you tell penny how helpful she was
because she’s your friend and she did a nice job i’m sure she’d like to hear it
i didn’t mean now hello yeah yeah you want a cigarette well i’d like a normal boyfriend deal with it
you need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing
no i didn’t start yet it’s fine
okay so what do you need
well i was thinking about you helping me out last night knock knock knock penny and i just wanted to tell you knock knock knock penny that the answer to the question who did a great job is you knock knock knock penny
yes you were very natural in front of the camera and i found your suggestions extremely helpful
aw sweetie you just made my day
hey my acting class is putting on a play friday night i could put you and amy on the guest list
oh that sounds terrible why would i want to do that
that’s right they’re no good without the lighter
well so much for your advice on complimenting penny
she tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play don’t worry luckily i had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river
sheldon that’s very rude she helped you with your show the right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play
that better be tootsie rolls you’re throwing at me
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny oh yeah much better
amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me i’m obligated to do something nice for you so yes i’ll go to your dopey play
hey i don’t want you to go any more
you should go ’cause you want to go not because you have to
oh dear lord more rules where does it stop can i want to go because i have to want to go
yeah but now wait do whatever i want or whatever i have to want
oh for god’s sake just come to the play
all right i don’t want to but at least that makes sense
you know i haven’t seen raj in several days is he no longer a part of our social group and if so should we be interviewing for a replacement perhaps this time we go latin
he’s just decided he’s never leaving his apartment again
oh brilliant i’ve been itching to pull that trigger
he’s upset because he can’t get anywhere with women
would it help if i gave him some pointers i’m just funnin’ ya
hi i don’t know if you remember me but i was here the other night at your party
oh yeah you left with raj
you’re the one okay let me tell you something that guy you blew off happens to be my best friend okay he was devastated
sorry can you just give him this
okay but i gotta warn you raj is a proud passionate man if you go running out on him again you’re only gonna get like three or four more chances before you are history
come on she came back this is good news you should celebrate
not even a little i mean we could have a pants party go put some on
why would i want her number i don’t want anything to do with this woman
no you don’t get it i want nothing to do with any woman my heart is stone from now on i’m a monk i renounce all worldly pleasures except for lobster and garlic butter
boy i want to tell you it’s her loss but you are not making it easy
you’re you’re a good friend for trying to help but i’ve made my choice
all right well i’ll see you around
see you no wait take her number i don’t want the temptation
i must be strong so i don’t stray from my true purpose the study of the universe
all right thanks for ruining lobster for me
wait give me the number give me the number give me the number
so amy what’s going on with your addiction study
sadly i’m no longer associated with that project
typical bureaucratic nonsense you can get animals addicted to a harmful substance you can dissect their brains but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional
all right let’s get this stupid play over with
uh hang on empty your pockets
you know why the nintendo ds and the psp now the gameboy
aw for pete’s sake can we go now
well is that all of it pulls a rubik’s cube from his pants just set it down
just so you know this is not a stupid play a streetcar named desire is an american classic
it’s about streetcars oh great i won’t need this pulls out an etchasketch
just a sec oh who says just a sec i hate myself hello
uh would you like to come in
i just wanted to say i’m sorry for running out of the coffee shop that wasn’t cool so uh yeah i’m sorry
wait can you at least tell me what went wrong it’s okay i can take anything unless it’s something i did or said or am ‘cause those are like my buttons
no it’s not any of that it’s just i kind of have a hard time around people i don’t know
really then what were you doing at the comic book store that night
i’ve been trying to force myself into situations that i’m not comfortable with i saw the flyer in the store window and i made myself go in i don’t even like comic books
then what were you doing there
i lied i love them i only said that so you’d go out with me
oh you don’t want to do that i’m kind of broken
oh i totally am if it wasn’t for this beer i couldn’t even talk to you right now i’m a wreck there are many things seriously wrong with me and not quirks either like diagnosable psychological problems maybe brain damage
well how do i know you’re not just saying that
go out with me on one date and i promise you you’ll see
you won’t regret it i’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met and that boys and girls is how it’s done
you love her very much don’t you
i think you have a great capacity for devotion you’ll be lonely when she passes on won’t you i understand what that is
she is but when do they get to the part about streetcars
…when i was a very young girl when i was 16 years old i made the discovery love all at once and much much too completely it was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow that’s how it struck the world for me but i was unlucky deluded
how can she remember all those lines but as a waitress she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger
look i know you guys don’t want to do this but we have no choice so you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with
yeah well it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee and frankly this is one i believe in okay here we go encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences
come on if i was any good at convincing women to do stuff i wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower
if you ask me this whole thing is a waste of our time
helping anyone people should take care of themselves
oh like yesterday when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners the pharmacy and the post office
i’m not saying people can’t use tools even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam
you don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science
i think that’s incredibly sexist of you i believe in a genderblind society like in star trek where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals
you mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive but a black lady still answered the space phone
oh i did spend a lot of my shower time with lieutenant uhura
howard’s disturbing recollections aside i don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work
yes i know you’re too smart for this
exactly it’s like asking the human torch to heat up your frozen burrito
got it all right i’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peerreview process is for papers to be submitted under genderneutral names like s smith instead of samantha smith
i suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be prejudged harry potter’s jk rowling uh star trek’s dc fontana
van nuys poledancer dd melons all right i think we’ve really helped women today let’s fire up the old xbox
guys please don’t make this a school project where i’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch
we’re not this time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch
so you think i’m one of the smarter kids
no you’re a tool i was using to make my point
guys our topic is encouraging women in science can you at least play a less sexist game
how is it sexist my character wields a battle axe as well as any man
not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30 and have enough milk left over to open a baskin robbins
mother warriorprincess franchise owner i hear glass ceilings shattering all over town
sheldon you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science
all your ideas address the issue at a university level by then it’s too late you need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences
that’s actually good why didn’t i think of that
some people are otters some people are rocks
i wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run
maybe i could call my old middle school see if we can talk to some of the female students
that’s great try to set up something for the three of us to go over there
oh hold on while i’m comfortable speaking about science i’m not sure i know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren better google it
what exactly are you looking up
how do i get 12yearold girls excited
thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night
are you kidding you brought fancy wine and made fondue i’ve slept with guys for less it’s a joke based on real events
anyway i was hoping i could uh pick your brains a little i’m supposed to take lucy out friday and i need a killer first date
well evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger so i recommend an unsafe environment seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks picnic near a lunatic asylum a wine tasting on skid row
uh lucy has some uh social anxiety issues maybe we could start with something simpler
why don’t you take her to disneyland you go on space mountain you’re in the dark she’s holding onto you
yeah but you just have to remember that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end so make sure you got your clothes back on it’s a joke based on real events
mm disneyland i don’t know with all the crowds and the weird characters walking around just reminds me too much of india
i haven’t been to disneyland since i was a kid we should definitely go one weekend
so blow off work go on a weekday
hooky i’ve never played hooky in my life my mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music
it’s more like how girls end up at a best western hotel with a 34yearold guy named luther
i can laugh about it now
so what do you say this friday we ditch work and go to disneyland
excuse me i thought we were trying to solve my problem
oh yeah right wait what was your problem again
i am a man who can’t talk to women trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people
hmm we doing just disney or california adventure too
it’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students
well they’re actually pretty excited i’m their most famous alum if you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes
this must feel pretty good for you coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut
yeah last time i was here i was just a scrawny little nerd
and now you’re also an astronaut
so many memories i mean how many times in these hallways was i tripped punched and spit on oh look here’s my old locker i have a masters in engineering and i still can’t figure out how scott kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there kid bumps into him hey
smart we don’t want any problems
i can’t believe i ditched work for disneyland
what did you tell your boss
oh i was very clever i did it in stages at seven o’clock last night i called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned i was going out for seafood at nine thirty i called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird at eleven thirty i called and said i was throwing up like a fire hose at twelve fortyfive i called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds and now i’m going to disneyland
i work at the cheesecake factory i said bye
so what are we gonna do first
i don’t know about you guys but i’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover
you’re kidding right we’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides
come on do it with us
all right whatever how does it work
okay so you pick your princess sleeping beauty snow white cinderella they give you hair makeup the works
guess it would be fun to be cinderella
oh i want to be cinderella too
well it’s simple this was my idea i’m driving i’m cinderella you bitches got a problem with that we could stop the car right now
excuse me i’m meeting a girl here it’s kind of our first date
she and i are both a little awkward in social situations so this seemed like a good idea
people say i’m a little awkward too may i join you
no you can’t join us just go go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from
oh we’re eating here reading we’re having a texting date by text i love that
as you’re reading it will help to remember i have an adorable accent
okay who’s ready for some science me too okay i am dr leonard hofstadter i am here with my friends dr cooper and reallife astronaut howard wolowitz and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be how cool you ask well how about negative 273 degrees ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value did i just learn something new and have fun doing it what all right so now let’s bring out theoretical physicist dr sheldon cooper
hello female children allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist polishborn frencheducated madame curie codiscoverer of radioactivity she was a hero of science until her hair fell out her vomit and stool became filled with blood and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery with a little hard work i see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you are we done can we go
the thing to remember is you can go to outer space too i mean look at me i went to this very school those desks you’re sitting in i was once superglued to one of them
did you go to the moon
no but i did go to the international space station
no but i was in the rocket i didn’t actually…
so you just flew around that’s kind of like my uncle he’s a flight attendant
no i’m an american hero your uncle brings people nuts okay
alright alright boy we are learning a lot here huh thank you astronaut howard um i am what’s called an experimental physicist which is superfun because i get to test theories and work with lasers yes
uh excellent question um i suppose i’ve always been into science you know my mother and father are scientists so i was kind of led in that direction uh pushed might be a better way to describe it to be honest with you guys when i was your age i wanted to be a rap star like snoop dogg but with a healthy respect for the police yeah no sure you laugh just like my mother did after i confided i was derided and chided my moms and i collided she said my dreams were misguided that’s just a little freestyle
my dad’s a gynaecologist in india so if you’re over there and need a check up as he likes to say he’s at your cervix
that’s terrible your dad should be sent to the punitentiary
that’s a fitting punishment i still don’t know what you do for a living
i don’t know you ever look at porn web sites
sorry autocorrect that was supposed to say prom web sites
ooh fun i love prom the romance the gowns it’s like a fairy tale come to life sorry autocorrect that was supposed to say i like sports
i never wanted to play the cello how do you meet girls playing the cello hey you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee
quick pull the fire alarm let’s get out of here
uh hello again um yeah i don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences but it’s clear you young women here today have been while i was listening to my colleagues waste your time it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science and uh i happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now uh dr rostenkowski dr fowler are you there
thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women
it’s our pleasure i’m dr fowler and i’m a neuroscientist
and i’m dr rostenkowski wolowitz and i’m a microbiologist
the world of science needs more women but from a young age we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds
that’s true every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be
unless you want to be cinderella
come at me see what happens
my battery’s dying so i’m just gonna talk thanks for today i’ve been trying to do more things that scare me and coming here was definitely one of them but it was also really nice so thanks and um i’m gonna go maybe i could do one more scary thing before i go and give you a kiss goodbye you know if that’s okay okay panic attack maybe next time
bernie i’m home you have fun today
yes and i have a surprise for you
please be cinderella please be cinderella
i can explain i played hooky with the girls then we all went to disneyland and got… what are you doing
sheldon all snow white needs is one little kiss to wake up
you said clean up i’m cleaning up
you can’t just throw everything in the closet
hey you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it but you can’t do both this isn’t sex
what if someone looks in there
they’re just coming over for dinner no one’s gonna look in the closet
well you don’t know that what if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door
could work out for all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere
fine but after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess
you know what we should do we should show the closet to sheldon
are you kidding he’s like a savant at organizing everything in his apartment has a label on it including his label maker which has a label that says label maker and if you look really close at that label maker label you’ll see a label that says label
he’s our guest we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet
no we wouldn’t ask him we’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there
thanks and sheldon i know tonight’s the night you eat thai food so i went to the asian market got all the ingredients and made it from scratch
no you really shouldn’t have i brought my own
you stopped and got him takeout
i had no choice he kept kicking the back of my seat
sheldon i’ve been cooking all day
well now don’t you feel silly
these spring rolls are amazing good job bernadette
that’s the takeout that sheldon brought
oh well i’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if i hadn’t tried your food first
howard did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour
sheldon aren’t you gonna spend a little time with amy
oh it’s okay i’m used to it the other day at whole foods he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle
yeah and some thanks i got the assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami
his quirks just make you love him more someone please agree with me
sheldon come on it’s getting late time to go
that’s what you said five minutes ago amy and penny are already in the car let’s move it
how come i never get to do anything i want to do
you know if he really wants to stay and finish i can give him a ride home
please leonard he said it’s okay
sheldon it’s wait i can go home without you bye
howard i have a few questions i found three bowling pins now do you juggle these or are you missing seven
oh my god it’s beautiful look he found the juggling pins i hid
uh just a couple more items howard i found this letter from your dad in a box now based on the content it could either be filed…
well i had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia now as i was saying based on the content…
i couldn’t be less interested now come on i’ll take you home
howard don’t you want to know what’s in the letter
if i wanted to know i would’ve opened it years ago the closet looks great let’s get out of here
wait can i bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride
you know when i first met howard he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say aw i sat in gum
well it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now happily married guy throwing dinner parties
really you couldn’t just say that you had to tell the scrotum story
it was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table
mm you know we could throw a dinner party too maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up
sure just when you say dressed up you mean nice clothes right not like capes and tights and crap
told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner i know the little cups make you feel big but it’s not worth it
of course i’m curious i haven’t seen the man since oh i was a little kid and a letter shows up on my 18th birthday what’s that about
why don’t you read it maybe he apologizes or explains why he left
he abandoned me and my mother why does he deserve a chance to explain anything
i get that so what do you want to do with it
something i should have done a long time ago sets fire to it
i do smoke alarm goes off great neither one of us is tall enough to reach that
i can’t believe he set it on fire
yeah just seeing that letter really freaked him out and he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work i don’t know why he was upset they were bigger on him than me
boy i’m really curious what was in that letter
me too but i guess now we’ll never know
well you said sheldon read it why not ask him
i can’t do that what kind of wife would i be if i didn’t respect my husband’s privacy
what if i ask sheldon you just happen to be in the room
bleuch like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button
oh hello what can i do for you ladies
oh dear my mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city
oh oh i’ve got that in spades ravage me
we heard you read the letter from howard’s father
i can’t tell you that i’m bound by closet organizerorganizee confidentiality
sheldon that’s not a real thing
well neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies you know that doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and i’m a trash can full of sweets
why do you even care just tell us what it says
control over the information contained in that letter belongs to howard by happenstance i came to know it that doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely
come on look the letter was found in bernadette’s closet doesn’t that count for something
are you pointing out that california is a community property state and since howard and bernadette are married the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses
well played sometimes i don’t give you enough credit penny
dude you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party
actually all i did was invite you
well put your mind at ease i’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks howard’s dinner party’s ass now the first thing we need is a theme i’m thinking ah turnofthecentury moulin rouge
i’m thinking you need a testosterone patch penny and i just want to do something lowkey you know cocktails light jazz music hors d’oeuvres
so your theme is i saw a rerun of mad men and bought some crab puffs from trader joe’s hate to miss that
oh leonard if i was prone to sarcasm i’d say i was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten i meant golly sheldon you’ve been gone a long time
oh yeah well i was waylaid by penny bernadette and amy they made me reveal confidential information about howard’s father
i can’t tell you that i am bound by closet organizerorganizee confidentiality
well come on we won’t tell anyone
sorry badgering me won’t work what you should have said is it’s pointless to keep this a secret because penny will tell us
all right i’ll tell you my goodness everyone’s on their game today
yeah it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while
yeah and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful
my shirt is itchy and i wish i were dead
hey uh listen everybody before howard gets here et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father
if i say yes can we turn off that latin orgy music
ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs
yeah try doing it in heels
wait there’s something i have to tell you
i know what was in your dad’s letter
sheldon i swear to god i’m gonna kill you
couldn’t leave him one friend could you
so everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me
yes it’s six against one stand down sir
if you want we could tell you
no i don’t want to know i mean i do but… i got to go
use me as a human shield
i panicked he looked taller than usual
i’m sorry i should have left it alone
it’s okay sorry i ran off like that
uh pictures of my dad and me when i was a kid
i got to tell you as angry as i am at sheldon for blabbing he did a hell of a job organizing this closet look at this photos of wolowitz family before father left forever check out nineyearold howie with cornrows neither race was happy to see me with those
think you could take a break
got a little surprise for you come on
oh honey i am in no mood to have sex tonight i’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it but… oh what are you guys doing here
when you left you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter so we came up with kind of a cool solution
it’s simple really it occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition the the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once
we were all thinking it really it was kind of the elephant in the room so…
anyway um i realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you only one of which is true and then we don’t tell you which one it is you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence
yeah and i said if it wasn’t epistemic we might as well not do it
okay um it was a card for your 18th birthday inside it said happy birthday howard i love you dad oh and it was a far side card the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane thinks it’s a fly silly frog so funny
it was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate oneeyed willy
nice try that’s the plot for goonies
you didn’t know it but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation and he cried because he was so proud of you
or that’s complete poppycock which amy made up it still could be the map
it was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was eventually his other life caught up to him and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave
i would like to change mine the pirate’s name was pegleg antoine now it’s completely different from goonies
okay my turn your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing and that you should never throw it away like he did
inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born on the back he wrote howard my son my greatest gift you okay
so which one do you think it is matey
actually i don’t want to know i want all of them to be true
that’s pretty cool thank you guys
hey it’s still early why don’t we go back and have that party
you know surprisingly uh the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing i read in the closet bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages
there’s nothing to worry about your secret’s safe with me
although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review
me too if i’d known we were gonna be dancing would have worn my flats
this turned out pretty well huh
i agree that is if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before
if you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place you’d be happy all the time
uh penny i i have a couple of questions about your closet is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish
damn i forgot to feed him and that i had him
well now did you also have a dog because i found what appears to be a batteryoperated chew toy
i was reading about this jellyfish that never dies instead it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again
we thought my 90yearold grandfather had reverted to an asexual state but the lawsuit from his jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong
my point is immortality is not only a possibility it is real
only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm
if i could keep my gmail account i’d be okay with that
wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom pwofessor tupperman’s office was
turns out it was tupperman dead at his desk for two weeks
in wieu of fwowers the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of febweze
if we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish i’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle
show a little compassion a man died
and turned into a puddew of goo now we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up i choose to do the watter
excuse me the whole tenure system is ridiculous a guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent if we really want science to advance people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid
well i believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure
if you need my nose you’ll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee
you phd’s gonna go suck up like kripke
no i mean i’ll apply but i’m not gonna stoop to playing politics
yeah me neither it should be about the work and if i can’t get tenure i’d like to see you or sheldon get it
raj don’t dangle false hope in front of leonard like that
excuse me but i think i’m just as qualified as you are
so tenured means a job for life
you can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it
wow sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the cheesecake factory
while i disagree with the premise of tenure if they gave it to me it wouldn’t diminish my output you know i’m like the sun can’t turn this off
are rajesh and leonard competing for it as well
do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great
well put you know i must say i go back and forth on this boyfriendgirlfriend thing but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running
it would be nice to have the increased income stop taking money from my parents
money from family does come with strings attached
you have no idea they buy me a new bmw for my birthday but can i get seat warmers no rajesh if you want a warm butt you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself well maybe i will old man
i think that’s enough wine for now
i just keep thinking about how cool it would be if i called my mom and told her that i got tenure at caltech
oh very assuming she takes my call
my primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact i might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow or a chainsaw
or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out buy a house get married start a family
and i will return to new delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant and you know what will be on that elephant’s back a seat warmer no father you may not have a ride
so who do you have to schmooze to get this deal
i’m not gonna schmooze anybody i’m gonna let my work speak for itself
that’s great that shows a lot of integrity
thank you i’m a naive idiot right
you know if you really want tenure maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision
sheldon cooper does not do cozy
but i suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee let’s see oh janine davis oh dear
i’m not sure it could go either way
yeah just thought i’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season
not that you need it i bet you look great in a swimsuit
i’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease my chest is falling into my drawers i’m not uh familiar with this model how do i make it start
right this one might be broken
got it oh there oh yeah yeah now i’m feeling it oh this is great i could do this for the rest of my life hey speaking speaking of things you do for the rest of your life uh did i read that you’re on thatthat tenure committee
yep i got to get a home gym
well i’m sure you have a lot of good applicants i just wanted to say hi and let you know that i’ll be throwing my hat in the ring
all right i’ll keep an eye out for that
hey hofstadter funny seeing you here for the first time in… ever
janine the machine wet’s do this
well look at that burned a whole calorie
i guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead i baked you
yeah it was delicious thank you
oh if you if you like banana bread i’ve got aa great recipe the trick is in in fresh ground i’ll email it to you
aw wight i’m warm weady to kick it up a notch
that’s enough cardio for me i’m just gonna stretch out before i hit the weights
good day mrs davis this is dr rajesh koothrappali from the astrophysics department don’t be alarmed i’m not really in space anyhoo i’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself so sit back relax and enjoy the following 90minute video
born in new delhi the third son of an itinerant gynecologist i showed early signs of genius at the age of five i discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon
god they’re everywhere come in dr cooper how can i help you
yes hello i’m fine um i understand you may have a bad impression of me so i bought you a gift
uh dr cooper that’s not necessary
it’s too late get ready to like me
the tragic history of slavery in america fun for the whole family
why would you think this is an appropriate gift
um… well… you are black right
this meeting has come to an end
because you want to start watching it right now copy that let’s see up next on the tenure committee is professor wu well get ready for the complete works of jackie chan
asthma heart some kind of attack i’m fine though
you guys going to professor tupperman’s memorial
yeah you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brownnosing the tenure committee who will all be there oh yeah that’s what i was hoping for meerkats
i won’t be able to make our date night this thursday so bad news for you
well you better have a good excuse this time because trimming qtips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense
first of all when you say things like that people think you’re crazy second the reason i’m cancelling is because i have to attend a memorial service for professor tupperman
it sounds like a long and tedious evening
eh it will be honestly if i must endure a long and tedious evening i’d rather it be with you on date night but i have no choice the tenure committee’s going to be there
oh well in that case perhaps i should come along
well now that i think about it that would be most helpful
of course it would i’m wellversed in academic politics and as a respected scientist i can only raise your stock as a candidate
actually i meant you could drive me but if it makes you happy that other stuff too
oh not really i was out shopping with amy she wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing
wait sheldon’s going to be there we all promised we weren’t going to go
i know i was hoping to go without anyone finding out
well since amy’s going do you want me there you know to support you
oh that’s nice but itit’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and i’m not sure how much help you’d be
okay i’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that
oh yeah no thanks that would be great help you realize you might kill some of them
oh then you all can get tenure
come on daddy all the other scientists have seat warmers this is so humiliating i’ve got to get tenure okay let’s meet halfway how about i cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week looks like we’re both going to be living like animals
let’s go over our emotional responses one last time
professor tupperman is dead and that makes us
the fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic it makes us
giving mrs davis the box set of roots was
unbelievable you have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee
excuse me i’m here to pay my respects to professor tupperware or whatever his name is
so am i his passing makes me feel bad
well well well sheldon fancy meeting you here i guess the train store in glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all and you you said you weren’t coming here either
i have a thick accent you don’t know what i said
i’d like to know why penny’s here
i’m here to support my man just like you
what are you going to do take people’s drink orders and get them wrong
what did she do it yet
she plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further leonard’s cause
well that’s a fine howdoyoudo don’t just stand there take your breasts out
you’re all wasting your time sheldon is the most qualified for the job and no amount of gravitydefying bosom’s going to change that seriously is that tape like how are they staying up like that
way to hit ’em with both barrels
you two should be ashamed of yourselves using women to advance your cause with sexuality and whatever amy plans on doing
are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit
okay because that was not clear
well now it’s biguous what are you gonna do about it
you could talk some smack about his mother
well yes of course he wouldn’t like that at all last night i was feeling in need of sexual release when i happened to come across your mother
okay okay guys what are we doing here
i don’t know what you’re doing but i was about to insinuate that i had coitus with raj’s mother for a dollar
oh you do what you want but i don’t want to lose my friends over tenure friends are forever
i’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself
you’re right this is beneath me lie your mother was last night
what do you think i should do
well you’ll always be an academic success but i seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends
i don’t want any more but let’s go
are you kidding i would wove to babysit for you
i could not ask you to do that
nonsense childwen wove me something about me just makes them waugh and waugh
no we cannot lose to that jerk
yeah screw it i’m going in
wait hold on i believe screw it i’m going in is what i said to your mother last night don’t worry i didn’t really say that i find the concept of coitus ridiculous and offputting
should have taken my breasts out while i had the chance
knock knock knock mrs davis knock knock knock mrs davis knock knock knock mrs davis i know you’re in there i saw your car in the parking lot
i just found out that you recommended myself dr hofstadter and dr koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure
well despite your quirks the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields
i don’t know what you mean by quirks but um i do want to express my gratitude
you didn’t bring another gift did you
no no no i learned my lesson i understand that was inappropriate
you’re welcome sheldon attempts a jive handshake i’m gonna pretend that didn’t happen
oh dear penny have you been recording shows on our dvr again
answer honestly this is not a trial that’ll come later
absolutely not help me out here i can’t afford another demerit
yeah uh maybe we were hacked you know the chinese have been hacking everything lately
why would the chinese make our dvr record paul blart
i don’t know it’s a fat guy on a segway that’s funny everywhere
well hang on maybe the chinese haven’t finished watching it yet
you know if you’re trying to make space on the dvr why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched like um alphas
no that’s the season two finale that was quite the cliffhanger i’m going to rewatch it before season three starts
there is no season three they cancelled that show
well they can’t cancel it it ended on a cliffhanger
uh sheldon there are two dumplings left do you want them
dumplings don’t you understand what’s going on here
that show ended with all the residents of new york either dead or unconscious oh now i’ll never know what happened
well why don’t you make up your own ending
oh sure what a wonderful idea and after that i’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene you know instead of flossing i’ll rub pudding on my gums i’m going to get the number of the syfy channel and give them what for
no they can’t just cancel a show like alphas you know they have to help the viewers let go firefly did a movie to wrap things up buffy the vampire slayer continued on as a comic book heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended
i feel bad for whoever gets that phone call
ah don’t if they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds they shouldn’t have started a scifi channel
i think you’re gonna be really happy with this security camera the optics are great it’s got infrared technology and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out
whatever i can see my little princess while i’m at work right
why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy i need your laptop so i can configure the software
wait hold on this is weird
i was googling that girl i’ve been dating and i found her blog
she said she recently went on a date with a guy named roger and he’s indian and he’s an astrophysicist too
you know what’s going on don’t you
yes mummy was right american girls are sexually voracious devils
i can’t believe i have to explain this people change names on blogs to protect their privacy roger is raj
oh i always thought if i had a white name it would be gavin
keep reading what does it say
no no i don’t know if i should if she wanted me to know about her blog she would’ve told me it’s almost like i’m reading her diary
it’s exactly what it’s like keep reading
oh i think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when i put up that camera
it’s not creepy don’t listen to him oh look who’s got the sweetest kisses
with all the tv sheldon was talking about i had the greatest idea ever it even blows away my idea for a star wars themed coffee shop called brewbacca’s you need to watch buffy the vampire slayer it is the perfect show for the two of us it’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance i cannot oversell this what do you say
it’s six thirty in the morning
i thought you grew up on a farm
hello syfy network yeah this is your vice president of programming now we have made a horrible mistake regarding alphas yeah we need to uncancel it immediately well you just put me through to the people who handle that you tell them it’s me and i don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if i really am who i say i am you know i just i want this done no i am not the person who just called that man was clearly a cowboy yeah who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show why do they keep hanging up on me
i’m sorry you’re upset you know sheldon sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this
i am not flying back to texas just so my mom can give me a hug
okay well what i think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure
oh that’s nonsense i mean you tell me stories about your day all the time i don’t care how they end
you know i might be able to help you with this there’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less
yeah but i just told you i don’t have a problem with closure
oh quite sure amy starts a knocking sequence on the table after staring at her a moment sheldon completes it that proves nothing
i broke down and i read lucy’s blog and in one of the entries she said when we first met i struck her as a little feminine
i have to talk to her about this
oh geez why do you girls always want to talk about things listen to me if she’s writing about your relationship use it to your advantage rig the game
is it fair that girls like confident normal guys more than nervous weirdos
no it’s not i’ve always thought that was unfair
so take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off
why do you have to make everything so filthy why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart
the key to her heart that’s nice were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back
i was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women sir elton john
so did you love it of course you loved it how could you not love it tell me how much you loved it
oh don’t say cute that’s the worst
it just makes things seem small it diminishes them
so you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute
you can try but nobody’s gonna believe you i just i don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it
what do you want from me
you know what never mind we gave it a shot let’s just see what else is on
oh come on don’t be like that
i’m sorry i called it cute let’s watch another one
yeah it was fun kind of reminded me of my high school but instead of vampires we had meth heads but both came out at night and had messed up teeth
all right cool i think you’ll like the next one better all the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse
oh well that’s like my high school too but instead of a curse it was crabs
i’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure
i take issue with the word compulsive
all i’m saying is we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…
…tion okay for the sake of argument let’s say i have a problem what would be your plan for addressing it
i’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming
oh amy and you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies tictactoe can only end in win lose or draw none of which will deny me closure especially since i’m about to win she wipes the board clean bbut we didn’t finish
exactly how does that make you feel
the same way any normal person would i feel like i want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until i have a handful of sheldonface confetti
and that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment
or you could pitch in grab a nostril and help me get this face off
come on you can do this
you don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated to have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release
okay help me out here why does he love this show so much
well there was action it was funny i mean you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters
yippee it’s backwards i get it
why does this bother you so much
i don’t know it’s just he’s so passionate about so many different things i just don’t get that way do you
well sure i’m pretty passionate about science i remember the first time i looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms it was like a whole other universe if i wanted to i could wipe it out with my thumb like a god
see i wish i had some of that fire in my life i mean i want to care about things and get excited like you guys
well there’s no reason you can’t
absolutely all we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about
ugh that sounds like a lot of work
uh lucy’s coming over i need some advice
however long you think the foreplay should be triple it
just tell me which one you think is more manly this hockey jersey or this football jersey
i don’t know go with hockey
good black is more slimming oh that’s her i got to go be butch toodles hey
oh look how cute your little doggy is
yeah well i wouldn’t get too close if i give the right command in german she’ll rip your face off
lucky for you ’cause i wished you were dead
oh cool so does my dad we watched it all the time growing up who’s your favourite player
not brian boitano that’s for sure how’s your burrito
it’s still a little frozen in the middle
probably because i didn’t read the instructions no wrapper’s going to tell me what to do unless his name is jayz
well you’re acting all weird and i’m pretty weird so i think i know what i’m talking about
i don’t know maybe it’s all those steroids i’ve been taking
i think i’m gonna go thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks
wait wait i i found your blog here you wrote about me
oh i kind of just write that for myself i didn’t think anybody actually read it
no kidding you didn’t make it easy to find i spent hours digging around online for the record you have excellent credit scores and your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine
why were you acting so strange tonight
you called me feminine and i i wanted you to think i was more manly
raj i didn’t say feminine was a bad thing i meant that you’re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel i just want to dip an apple in your face
i do have a pretty ballstothewall moisturising regimen
good do you even like hockey
no bought this at the staples center when i went to see taylor swift
so i was thinking how excited you get about stuff like buffy or science or which tv remote you and sheldon should buy
the harmony one was fine we didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred which he knows is too big for my hand
see that’s the kind of passion i didn’t think i had but then i realized i’m passionate about you
oh my cute little tushy strikes again
no i’m serious look i’ve always had these plans i was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about
oh obviously it’s gonna happen yeah a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so anyway what i meant was i shouldn’t wait you know i’ve got you i’ve got sheldon all these wonderful friends my life is exciting right now
so does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to comiccon
leonard i had an epiphany not a stroke
amy i must say i was sceptical at first but this has truly been a transformative evening
i’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive
well you’re an excellent neuroscientist you’re a wonderful girlfriend and…
i’m proud of you sheldon exits
sheldon you big weirdo i want you to know that i love that you’re in my life
hello uh is this the bruce miller who wrote the season finale of alphas oh smashing yeah you already sound nicer than the last bruce miller who suggested i have sexual relations with myself now down to business um your show ended on a cliffhanger could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it uhhuh mmhmm i see well that all stinks no wonder you got cancelled bye
the interface is pretty simple you put your horizontal x coordinate here vertical y coordinate here when you’re happy with those you press this button
leonard you’ll never guess who i just found online hey
eh his giant head did most of the work
very mature you’re lucky i’m out of silly string as i was saying leonard you’ll never guess who i just found online professor proton
he was the host of this great… hey
yes sorry tell me about professor proton
professor proton hosted my favourite science show when i was a child i never missed an episode he demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects
aw so cute when you use the word cool wrong like when kids say pasghetti
oh dear lord leonard look he’s still available for parties and events we should hire him
well whatever we want hang out do experiments make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar
it would be pretty awesome to hang out with him i just used awesome wrong didn’t i
well i’m emailing him right now
do you remember his old theme song
grab your goggles put your lab coat on here he comes professor proton
hey i just found out i have to be at the telescope lab all weekend any chance you and bernadette could take care of my dog
why don’t you put her in a kennel
why don’t you put your mother in a home
to be honest she’d do better in the kennel i’ll talk to bernie i’m sure it’s fine
it’s happening leonard it’s happening professor proton is coming to our house
you mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show
and you just got yourself uninvited see i told you i’d find a tactful way to do that
how’d you get him to come to your house
as professor proton always says there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin
and he wrote him a cheque
uncle howard cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party
you know if you had a stroke she’d eat you right
and it would be my pleasure to be her numnum
okay so what do i need to know to take care of her
it’s very simple for breakfast she has an eggwhite frittata feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an english muffin but not both we’re watching our weight uh for dinner something simple a veal chop some scampi whatever you like
yes also don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it
well i can so shut up
do you realize that in less than nine hours arthur jeffries aka professor proton will be in our apartment
sheldon you know that if you stay up all night you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow and a sleepy sheldon is a cranky sheldon and a cranky sheldon is actually no different than a regular sheldon good night
i’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo
ah just as well where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning
nice to meet you professor proton nice to meet you professor proton nice to meet you professor proton nice to meet you prof… ow leonard
she really tuckered herself out at the park huh
yeah you two were so cute playing together
it was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me
and you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs
yeah that’s what i was doing
you know there were a few moments today when i almost felt like we were a little family
yeah i never thought of myself as a mom but when the three of us were out there having fun i felt like maybe someday we could do it
of course we can especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little cinna… son of a bitch she’s gone
i don’t know she didn’t leave a note
well you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller
yeah well you throw like a girl
relax sheldon he’s only a few minutes late
professor proton was never late when he was on tv you know every day four o’clock he was there unless tornadoes were ripping apart east texas in which case we’d join him in progress phone rings it’s him hello well i see yes all right we can come get you yeah well see you soon bye
the third floor landing the poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour it’s really you
mr jeffries i am so sorry we should’ve told you about the broken elevator
professor proton it’s an honour to meet you
leonard you hear that professor proton said i should call him arthur that means we’re friends
no a friend would’ve would’ve told me about the elevator
look at me i can get as close to you as i want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes
mr jeffries i’m i’m leonard this is my girlfriend penny
well i hope i haven’t uh kept the kids waiting too long for for the show
oh no there are no kids no the the show’s for me come on i’ll race ya arthur
is the is the blonde girl really your your girlfriend
so do you do a lot of appearances like this
it it’s hard to say i’m i’m still trying to figure out what what th what this is
we just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life
well there there really isn’t too much to tell after the tv show was was cancelled nobody in the scientific world would uh would take me seriously so i was forced to do these uh children’s parties to to make a living
that’s too bad but still working with kids it must be rewarding
you you get bit a lot let me see if if i have this straight you you two are are physicists and you and you want me to do a children’s science show
yes and if there’s time take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing
you know i’m a real scientist i i have a phd from cornell university
yeah that’s great did you bring your puppet
no no i i hate that puppet
oh no how could anybody hate gino the neutrino it’s nice huh i got him for 20 bucks on ebay including the shipping
i’m i’m awake right th this is happening
you know maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of raj’s accent
good thinking in a bad indian accent cinnamon come to daddy
cinnamon where are you my little lamb chop
when this all blows over remember that voice it’s kind of a turnon
it turns you on when i sound like raj
okay as as i put the egg on top and and the flame goes out and and and the air pressure decreases in in the flask what do you think will happen
it’s gonna get sucked in it’s going to get sucked in
see i’m not a scientist like them
i i power a clock with a with a potato
shut up you can do that i mean wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis
no look guys keep your money i i think uh i i think i’m done
what well what’s wrong is she upsetting you because i can make her go away
no she she’s the only reason i’ve i’ve stayed this long
i don’t know i think i’m just i i just i just don’t want to be professor proton any more
well how can you say that professor proton’s the best
what what has it ever gotten me i mean i’m i’m an 83yearold man who has potatoes in in his suitcase other scientists think think i’m a joke and the the puppeteer who did who did gino well he also did my wife
mr jeffries i need to show you something
i’m sorry to hear about your troubles
but if you don’t mind me asking uh the potato clock how does it work is it a trick clock or a trick potato
what do you two talk about
i wrote a fan letter to you when i was a child in texas and you sent this autographed picture back to me do you remember that
i’ll i’ll give you a hint i have a bracelet with my own address on it
well anyway um you may find this hard to believe but i didn’t have any friends growing up
but um i did have you and every day at four o’clock you’d come to my house on channel 68 and we’d do science together if it hadn’t been for you well who knows what would’ve become of me you know instead of a worldclass physicist i could’ve wound up as a hobo or a surgeon
i bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science in a way their discoveries are your discoveries
yeah it’s true a generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders
well thank thank you guys that that that means a lot
it’s important you know how much you mean to us
i’m having a problem with my pacemaker
any chance we could plug it into the potato
hello what do you mean you found my dog she’s with my friends is she okay oh thank you uh just text me your address i’m on my way oh and if she’s hungry go ahead and feed her but do not give her anything starchy she’s having risotto for dinner
you want one of us to go with you in the ambulance
he’s not a relative he’s not allowed right
i can’t catch a break today
we’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital
i’m sorry things turned out this way
well at at this point i’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs
met my childhood hero now i get to ride in an ambulance boy if we can get him to do that calendar this’ll be the best day ever
can’t believe we lost her what was i thinking i’d be a terrible mom
well maybe with the first one but kids are like pancakes the first one’s always a throwaway how’s this look
it’s fine where’d you get that picture of her
it’s not her i just googled foofoo little dogs skype tone it’s raj stay quiet hey bad timing bernadette just took cinnamon out for a walk
hmm interesting did they take a walk down liars’ lane
a lane frequented by liars like you you big liar
well i trusted you and you let me down the poor thing’s been shaking for hours
hang on you’ve had her for hours
yes i picked her up and then we both went for massages to try and calm down and then we got pinkberry
so you knew she was okay and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us
don’t well me mister we’ve been worried sick she could have been dead for all we knew you should be ashamed of yourself
sorry’s not good enough maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done

oh you’re not you look awful
thank you anyway uh i mean you know my act better than anybody i was i was hoping that maybe you know maybe you’d fill in for me
are you saying that you want me to be professor proton
oh my what an honour oh this is like being asked to ascend mount olympus and dine with the gods
or a korean family in alhambra
but they’ll know i’m not you should i call myself professor proton jr
so in a way it’s like i’m your son
no husbands no boyfriends no rules
no rules we’re not gonna get drunk and have a sixway with the blue man group are we
fine no husbands no boyfriends some rules
the ladies are away the boys will play

i got some old underwear i’m gonna throw on stage at the garth brooks concert
‘cause last time i saw him i threw new ones and it got me nothing
i’ve got a brandnew seven piece set of polyhedral dice hello new dice smell

come on are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls or are we gonna play dd like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls
i’m actually glad lucy had to work tonight saved me the awkward conversation about how i was gonna be hanging with my bros
isn’t every conversation you two have awkward
painfully so we have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes you can just hang up so into her
yeah yeah we’ll be right there leonard
i’m not sure how i feel about howard being dungeon master instead of you
oh that’s nice but relax sometimes change is good uh you were worried about zachary quinto being the new spock but you wound up liking him
oh please every time the topic of change comes up you throw zachary quinto in my face i’m upset the mailman has a new haircut zachary quinto i’m upset that daylight saving time started zachary quinto i’m upset daylight saving time ended zachary quinto i’m saying this for the last time zachary quinto was a weird wonderful unrepeatable event so stop using him against me
okay here we go you find yourselves in an overgrown old forest before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like nicolas cage he says nicolas cage voice travel with caution these woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero
see howard’s just as good a dungeon master as i am
as good you just got pantsed in the schoolyard foureyes
hey come on guys focus um uh oh mighty nicolas cage tree we thank you for your warning but we are brave warriors and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal text sound oh lucy’s free after all see ya
hey hey hey you can’t leave we just started
you’re right i should finish the game i take my plusone long sword stab myself in the face with it i’m dead i’ve got a date with a girl bye
we’ll be fine watch suddenly a spectral shape rises from koothrappali’s bloody corpse and says raj voice don’t worry buddies ghost raj will help guide you through the forest nicolas cage voice well i’m just a tree but if i were you i’d listen to your ghost friend
go on give him your lunch money
i’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight
not that it’s up to you to make me happy uh well unless you find neediness sexy in which case you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet
can i tell you something i was so nervous about seeing you before i left my apartment i put rollon antiperspirant all over my body
yeah if sweat starts squirting out the top of my head you’ll know why
i uh i’m sorry to put you through that
oh it’s okay i’ve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared
what else have you been thinking about doing
well let’s see i’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that i don’t like bangs
oh thanks i like ’em too
mmm it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines doortodoor
mm yeah those are both toughies
i know i have a twoyear subscription to guns  ammo53
i push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way
hey i always did sound effects aa swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon clicking sounds uh uh they attack a nearby unicorn strange howl
okay well i have a sound effect for those sound effects blows raspberry
uh well when we were going through security i got pulled out of line for a patdown the uh tsa agent got a little handsy i may have broken her nose with my elbow
long story short she’s on the no fly list and we might have been followed here by a drone
i’m sorry i feel like such an idiot
oh it’s not so bad you lost money you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger i mean that’s vegas you nailed it
you guys enjoy your evening i’m gonna go before i ruin anybody else’s weekend
no no no amy wait i know it’s not the night you had in mind but why don’t you guys stay and play with us it’ll be fun
it would fun okay three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter now you want the girls to play dd do you have a drug problem
what’s the big deal raj bailed so we could use some extra players
well i’ve just never played dungeons  dragons with girls before
oh don’t worry sweetie no one has
i’ll leave it up to the dungeon master
a satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like al pacino rises from the forest floor and says al pacino voice you’re playing dd you’re playing dd this whole apartment is playing dd
yeah we now penny we don’t consume alcohol during dungeons  dragons it impairs our judgment
oh this isn’t alcohol it’s a magic potion that makes me like you
okay here we go you find yourselves facetoface with two hulking ogres what are you doing in our dungeon you shall die
i say we attack the big one
you know what give me the dice i want to roll
the dungeon master’s supposed to roll
yeah well i’m supposed to be in vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet now give it all right what do i need
fifteen’s the point the point is fifteen give the little lady some room here it is coming out sixteen yes oh please tell me we’re playing for money
oh even better than money you gained experience points
it is does funky mean something different in india
no no uh you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant here’s your chance
mmm it’s okay i just won’t eat ’em
uh yeah everything all right with you
hold on isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him
nno it it’s fine uh he’s from a different country he doesn’t understand our ways
don’t be silly just tell him
i have to go to the bathroom and it’s not because the crab cakes are funky
uh yeah sorry she’s just a little shy the first time we met she was so nervous she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me
uhoh dials phone hey raj funny story
come on mama wants a pair of dead ogres
seventeen the larger ogre is dead thethe other ogre says you killed my brother now ogre thanksgiving is ruined
that is amazing he made me care about the ogre
all right amy there’s one ogre left take him out
pretend he’s that tsa agent come on
nineteen yes this is turning out to be even better than vegas
you don’t know me very well but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company it chips away at my masculinity
why would you leave like that
you were pushing me i clearly didn’t want to send my food back and you tried to make me do it anyway
okay if i upset you then why didn’t you just say something
well how can i tell you i’m upset if i can’t tell the woman at supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature it’s scary
yeah well i like you a lot and that’s scary for me mostly because you’re a proven flight risk
how could you like me a lot
well uh for one thing you have bigger emotional problems than i do and i find that very attractive in a woman i i don’t know i just i think you’re wonderful
i’m sweating out of my head
the dragon falls from the sky crashing into the volcano
but wait he’s not dead he crawls out spreads his wings and prepares to attack
yeah uh wait doesn’t he say something first you know maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity
fine christopher walken voice you’d think after all these years i’d know not to fly over volcanoes i’m a freaking idiot
the dragon’s christopher walken that’s perfect
all right amy it’s your turn we need one more hit finish him off
it’s a hit the dragon collapses to the ground
mother is that you your little boy is coming home
oh i don’t know about you guys but i have been through the emotional wringer tonight
this may be the potion talking but you are one fineass dungeon master
oh yeah well when we get home i’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure
another quest by wolowitz count me in
ooh i have an idea since it’s not happening any time soon why don’t your character and your character do it in the game
ooh come on back me up here
okay i cast a love spell on sheldon and amy
ooh sorry i thought you were gonna do that
the love spell takes effect when sheldon looks at amy she is the most beautiful halforc he’s ever seen and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts when amy sees sheldon he looks well just like sheldon ’cause apparently she’s into that what do you do
you see what happens when you let girls play dd
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
i’ve never knocked on my own door before that was a wild ride
you don’t have to come in here and cheer me up
thank you would you go tell everyone else that because they sure think otherwise
i’ll tell you what they think they think our relationship is a joke
well i don’t think our relationship is a joke i think “a horse goes into a bar bartender says why the long face’ that’s a joke it’s a good one too because a horse has a long face
sheldon are we ever going to have an intimate relationship
oh my that’s an uncomfortable topic amy before i met you i never had any interest in being intimate with anyone
do you have any interest now
i have not ruled it out
i know it doesn’t seem like it to you but for me what we have is extremely intimate
i guess i know that it’s just part of me wants more
more i mean look at us it’s only been three years here we are in bed together
come on let’s go back out there
well no hold on my elven magicuser and your halforc warrior did have a love spell cast on them we wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through
i believe that uh we just killed a dragon while the others pillage the corpse i lead you to a secluded area where i attempt to remove your leather armour rolls dice it comes off
i kiss you on the lips
i kiss you back on the rolls dice lips as well your turn
i remove your armour what do you do
i erotically caress your rolls dice nose
hey you guys have been in there for a while you doing okay
okay we just want to say we feel really bad about…
go away sheldon is nibbling on my sound of dice 14 yes
so anyway last night on video chat i spent like twenty minutes just staring into lucy’s eyes
it was until i realized the screen had frozen still one of my top three dates of all time
so are we ever gonna hang out with this girl
i’d love that but she’s not really comfortable around people
yeah i used to be uncomfortable around people but then i learned a trick i pretend everyone i meet is a beloved character from star trek
how’s that been working for you
oh like a charm unnamed crewman in a red shirt
leonard i may have gotten you a job
yes he does he caters to my every whim
no in a couple of weeks stephen hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the north sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes one of their experimental physicists dropped out and i recommended you
well do you really think i have a shot
yeah i’ve worked with hawking i talked you up he knows your research i think this could happen
well now but do you think that’s a good idea uh you know star trek should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition
hey don’t discourage him this is a fantastic opportunity
would you like to hear a classic sheldon cooper factoid
great i’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats
interesting that you would bring that up when i might go work on a boat
well that’s the thing about factoids they’re interesting
i know what you’re doing you don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone
i’m not afraid to be alone on land on the sea it would be terrifying because of all the drowning
fine no more drowning talk i’ll change the subject oh who do you think would win in a fight you or a shark
look i appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness if i get the chance to do this there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me
very well things between you and penny have never been better i hope four months apart doesn’t change anything i should have opened with that huh
if you look carefully at venus you should be able to see the international space station pass by
wow your friend was actually up there
yeah he brought me back a tshirt that said my friend went to the space station and all i got was this lousy tshirt
did he take the tshirt to space
nope it’s exactly as lousy as advertised speaking of friends they have been asking to meet you i was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime
i don’t know how many are there
let’s see six that’s pretty cool i have six friends kind of like sinatra
six strangers that’s a lot of pressure staring at me asking me personal questions like what do you do where are you from why did you lock yourself in the bathroom
okay how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them
well that’s two three if you count me oh this is getting out of hand
so then during my afternoon shift i spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself
not really my shirt was soaking wet i got like the biggest tip of my life
so listen do you remember when i said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of unruh radiation in a large body of water
i thought i said that to you
anyway stephen hawking’s team is looking into that and i’ve been invited to join them
well it is just you know i’d be gone for a while
wow oh okay well i’ll just come visit you
that’s the thing you can’t i’ll be on a ship in the north sea
on a ship aren’t they afraid hawking will just roll overboard
uh he’s not gonna be there he’s just sending a team to research his theory
oh sure like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub wow okay four months
yeah and i’m a little worried because things between us have been so great and i’d hate to do anything that screws that up
oh sweetie if you’re gonna screw things up it’s gonna be while you’re here not while you’re away no i mean look you have to go it sounds like an amazing opportunity and i’m just basing that on how much i didn’t understand what you said about it
okay i’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning
i do have to ask you one favour
sheldon’s nervous about me leaving just keep an eye on him while i’m gone
oh i don’t know remember what happened when i took care of your goldfish
well flush sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one
really you guys do not need to throw me a goingaway party
are you kidding me how often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage
hello amy nice to see you what can i say it’s funnier with the accent
there’s beer in the fridge anyway you guys really don’t need to make a big deal
leonard you’re being selfish we need to give you a proper sendoff so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face
you know one of the things that helped me get through howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left
okay i have a request to make
and now he can talk i want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there
the only person allowed inside this head is dr phil anyway i i spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one
oh gee i don’t know my schedule’s a little busy
oh thank you raj i’d be honoured
what the hell i thought i was your best friend
you are but you’ve got kind of a big personality with your flashy clothes and your woody allen swagger
you know maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first
well you’re very pretty that could be intimidating to another woman
hey you don’t think i’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend
calm down bernie you’re very scary
why so you can make jokes about cutting open my brain
a that was not a joke that was a sincere request and b more importantly i was the outsider to this group and i know how frightening that can be but you guys took me in and made me feel loved like i was family
so after i started dating sheldon i met leonard and then everybody else and they’ve all been so wonderful to me
maybe next week we could all get together
oh lucy you don’t have to answer that don’t put her on the spot she hates that am i right tell her how much you hate being put on the spot go ahead tell her
ignore him he’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think i understand the severity of your social anxiety
what the are you crazy you can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety it makes them socially anxious
excuse me but i’m a neurobiologist i think i’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain
don’t call her my girlfriend we haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet now that it’s out there are you my girlfriend by the way if you say no i’ll never be happy again not to put you on the spot
i think i have to go to the bathroom
we might as well go ahead and eat she’s not coming back anytime soon
this is ridiculous we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section
yeah it does and here we are
you know i have to say penny i don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging leonard to do this
well i’m his girlfriend of course i’m gonna support him
yeah well you’re his girlfriend for now you know maybe you’re not aware of this but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches
honey this is a big deal for leonard okay he gets to work with stephen hawking who by the way will not be on the boat i checked it out
it’s not that big of an opportunity and even if hawking’s theories are correct all they prove is where the universe came from why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be i mean me i’m interested in the big questions
oh my god sheldon the genius is jealous of leonard
i’m not jealous i’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me
look sweetie this is a natural thing to feel okay but just because good things are happening to leonard doesn’t take anything away from you you know what let me tell you a little story once there was a girl who worked at the cheesecake factory and she wasn’t very good at her job
it wasn’t me but she was also an actress and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial she got it look i was so jealous but instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
you ripped out your own fake blonde hair
i looked her in the eye smiled and said i’m happy for you because that’s what friends do
they lie so they don’t look petty
like this i am so happy for you
wow no wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial
i want to apologize for amy last night she was completely out of line are you are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again
okay i know it was me i i pushed too hard i’m sorry
you know i i’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody oneonone is too intense so friday night my friends are having a party
a little one it’s it’s a farewell for leonard so all the attention will be on him if you wear something brown and sit on the couch they won’t even know you’re there
come on don’t make me beg and i’m from india so i know how to do it
yeah thank you this means a lot to me my friends are like my family unless you don’t like them in which case they’re dead to me
so have you ever spent a long time on a boat before
are you referring to the time we got stuck on the small world ride at disneyland
i’m proud of you leonard working out on the north sea for months that’s really something
i know as far as science goes this is the adventure of a lifetime
maybe your lifetime i went to space
you’re right you’re right i’m really proud of you and i’m gonna miss you when you’re gone and space beats water
rajesh i thought lucy was coming
she is she’s just running a little late you know how it is girls always fussing about their hair their makeup she’ll be here just give it a rest okay
um can i have your attention everyone clinks glass that’s uh bflat for those who don’t have perfect pitch i would like to propose a toast to my best friend dr leonard hofstadter he has been presented with a wonderful opportunity and i couldn’t be happier for him
thank you sheldon that must’ve been very hard for you to say
well i mean it i’m really happy for you and that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial cheers
it was really nice of you to try to be happy for leonard
it must’ve killed you when i went to space
raj i can’t come to the party this is all just too much for me i don’t think we should see each other any more sorry lucy
it did not kill me when you went to space monkeys went to space
yep i’m really gonna miss you
penny we’re in the red zone the white zone is for loading and unloading we’re breaking the law
okay there’s no space in the white zone so…
anyway we can email and i think the phone connections are pretty good
all right you have to get out of the car right now i’m not going to jail for you
oh i see a space in the white zone quick circle the airport
and uh extra dramamine you remember what happened on it’s a small world
oh dear lord a police officer’s glancing in our direction we’ve been made
calm down i’m getting out i have something i want to give you
it’s just a heartshaped locket with a picture of leonard’s face in it he got it at the mall on clearance now move move move
don’t worry officer they just love each other we’re not smuggling drugs
raj it’s penny are you in there
hey i’m just coming back from the airport i wanted to see how you’re doing
that’s that’s very nice of you uh come come come on in
can’t stay long i left sheldon in the car with the window cracked open he’s gonna go through that activity book in like 30 seconds so… are you okay
no it’s my fault you know i finally found someone who was right for me and i i drove her away
penny i i miss her already
i know how you feel i miss leonard too
what’s like what is wrong with me why why can’t i ever have love
no i i won’t i’m i’m unlovable
no it’s not i haven’t had a drink since last night
i am and now i’m crying for a whole different reason
so i guess what i’m saying is i get where lucy’s coming from
that’s great do you want some wine
uh no water’s fine anyhow i’ve been thinking about it a lot and and i totally see why lucy did what she did i pushed too hard but you know what if i back off and give her enough space maybe there’s still a future for us yeah the funny thing about life is that you know sometimes…
… but then it turns good again and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while i know that now thing’s aren’t good they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal slowly but surely and oh how i cried it was like a little uh thunderstorm on my face but i’m a man okay so i need to pull myself together pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal i mean it’s not all bad right having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you so you know a silver lining…
sheldon it’s not a great time what do you want
hello to you too i’m sorry but this is important
back to the future ii was in the back to the future iii case and back to the future iii was get this in the back to the future ii case
so did you do that or am i in the house with an intruder
sheldon i got to go inside it’s getting rough out here
you’re dodging the question i knew it was you what was that
this isn’t a very good connection but it sounded like someone just released a kraken
okay i’m hanging up now you know there’s no such thing as a k… leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by a huge tentacle sheldon wakes up in bed
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
um well i was worried that you might be missing leonard and that might be causing you to have bad dreams like the kind you’d get if you watched clash of the titans right before you went to bed
sweetie did you have a bad dream
back to the future ii was in the back to the future iii case leonard did it
no wait perhaps i should sleep here so you don’t miss leonard as much uh ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it
you know what that would make me feel better thank you
i think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage i saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my exgirlfriend lucy and i didn’t get upset at all
well you should be ’cause she was looking good
dear lord you’re an astronomer although you may have earthly woes get your mind back on the stars gee even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the milky way
everything i say is true now of course the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces so you know pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace
come on you can talk to girls now it shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new
how can i meet someone new when everywhere i look i see lucy’s face tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie
oh will you stop it now listen to me there’s a welcome party for incoming postdocs tonight go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie
you think you’re so cool because your wife is a person
look bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with amy i’ll go with you
you would do that for me
of course you’re my friend i want you to be happy
thanks oh sheldon since amy’s out of town would you like to join us
i want you to be happy too but not enough to do anything about it
howie stop i can’t talk like that amy’s right here
sheldon stop for the last time i will not bring home bed bugs
the hotel’s nice there’s a pool a gym the bar looks like fun
because i looked in the bed and there are no bugs
aw i love you too if i don’t talk to you before you go to sleep i’ll meet you in dreamland
good night no i will not consider sleeping in my garment bag
penny did you ever wonder how starfleet captains…
well now that i’ve piqued your interest welcome to the exciting world of 3d chess
why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with leonard and you miss him
you overestimate his significance in my life
do i miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup no do i miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck i don’t think so do i miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using morse code taps out no in morse code on the table
okay i get it i get it you are an emotionless robot
all right let’s just get this stupid game over with
by the way how are you with zippers
well i really need to go to the bathroom and this one’s gone all cattywampus
wow your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting
it is you can download my paper off the university server
i will you can download my paper on the van allen belts from the university server as well
well if you like dry factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence it was bananas
check it out mrs davis from human resources is here she’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment
oh great there go my chances of being sexually harassed
i heard her husband left her for a hot young undergrad
that’s so much better than the old ugly ones
mrs davis nice to see you
you know i recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins
so if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive just remember penguins get cheated on and they’re adorable
it was better when you couldn’t talk to women
i was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory
oh brain lesions are fascinating unless they’re yours then they’re a drag
and to the sick and dying who make it possible
this is fun we never really get to talk shop with penny around we usually just end up talking about boys
which is fine but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation
from the two gentlemen at the bar
oh my gosh boys bought us drinks boys bought us drinks thank you thank you thank you so much
you be cool guys are hitting on us and not just to get to penny
my queen can now take your rook from below
so that means i lose right it’s over
if i make this move but i won’t because we’re having too much fun
i wasn’t going to get alcohol gosh i wonder what leonard’s doing right now i miss him so much
well if you’d like we could call him i mean that you could call him as i’ve explained the absence of my friends does not cause me pain as rock and roll bad boy paul simon once said i am a rock i am an iiiisland
oh goodie put him on speaker phone
excuse me ladies my pants are buzzing north sea how can i kelp you
penny hey it’s penny everybody say hi to penny
wow it sounds like you’re having a good time
isn’t it five thirty in the morning there
is it hey everybody it’s five thirty in the morning
uh okay well we were just calling you because we were missing you
no it’s a drinking game whenever we see an iceberg we take a shot
leonard leonard i cannot believe we were missing that jerk
so what happened how’d it go
it’s fine i thanked them again and let them know we’re not available
so i can drink this without having to give up the goodies
yes it’s all cool although if you wanted to talk to one of them no one would blame you
and why would no one blame me
i don’t know what i’m saying
well it sounds like you’re saying that i could do better than sheldon
boy these drinks are strong hoo mama i’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight
no tell me i want to know what you meant by that
i just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of sheldon
and your husband is extremely howard what’s your point
sorry i have no point that was a stupid thing to say can we please just go back to having a nice time
we could but unfortunately my brain is lesionfree and i remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo
come on i apologize can we please just let it go
your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous
i can’t believe it all this time i’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy and you know what the worst part is
that you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka
no yeah but you know what the secondworst part is he does not miss me at all
allow me to comfort you at least you’ve got your health
really that that’s it that’s comforting
um uh in a hundred years you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter
no come on you’re supposed to say of course he misses you the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain
oh no i don’t think that’s true at all
this is ridiculous why am i upset just because he’s off having a good time
well perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman is that it did i get it right
okay that that’s great you can stop trying to make me feel better now
actually i can’t before leonard left he made me promise that i’d take care of you
plus if i do a good job he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap
well now i miss him even more
well if it’s any consolation i’m sure leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips
i’d like to apologize for being insensitive and for possibly making penguins seem like jerks because 99 of them are standup guys
you know you you and i you and i have a lot in common
oh yes i i too am in the throes of heartbreak okay fine i’ll tell you about it
here is a hot beverage to comfort you it’s in a togo cup make of that what you will
come on it’s still early let’s do something
well i have been toying around with an idea for 4d chess
no come on let’s talk about our lives tell me something about you i don’t know
i own nine pairs of pants
okay that that’s a good start but i was thinking maybe something a little more personal
i see i own nine pairs of underpants
but i don’t want to know how many underpants you own although based on the floor of your bedroom i’d say it’s a thousand
okay look here’s something people do not know about me when i first moved out to la i did a topless scene in a lowbudget horror movie about a killer gorilla ugh after i did it i felt so ashamed thankfully that thing never came out
i’ve seen that yeah serial apeist howard found it online the day we met you
and it was literally the moment you walked out the door but i see the type of personal revelations you’re going for okay here’s one i thought i’d take to the grave
hmm a while back youtube changed its user interface from a starbased rating system to a thumbsup rating system i tell people i’m okay with it but i’m really not
yes whew i feel ten pounds lighter
okay you know what i give up i’m going to bed
here’s something else you don’t know about me you just hurt my feelings
i opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me and you treated it as if it were nothing
i i didn’t think it was a big deal
it is to me that’s the point
sheldon you are right i’m really sorry i should’ve known better
thank you how about a hug
now i know how you felt getting mauled by that sexcrazed gorilla
mmhmm it was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks
maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes
so hypothetically if if we were to have gone with them which one would you have picked
i think i would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut
oh good ’cause i liked the tall thin one he seemed intelligent kind of a loner maybe a little sexually inexperienced like i’d have to teach him a thing or two
not my guy i caught him staring at my rack it’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan fyi it’s another cardigan
your short sexedup guy kind of sounds like howard
your brainy virgin kind of sounds like sheldon
all right dr koothrappali it’s been nice talking to you but i need to go home and relieve my babysitter
yeah i can relate to being a single parent i have a dog
yeah it’s exactly the same thing good night
mrs davis i uh i must confess i came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc but instead i got to connect with you at a human level that’s a much better evening you’re a lovely person
no no no that would be crazy i mean if i were hitting on you you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me
you’re sweet good night dr koothrappali
looks like she accepted your apology
and then some i think we had a moment
oh please you did not have a moment
who died and made you king of moments
okay fine let’s say there was a moment
there wasn’t but but even if there was what are you gonna do about it
i will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed hungry for the pleasure only i can give her
ah i’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape
that is my girlfriend i swear to god
and here’s another interesting weather fact
changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the earth rotates on its axis so bad weather can actually make the day longer
well there must be a hell of a storm somewhere
joke if you must but you’re going to miss these moments with leonard home in a few days this was your last time driving me to the grocery store
you know i will miss this
i’ll tell you what if my apples are mealy we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout heck you can even push the cart please don’t take my looking forward to leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence
that criticism will come later in your report card
yeah i didn’t stay for the detention i’m not gonna read the report card
oh my god you weren’t supposed to be here till sunday
we finished the experiment early so i thought i’d come home and surprise you
oh my gosh why are we whispering
i didn’t tell sheldon so we could have a few days alone
uh sure that’s why i did it
oh i just cannot believe you’re here
penny it’s your lucky day three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo grab your keys
uh stuart i was wondering if you could help me find something
happy to unless it’s hope or a reason to live
oh you make me laugh sad clown anyhoo leonard will be back in a couple days and i need a welcome home gift for him as he’s been at sea perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate
okay well i don’t know how much you want to spend but i do have this pretty cool aquaman statue
aquaman oh this isn’t a gag gift stuart
yeah just as well it’s a pretty rare piece i’d rather just sell it to a real collector
i’m a real collector how rare is it
oh i shouldn’t even have mentioned it how about a batman squirt gun
don’t try and trick me into buying something i don’t want now let’s talk aquaman
what were they thinking putting doctor octopus’s mind in spiderman’s body
well i’ve been quite enjoying that it combines all the superhero fun of spiderman with all the bodyswitching shenanigans of freaky friday both versions original and lohan
i’m sorry i’ve been kind of snippy lately it’s probably this stupid diet i’m on
why are you on a diet
i’ve put on a couple pounds had to buy these pants in the men’s section
well we’ve all seen your mom that butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost
twelve hundred dollars that’s my final offer
all right sheldon you win i’m sure leonard is gonna love this
oh right a present for leonard you better throw in that squirt gun
ooh yeah i don’t know this squirt gun it’s uh it’s pretty rare
and this is me doing the titanic pose on the boat
and oh that’s me getting rescued after i fell in
oh knock on door oh that’s the pizza
and i’m gonna hit the head that’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go peepee
okay here’s uh twentyfive keep the change
oh okay well here’s um thirty something cents and a promise i won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana
oh penny i see you’ve ordered pizza i have chinese food
oh that’s a rather earthy cologne my uncle used to wear that perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before leonard returns
yeah thanks but i kind of feel like eating alone tonight so…
are you sure with your italian pizza and my chinese noodles we could play marco polo i mean of course a reenactment of a meal in the life of marco polo the venetian explorer not marco polo the terrifying water sport
uh yeah it sounds fun but no thanks toilet flushes have a good night
what now do you have company
no no no no you know what the toilet’s been doing that i called the building manager so…
oh i can take a look at it
i’m quite familiar with plumbing not to brag but i spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet
yeah no no no you know what sheldon it’s okay you don’t have to go into the bathroom
that’s curious if there’s no one here why are there two glasses of wine on the table
oh well you know i i’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem
of course ask a silly question
there are takeout containers in the trash can
so that’s my dinner from last night
what’s odd is they’re in the trash can
okay look honey i promise there’s no one’s here i‘ve had a long day i just want to have a quiet dinner by myself
oh very well i’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude oh
have you gotten leonard a welcomehome gift yet
oh great do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun
i made some brownies you want one
you’re kidding right i mean you know i’m trying to lose weight god i thought we were partners in this marriage
we are stop it and for the last time you’re not fat
really tell that to the bathroom scale ’cause one of you is lying
fine forget i asked how was dinner at your mom’s
awful i had to rub her ointment all over her again
‘cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship which reminds me do you think you can get any samples of this from work this was supposed to last her a month but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back
let me see how long have you been putting this on her
i don’t know few weeks why
this is really strong oestrogen cream please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves
like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves
howie the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin that’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass
you’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that
that’s ’cause i’m a woman i’ve had years of practice riding the dragon
fine i’ll wear gloves next time
it’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system
i feel so stupid and fat
it’s okay you still look great to me in fact why don’t we go in the bedroom and i’ll prove it to you
sex really i mean that’s just your solution to everything
oh and here’s a fun thing i worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon planko and janko planko is a spoon with food janko is a spoon without food janko is spelled with a silent ptang sheldon you’re not even listening to the rules of my madeup language
i’m sorry i’m just distracted by something that happened over at penny’s
i fear penny is being unfaithful to leonard
she claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment i have no choice but to assume the worst given leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions
i don’t think penny would cheat on leonard
oh really she and i once had a staring contest she clapped really loud and made me blink it’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity
amy there were chinese food containers in the trash can
no it’s you all right i hear whispering and giggling now i think i hear kissing
yeah like you know what kissing sounds like
there’s kissing in star trek smartypants
let me listen sounds like leonard
please why would leonard come home early and waste his time kissing penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy yeah that’s it i’m catching her in the act unlocks door
sheldon you cannot just barge in here like that
right goes out knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny are you going to answer the door or should i open it and say aha again
i’m sorry sheldon i should’ve told you i was back i just wanted to have a couple days alone with penny
oh no i should apologize uh i never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you
that is not fair i complain about what a burden it is at least once a month
oh no no let’s not sugarcoat this you find me finicky pedantic and annoying
i actually have used those exact words before in that order
well leonard i think it’s high time you and i address the tweepadock in the room
please leave me out of this
fine leonard there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore
come on i said i was sorry
no no you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with penny
come on this is silly hey um i brought you back a little present from my trip huh it’s that sailor cap that you wanted it’s neat huh
you honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir
i don’t i really don’t just try it on oh yeah
excuse me this changes nothing except the halloween costume i’m wearing this year amy you’re going to be olive oyl lay off the doughnuts
no problem ooh you made little sandwiches
yeah that’s cucumber and cream cheese that’s turkey and loganberry and don’t tell my hips but i’m warming up a brie in the oven
okay well i’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen and i need you to be honest with me do my boobs look bigger to you
well it’s kind of hard to tell
come on raj it’s a yes or no question
i’m not sure um wait jump up and down let’s see if they jiggle uh no i i still can’t tell uh oh you know what okay uh give me some of this
do you want my help or not
okay yup see see that that looks like that looks like they could be bigger but you know i bet i bet when i do it mine do the same thing
hmm uh let me see something grabs his boob
hey easy my nipples are sensitive
oh sorry sorry uh okay grabs boob again behind them bernadette walks in i mean yeah maybe
okay let me feel no i am definitely up a cup size
you know but but they’re very firm so you’ve got that going for you
thank you i really needed to hear that today bernadette rolls eyes and walks out ooh brie’s ready
so am i driving you to work or are you still mad at me
i’d like a ride assuming you actually do take me to work
where do you think i would take you
who knows uh you said you’d be home yesterday but you came home three days ago you say you’re taking me to work but for all i know i’ll end up in a deserted amusement park or a cornfield maze or a back alley dog fight you tell me
i’m going to work you can come if you want
okay by the way you have something on your shirt
hurts doesn’t it you know i find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true
i didn’t make it back the ship sank i’m in hell
you say you’re from new jersey but how can i believe you
why would anyone claim to be from new jersey if they weren’t
all right i’ll give you that one
hey i said i was sorry what else do you want from me
i want you to admit that what you did was wrong
fine what i did was wrong
i wish i could believe you
you know what i’m not driving you to work because you’re incredibly annoying
you say one thing and do the other so then you are driving me and you find me a delight
hello so i guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers
oh hey what are you doing here so early
he’s still mad at leonard huh
well he’s mad at you too he says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray
i don’t know what succubus is but it has suck in it so that can’t be good
thought i heard you out here
you don’t get a hey you get a hmm
come on don’t be like that we had so much fun together the last couple of months
you’re right which makes your betrayal all the more devastating
i let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card you have any idea the kind of coupons i’m going to get in the mail now
sheldon your fight’s with leonard penny’s got nothing to do…
careful amy the friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy
yes you’re either with me or against me
you want to take the bus to work
fyi i had a doughnut for breakfast you jerk
so now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched but the numbers look pretty promising
that’s so great if you guys prove the existence of unruh radiation… hey hey hey hey my eyes are up here
you know what you’re a crazy person
a crazy person with a long memory and if all goes according to plan a robot army
or a mutant army it depends on how my kickstarter goes
i said stop it now listen to me you two aren’t just friends you’re best friends and that’s a beautiful thing i mean leonard you know why he’s so mad at you it’s ’cause he missed you yeah and as his friend you should be happy he has love in his life as i do this man held my breast the other day and i love him for it
so can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together
uh it wasn’t anything weird it was just to see how big they were
and then leonard took me to the barber and the dentist and then to cap off the perfect day the los angeles bureau of weights and measures
i thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show turns out it was the weights
i’m so glad you guys are friends again
and i’m glad you and i are friends again too
which reminds me this came in the mail and i want you to have it
think of me when you apply it
uh can i just say i’ve missed all of us hanging out together
um since when can koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer
oh that happened right after you left
can’t believe we forgot to tell him
think of sheldon when you apply it
so couldn’t help but notice none of you rsvp’d to my murder mystery dinner party
oh yeah we were meaning to do that
no you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came so if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference it was all of you
i don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery we all knew what we were doing
maybe we can do it next week
whoa whoa we’re not that sorry
don’t worry i can take a hint no more murder mystery parties
because i’ve got something even better planned
just hear me out i’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at mit
oh i loved those i did them every year there
we did them at princeton too
oh that’s cute like it’s a real college
that’s amusing i was going to say that about mit but it works for princeton too
scavenger hunts at harvard were really tough i always got stuck on the first challenge trying to find someone to be on a team with me i guess that story’s more sad than funny
i love scavenger hunts my friends and i had them all the time
oh these are a little different there’s a tradition at elite universities…
a tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge science
oh in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer
i’m sorry are we really doing this or are we tricking koothrappali again like with the dinner party
oh everything i could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt
you really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley
well if he does do you know how filthy those rental balls are they might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams
okay everybody who’s ready for a scavenger hunt pumping disco music somewhere in the city of pasadena i’ve hidden a golden coin you will be faced with a total of ten puzzles each p… cough each each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next the last of which will lead you to the coin the first team that finds it wins
yes to be fair do people who went to princeton get a head start
no oh it actually is if you get the joke it’s based on the premise that princeton isn’t a very good school
oh see now he gets it
okay guys go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two
couples sounds great or we could mix things up maybe pick names out of a hat whatever
whoa whoa whoa why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me
i just said couples sound great
mmhmm yeah you don’t think i’m smart enough you think i’m gonna be a liability even though i totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence yeah
all right let’s let’s do couples i want to
no no let’s mix things up i choose sheldon and we’re gonna kick your ass
really the only time i’m ever picked first for a team and i’m stuck with the liability
stop that penny is not a liability
thank you do you want to be on my team
maybe we pick names out of a hat
all right hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us would you stop pouting so you picked my name get over it
yes and do you know what the odds are i’d pick your name
it’s not hard one in five now you know why i’m pouting
all right teams get ready to open your first puzzle go do you see what i did the first puzzle is a puzzle oh my god how adorable is that i wish i had a friend like me
what are you doing you have to start with the edges
well there’s no right way sheldon i already found a few pieces that fit
yeah well take them apart and start with the edges and stop wasting time
wow you’re really good at puzzles
i did them all the time as a kid as my mom used to say when you’re doing a puzzle it’s like having a thousand friends she was full of fun lies like that
if it makes you feel any better my mom’s just full of pound cake
i’m sorry you got stuck with me i bet you wanted to be with bernadette
have you ever played a game with bernadette
have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine
faster faster faster do you not know that word it means more fast
hey you’ll know when i’m yelling at you
ooh ooh it’s the comic book store all right come on that’s where we have to go
but we haven’t finished the puzzle
but it it doesn’t matter we know the answer come on
you think you know the answer but it could be a trick what if when the puzzle’s complete there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store
okay it’s not gonna say that
well i hope you’re wrong i really want to go to the train store
it’s the comic book store let’s go
come on numb nuts it’s the comic book store
it’s the comic book store it’s the comic book store it’s the comic book store
do you think penny’s mad at me
because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it i’m sure she finds it charming
no because i didn’t want her on my team
i’m starting to think she dodged a bullet the slowest bullet in the world
geez i never realized you were so competitive
yeah i know its it’s probably because i grew up with five brothers and sisters so i had to fight for every… oh my god you did not just slow down for a bird you know they fly right
i think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together
huh i guess you’re right wonder why that is
well off the top of my head i’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with plus when we first met penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you
yeah you know i bet you and i have more in common than we think
i don’t know tell me some things you like
uh let’s see i like harps little house on the prairie medieval poetry medieval literature…
great sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car he doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member
beatles boring eminem scary weird al how old are you neil diamond
sweet caroline bumbada good times never seemed so good so good so good so good i’ve been inclined…
oh hey thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt
oh my pleasure always happy to help out with fun things that i wasn’t invited to be a part of
oh congratulations you’re the first team to arrive
yes it’s not a ruse to make fun of me it’s a real game and i’m winning it
your next puzzle is a riddle and who better to give it to you than the riddler
go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go how am i faster than you i’m in heels and i stopped to take a phone call
riddle me this arrah arrah and gather round the work of this hero is legionbound he multiplies n by the number of he and in this room the thing you’ll see
yeah so when you guys plan fun activities does my name even come up or…
i invited you to my murder mystery party
ugh we’re the last ones here hurry up
it is a marathon not a sprint
not with a bowling ball on their back
hey penny i just wanted to say good luck and i hope there’s no hard feelings
hey romeo repair your relationship on your own time
relax it’s a hard puzzle it’s gonna take a while to solve
hey princeton look at that team community college night school is in the lead
i thought we were the lightning sharks
hey you know what this could mean whispers
oh oh that’s good then this would be whispers back
i knew it we’re gonna lose
wait i got it i got it
you’re really mean you know that
so no one’s gonna buy anything
aha okay let’s see to continue on your quest leave no stone unturned ooh
the next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks
oh okay sheldon i i’ve got to ask how did you figure out that it was the geology lab
oh simple the ‘arrah ‘arrah in the riddle mean jan arrah a member of the legion of superheroes known as element lad and then the word he it wasn’t the masculine pronoun but rather h e the abbreviation for helium see where i’m going with this
nice try now element lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements helium has an atomic number of two if you multiply that by the atomic number of n nitrogen you get 14 which is the atomic number of i’m just funnin’ you silicon and that is the most common element in the earth’s surface so that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab
wow i can drink a beer underwater
and i’m sure your parents are proud now finally the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to fantastic four member the thing who’s made entirely of…
those are map coordinates got ’em let’s go
well wait don’t you want to know how i figured it out
no one likes a knowitall penny
on the boats and on the planes
um i’m okay with you driving my car i’m not okay with you flying my car
don’t sweat it my dad’s a cop he can fix things
your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron
who cares focus on the game
this stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place i’m telling her i’m quitting
no quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship
because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are
what does she think i am
how do i put this she’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part or a cat or a willow
i can’t believe she would say that about me
if you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse unless you got some in yours big willow
they’re coming to america they’re coming to america
okay oh it’s a bowling alley
yes yes my brain is better than everybody’s
and i’ll tell you some lies
call me a lady part we’ll see about that
hurry sheldon and penny were right behind us in the bowling alley
great climb back up come on
yeah penny might be onto something
there’s a neil diamond concert next month
three bags no one’s opened ’em we’re the first ones here
because you’ve been training for this your whole life you live in a pile of dirty laundry
they’re here first this is because you made me slow down for that blind guy
okay the clue must be in the bag
the clue must be in the bag
it’s just a bunch of pants
it’s just a bunch of pants
you know i’m surprised you want to copy my answers since i’m not even smart enough to be on your team
well why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a i can’t even say it in front of sheldon
you know exactly what i’m talking about
no she doesn’t i just made that up
because you were about to quit like a big sheldon cover your ears
i’m not a child i know the word ninny
yeah well you should have quit ’cause i’m still gonna beat your ass
wish i had a man like her on my team
hey i am every bit as much of a man as penny now let’s do this
wait it’s not all pants there’s one shirt
no no that’s not mine it has a big spot on it
but wait so does this one
sheldon’s spot the coin is in your spot
be there in a minute i just have to presoak these
well where the hell’s the coin
oh yes leonard yes it was
yes exactly where is the coin why don’t you look in your pockets i slipped them in there earlier today
don’t you see when we’re all having fun together we’re already winners oh look see even i’m a winner
that is the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard
well i thought… come on i didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game and some of those puzzles were really hard and i didn’t know who was gonna get penny
okay okay thatthat came out wrong but you have to admit you all had a wonderful time
i just wanted to do something beautiful
hey she got the way to move me cherry
she got the way to groove me
she got the way to move me honey
she got the way to groove me she got the way to move me
she got the way to groove me yeah
i enjoyed it when you told me i was going to be losing my virginity i didn’t think you meant showing me raiders of the lost ark for the first time
my apologies i chose my words poorly i should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch anyway thank you for watching it it’s one of my alltime favourites
it was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem
story problem you oh amy what a dewyeyed mooncalf you are raiders of the lost ark is the love child of steven spielberg and george lucas two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation i’ve watched it 36 times except for the snake scene and the facemelting scene which i can only watch when it’s still light out but i defy you to find a story problem here’s my jaw drop it
all right indiana jones plays no role in the outcome of the story if he weren’t in the film it would turn out exactly the same
oh i see your confusion you don’t understand indiana jones was the one in the hat with the whip
no i do and if he weren’t in the movie the nazis would have still found the ark taken it to the island opened it up and all died just like they did let me close that for ya
hi i thought you went to the comic book store on wednesdays
yeah but sheldon and amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward they have each other for that so how was school
oh good check it out the disappointing child by beverly hofstadter
yeah it’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class
oh come on not that book it it’s got like every horrible story from my childhood in it
oh come on why how bad could it be
there there’s chapters about potty training and bedwetting and masturbation basically if something came out of me she wrote about it you know what do whatever you want just don’t talk to me about it
not even the chapter on the breastfeeding crisis
it was not a crisis apparently i favoured the left one she got a little lopsided
oh my god you still go left
which celebrity would you say i look like the most
stuart and i are putting dating profiles online and it’s one of the questions and thank you i’d kill for that woman’s bone structure
why are you reading pride and prejudice
i’ll tell you why amy ruined raiders of the lost ark for me so now i’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that
wait how can how can anyone ruin raiders it’s perfect
yeah except for the fact that indiana jones is completely irrelevant to the story with or without him the nazis find the ark open it and die
hey wait a minute no the nazis were digging in the wrong place the only reason they got the ark was because indy found it first
actually they were only digging in the wrong place because indy had the medallion without him they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place
okay i know you don’t want to talk about it but can i just ask you one question about your mom’s book
i just want to know why a fiveyearold boy puts on his mom’s makeup and wears balloon boobies
they weren’t boobies they were muscles and the makeup was green i was pretending to be the hulk
that was to keep my muscles from sagging can we please stop talking about this
okay okay but you know as a student of psychology who got a checkplus on her first homework assignment i think sometimes it’s good to open up about these things
okay fine do you want to know why i dressed like the hulk because i was always mad at my mom and i wanted to smash my way out of that house
well why were you so angry
gee i don’t know maybe it’s because i was always the subject of her little experiments did you get to the chapter where she staged the easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long i’d keep looking the answer by the way june
sweetie i’m so sorry i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better
i do too but there’s not
really are you sure about that
of course who am i to argue with a checkplus student just warning you i’m gonna go right don’t make a big deal out of it
well when someone looks at your dating profile the first thing they see is your picture i just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river all right here we go and smile okay uhuh that one’s in the bank how about this turn away and then turn back into it but when you do imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet
okay uh let’s try it again uh but this time pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you
i don’t think i can give you that
come on one more time yeah it’s it’s a little blurry but i think that works in your favour do you want a beer
sure hey have you finished writing your profile yet
almost oh what did you put as the oneword description of yourself
i put unobjectionable but now that i hear it out loud it just seems like i’m being cocky what did you put for your best feature
my parents’ money uh what did you put for your best feature
come on dude you’re being too hard on yourself you’ve got a lot of good stuff going on
well okay you’re a you’re a talented artist you own your own business
neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman
okay well can we imply that you’re wellendowed
i do have one oddly long testicle
okay now you’re talking like a winner
oh it turns out amy’s beloved pride and prejudice is a flawless masterpiece he’s got too much pride she’s got too much prejudice it just works
so you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages
amy has a fondness for the comic strip marmaduke
and i think i’ve got it consider a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined he causes nothing but problems why do they keep him
maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be
of course you know why couldn’t she just like ziggy yeah that thing’s riddled with plot holes
ooh i think she’s a fan of garfield as well oh darn it now so am i
i’ll see you later i gotta go watch a stupid football game with penny
wait hang on you’ve spent time with amy can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed
yep hey and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys
some sports bar it’s like they never even heard of quidditch do we really have to go
oh come on every time we’re about to hang out with my friends you don’t want to it’s like it’s too loud or the bathroom’s too dirty or they put a chicken wing in my ear i mean…
well you’re you’re right let’s just go
hey what’s going on with you
all right hang on is this still about your mom’s book
no not everything is about my mom
‘cause if you’re still upset about that we don’t have to go
except this is totally about my mom
i’m so sorry i never should have read that book you know what you want to just get dinner and watch the game here
or you know we could get takeout and watch the bluray extended version of the hobbit movie with commentary track on account of how sad i am about my mom
hi all right sweetie you hang in there today
i’ll try but i might be sad again tonight
leave it alone that’s my girlfriend
who just had sex with me at work
well whenever i talk about how awful my mom was penny will do anything to make me feel better
look i mean i’m not proud of it but it does work i got her to watch a sixpart documentary on monty python even i was bored i just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end
you sound kind of proud of it
well the last time you made an unscheduled videochat there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey
april 13 a dark night indeed
so what can i do for you
i’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening
yes you were kind enough to watch raiders of the lost ark with me so i’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series little house on the prairie
that sounds lovely why are you rubbing your hands together
um i’m putting on lotion are you in or not
excellent then i shall see you tomorrow good night dr fowler
good night indeed what a rube why would i put on lotion when i have such soft hands
you were really quiet during dinner is everything okay
yeah i guess i was just thinking about my mom and how sad my childhood was
yeah i bet it sucked i’m gonna take a bath you do the dishes
how about i take a bath with you and see what happens
here’s what’s gonna happen i’m gonna take a bath and you’re gonna do the dishes
aw poor howie we good i’m gonna take a bath
god what is going on with you
and i’m not buying it try again
i’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how
i’m copying leonard when he does this to penny they have sex and watch monty python
i know it was dumb i shouldn’t have done it and it’s making me feel sad so sad you know why don’t you take a bath i’ll do the dishes
that’s it our dating profiles are live on the internet
attention all shoppers my business is open for business
that’s right ladies for all you know i’m confident and fun to be around
oh cool it tells you when someone’s reading your profile jenny309 i hope that’s not her weight
if it is i’ll take her ooh i got one too the ladies are coming to us oh man if i’d started this years ago i’d be divorced two or three times by now
what another one you know it it’s weird when they’re reading your profile does it does it make you feel exposed like they see you naked
well they’re not running away screaming so no
i love little house it made me want to live on a farm so much i tried to milk my cat that tangy bowl of cheerios was not worth the stitches
well you sit back relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory you see that cabin there i read they were illegally squatting on indian land yeah personally i think what we did to the native americans was wrong but this is your favourite show not mine oh look at little laura ingalls eating that peanut butter sandwich peanut butter huh that’s strange since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s if i knew this show was about time travel i would have watched it much sooner
you’re trying to get back at me for what i said about raiders of the lost ark
that’s silly almost as silly as dr baker having a telephone since telephones only existed in large cities at that time this is more like little house on the preposterous
sheldon we’re in a relationship when you get angry just tell me you don’t need to seek revenge
are you sure every time my dad stayed out all night my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco
well that’s not how we’re going to do it
fine i’m mad at you not only did you ruin raiders for me you may have ruined the whole franchise except for the fourth one which was bad before you got your mitts on it
i shouldn’t have said it i’m sorry
yes but not as good as i’m going to when i tell you that your precious garfield has no reason to hate mondays he’s a cat he doesn’t have a job
hey i was just… what is happening
oh just a little treat i know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately
oh oh i have so bad
and i wanted to make you feel better so i planned something very special for you
uhhuh i can already feel it working
i understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend
bernadette told me everything now you don’t get the left or the right
let’s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life
when you were six years old you walked in on me and your father naked i was swatting his bottom with your brand new ping pong paddle
how did that make you feel
penny come back i’m sad for real now
in the last two hours 162 women have read our profiles how many of them have sent us messages
dude this is this is brutal
i don’t think i’ve ever felt so rejected and i had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound
this is the worst if we’re gonna get shot down we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school
and make them look us in the eye
yeah anything is better than this
i was wrong this is worse
wait wait if it wasn’t for indiana jones the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse
that’s true he collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing
although technically indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied he couldn’t even get that done
awkward silence sheldon on his phone no touching somebody’s having date night
it’s actually steamier than it looks sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in renaissance paintings
oh no i got bored with that i’m just browsing cuticle scissors on amazon
how do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table
if you do that i’ll scream
sheldon i have some exciting news to tell you
that makes two of us my new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days come on one
i’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months isn’t that great we could have lunch together we could carpool
you know riding with leonard has gotten a little tedious lately the only car game he ever wants to play is the quiet game and he’s terrible at it i always win
well this project would have us working in close proximity to one another and there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats
my father used to say that all the time that and um who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here but what does that have to do with you working at the university
sheldon don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace
huh yeah i always took it literally that’s why i have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant hmm
i’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together
not as relieved as i’m about to be it’s a brave new world little lady
are you crazy you don’t want your girlfriend at work with you hell clam
i think it could be romantic you know my parents met at his place of work
i know what started as a pap smear turned into a date which turned into her working there which turned into marriage which then turned into hatred which continues to this day twoeyed cyclops
would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea
no no i think it’ll be great maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes giant baby
i’m just saying i’d never want to work with bernadette can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work too
hold on we do that all the time you and i work together and play together
yeah i know and it drove me into the arms of another woman bipolar bear
well i appreciate your concern but i won’t be seeing any more of amy than i already do i assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota
please let me be there when you tell her that
why so you can see the look on amy’s face when she hears my topnotch idea
please oh please just let me be there
so amy what are you gonna be working on at caltech
i’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys
if they’re anything like humans the answer’s yes
wait you’ve you’ve done this experiment on humans
you mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose no that would be unethical
you know not a lot of people know this but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman mary bernheim that’s right my phone is just as smart as you guys
knock knock knock amy bernadette penny knock knock knock amy bernadette penny knock knock knock amy bernadette penny
he’s never gonna stop doing that is he
i don’t mind i’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday
hi um i’ve reconsidered uh you can’t work where i work enjoy the rest of your evening
sheldon i already signed the contract i cashed a cheque
mmm you are not going to come out of this looking good
sheldon i don’t understand i thought you said you were fine with it
well i was but that was before howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other
now don’t be insulted he just thinks too much of you would be mindnumbingly tedious
excuse me i need to have a chat with my husband
yeah well now well keep it short from what i gather brevity is your friend so are we good here
no we’re not good here i am working on this project
yeah and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do
last week you told leonard he couldn’t wear his wookie jacket out in public
that’s different i’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear
sheldon you don’t have to worry about me bothering you i’ll be in a different building and we don’t even have to have lunch together
yes before all things i’m a scientist i’m just there to do my work and with a little luck scare the living crap out of some monkeys
hmm you sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself
well then you have my permission
i didn’t ask for your permission
no no listen to me sheldon misunderstood what i meant was if we worked together there’d be too much of me for you not the other way around
howard if you’re going to lie to your wife don’t start the sentence with sheldon misunderstood that’s a dead giveaway
okay fine i did say that and i think it’s true i think if we worked together and lived together we’d get sick of each other
yeah but to be fair he only said the part about him getting sick of you
for the love of god why
what exactly do you think you’d get sick of
his only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one
is it my voice am i too bossy what
that’s the wrong arm for a heart attack doofus
my point is i’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long
like looking me in the eye and lying to me
oh well come on where am i supposed to look when i lie to you
find somewhere else to sleep tonight
if it makes you feel any better amy and i are fine i mean really good
so boys how was the pyjama party you guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes
it wasn’t a pyjama party it was just a couple of bros hanging out giggling eating cookie dough and watching princess bride
i mean you know sheldon none of this would’ve happened if i hadn’t tried to help you
uh it also wouldn’t have happened if in the early universe hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common this is fun your turn
that was kind of icy you two okay
oh we’re fine as howard advised she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries
smart take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding raj’s hair
yeah you make a good point it would appear i was worried for nothing look at her desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table don’t worry little moth the flame will come to you
oh uh on the off chance that bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize how do you feel about mexican food for dinner tonight
i don’t know sounds kind of heavy
that’s ’cause you always fill up on chips
and this is dr gunderson from stockholm
ah sweden yeah home of my favourite muppet and uh second favourite meatball okay the nordic reputation for lack of humour is wellfounded boy is his name gunderson or nofunderson
where are we going with this dr cooper
oh please i’m your boyfriend you call me sheldon that’s right i am in a boygirl relationship with this cute little lump of wool
it’s a physical relationship too handholding hugging even on hot days ow okay here’s a new one apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table how do you like it when i do it to you not so much huh
test subject d7 aka betsy fear response study image number one frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes no visible reaction image number two sousaphone still no reaction okay let’s kick things up a notch image number three crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys okay now we’re talking
well i’m done with work so… ugh
oh sorry sorry sorry sorry uh better
oh baguettes yes i like baguettes what exactly are you doing
determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli
so goofing off as i was saying i’m done with work and leonard’s not so good news you get to take me home play your cards right i’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night
i can’t leave now sheldon i’m very busy besides why would i want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria image number four boa constrictor
what on earth are you talking about my behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful maybe your friend gunderson needs to head over to ikea and assemble a sense of humour
you embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here image number five kitten in a teacup
you know what i don’t have time for this find another way home
i’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me
couple things actually your tone of voice your body language…
image number six woman giving birth
it’s nine o’clock where you been
oh i had to take the bus home fell asleep and missed my stop
did you know that los angeles has a little sri lanka
well i do now they’re a lovely people although terrifying when you wake up facetoface with them if you’re hungry i brought home some mutton and coconut milk
why’d you get that you hate lamb
i was asking for directions apparently there was a communication problem
i thought amy was gonna drive you home
yeah i thought so too but she’s acting very strangely i was discussing it with a sri lankan fellow on the bus and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brotherinlaw’s witch doctor practice
okay sheldon what happened between you and amy
well can you believe she said i embarrassed her
but you didn’t even hear the details
sheldon i’ve known you a long time and i’m going to tell you this with all the love i can possibly muster amy’s right you’re wrong
but now but in my defence…
you’re not listening to my side of it
okay fine sheldon what is your side
nope got to go with amy on this one
you got the tropical fruit kind
no if i buy those i just go through them like candy
tell me about it one time i swear i pooped out a stick of chalk knock on door i’ll get it
yeah well i didn’t handle it so great either
it’s just sometimes i feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me
it’s not you spend all day together at work and then you all hang out at night playing games going to the comic book store last week you two got a couples massage so when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me it really hurt my feelings
oh wow yeah no i get that i’m so sorry starting tomorrow i am turning over a new leaf time with you is my number one priority
well we’re real close to finishing off the new batman game
it is awesome uh you should probably go after her
thanks for getting me in trouble
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
sheldon what are you doing here so late
i couldn’t sleep because i kept thinking about what happened earlier between us also i had one heck of a bus nap oh speaking of which do you want some mutton and coconut milk
well i cannot give this stuff away
amy this isn’t easy to say all relationships are difficult but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions and frankly who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo
i wasn’t speaking about me i mean honestly there’s no telling what will set you off you know introducing myself as your boyfriend giving you the opportunity to drive me home breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour the funniest kind of humour
my point is we’re a couple and i like you for who you are quirks and all
well i should hope so i don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense not even a goodbye you see that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird poor kid she just doesn’t see it
i’m not apologizing to howard he can come beg me on his knees
sheldon too if i see him at work i’m just going to ignore him
all right don’t worry i talked to leonard he is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight
do you know what he’s doing
could be anything last time he was like this he figured out electron transport in graphene the time before that he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one still can’t believe i didn’t make the cut
uh sheldon you want to take a break your food’s ready
no no what are you doing he’s both happy and quiet it’s like seeing a unicorn and bigfoot at the same time
sorry we’re so late bernadette got stuck at work
great news a raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans
in the pharmaceutical business we have a saying mo’ infections mo’ money
wait maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first
oh calm down if i had it i’d be dead already
can’t listen zone also don’t care
next week is the anniversary of my first date with bernadette
i want to do something special and i was hoping you guys could be a part of it
aw what horrible thing are you trying to make up for
just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing i do next
look she’s gonna be back any second so here’s the deal i’m writing a song and i was hoping we could all play it for her together
when did we get to the cheesecake factory
it’s really sweet what howard wants to do for bernadette
yeah hey how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date
well for starters you’ve broken up with me so many times which first date are we talking about
ooh somebody call the burn ward and back to the zone
and besides i do romantic things for you all the time can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me
oh i know what about that bedandbreakfast
well i took you there all you did was…
i know what i did i bet they had to throw out that rocking chair you know i can be romantic if i want to
it’s fine and also not true
okay just you wait and see i’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off
he’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof
sheldon i know you’re in the zone but do you want some tea all right i can’t believe i’m gonna say this but you haven’t spoken in hours and i’m starting to get worried please say something
leonard prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius
look at it i feel like my mind just made a baby and it’s beautiful it’s not like human babies which are loud and covered in goop
holy crap sheldon did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable superheavy element
did i well that can’t be right no one’s ever done that before except me because i just did it sheldon and his brain yeah sheldon and his brain yeah sheldon and his brain yeah sheldon and his brain yeah sheldon and his brain…
so i’m almost done writing the song for bernadette are you cool playing the cello
if by cool you mean willing to yes if by cool you mean cool clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello
great will you play the ukulele
of course i’d be happy to shred it on my ax
or you could just play your tiny ridiculous guitar
fine i will melt her heart and her face
gentlemen uh no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough now if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria please refrain i don’t care for heights motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks
yeah i read your paper online that technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired
oh well thank you believe it or not i just learned a chinese research team at the hubei institute for nuclear physics ran a test on a cyclotron and the results were extremely promising
yeah i know they called it the greatest thing since the communist party although i’m pretty sure that the communist party made them say that i like china see they know how to keep people in line
oh more testing more success more fame yeah but don’t worry i will remain the same downtoearth humble joe i’ve always been
now give me that cookie i discovered an element
thank you so much for coming
you called the right person i believe i have the perfect romantic evening for you to give leonard
okay good ’cause i’ve been really struggling with this
as i’m sure you’re aware the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…
pants but leonard says sex doesn’t count
oh you poor thing you have one arrow in your quiver and you just can’t use it fortunately another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach
i don’t know if i want to cook for him he’s kind of a picky eater i mean it’s too salty it’s too dry it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time okay come on what else would sweep you off your feet
well i’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing the sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric but boy oh boy does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition
okay that’s just the plot for dirty dancing what else would you love other than being lifted over patrick swayze’s head
oh oh uh you could uh stand outside his window with a boom box in the air
look i’m a lonely guy i watch a lot of movies look penny if you truly want to be romantic it needs to come from you
i get that but why is this so hard
well you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you
yeah i’m trying to be sad about that i can’t
let’s see what’s next okay here this is the magic marker i was using when i made the discovery
i don’t think the smithsonian’s gonna want your marker
and that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort ooh guess who’s getting an article written about him in physics today i’ll give you a hint you measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday
sheldon i’m so proud of you
well you should be my discovery is spreading like wildfire unlike my mole which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean
this is the very copy of the handbook of chemistry and physics in which i looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
this table it’s in square centimetres i read it as square metres you know what that means
that americans can’t handle the metric system
amy i was off by a factor of 10000
but the chinese team found the element
yeah well they shouldn’t have my calculations were wrong there must be some resonance between the elements i didn’t know about
sheldon cooper does not get lucky
you and me both brother it doesn’t matter the element was found because of you and that’s groundbreaking
what matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder i’m not a genius i’m a fraud
you know sheldon in neuroscience we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else
oh great now i’m worse than a fraud i’m practically a biologist
there’s nothing happy about it i’m being given credit that i don’t deserve
oh people get things they don’t deserve all the time look at me with you
no leonard this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life every science classroom every periodic table every textbook this mistake will be staring back at me like that time you let koothrappali wax your eyebrows i’ve got to find a way to stop this thing
buddy i don’t think you can i mean once it’s out there it’s out there this thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape
you know frankly i’d prefer a sex tape
you don’t know what a sex tape is do you
make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and i don’t want to blow the surprise
got it now uh i have a question about the song i was thinking at some point i could bust out a little rap
come on come on you haven’t even heard it yet leonard give me a beat
no i want this to be romantic
it will be i don’t call anyone a ho and the only time i use the phrase my bitch i’m referring to you
and no woos oh not you dr woo you’re fine i want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me my socalled breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius it was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake so please refrain from praising me for it in the future
wait i don’t understand they didn’t find the element
oh no they found the element more applause no no stop it i don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people how do i make them stop loving me
invite them to live with us
boy bernadette is gonna love this
yeah it must be nice to have someone do something so romantic
okay you know what’s not romantic rubbing it in someone’s face
actually it can be but i told you sex doesn’t count
i’m getting worried about bernadette i’m gonna call and check on her
the national science foundation wants to give me a substantial grant
i know when will this nightmare end
hey i get that you feel bad about all the attention but still what you did is amazing we’re really proud of you
sheldon i’ve been thinking about it and you’re right you don’t deserve any credit all you did was misread some numbers on a table a very easy table too honestly i’m embarrassed for you
that’s the most romantic thing i’ve ever heard
damn it everyone’s better at this than me
congratulations dr fowler you just made the fort
guys there was an accident at bernie’s lab
oh my god is she okay
yeah but she’s at the hospital in quarantine
i hate to pile on the bad news but i just got a raise
oh my god bernie what happened
well let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge make two trips
yeah it’s just a precaution if there was a problem i’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now sorry i messed up our date
oh don’t worry about it i brought the date here guys come on in
well tonight is the anniversary of our first date and i wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you
she might be contagious don’t you think i’m having a rough enough day
if i didn’t have you life would be blue i’d be dr who without the tardis
is it me or does she not look so good
a candle without a wick a watson without a crick i’d be one of my outfits without a dickie i’d be cheese without the mac jobs without the wozniak i’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack i’d be an atom without a bomb a dot without the com and i’d probably still live with my mom
and he’d probably still live with his mom
ever since i met you you turned my world around you supported all my dreams and all my hopes you’re like uranium235 and i’m uranium238 almost inseparable isotopes i couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that i met you bernadette
if i didn’t have you life would be dreary i’d be string theory without any string i’d be binary code without a one a cathode ray tube without an electron gun i’d be firefly buffy and avengers without joss whedon i’d speak a lot more klingon heghlu’meh qaq jajvam
and he’d definitely still live with his mom
ever since i met you you turned my world around you’re my best friend and my lover we’re like changing electric and magnetic fields you can’t have one without the other i couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that i met you bernadette
oh we couldn’t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you bernadette
howie that was amazing look i’m shaking
she’s sick i knew it bye
i have to say this is the best top ramen you’ve ever made
i discovered a secret ingredient the flavour packet that sucker is well named all right lover boy get ready ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way
stop it you’re gonna make me cry all right you seem pretty confident
oh i am maybe if you follow this trail you’ll see why
yes the most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers
you made the bed you really are pulling out all the stops
okay i gave this a lot of thought and i finally found something to show you how much i love you
it’s a first edition of hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy i remember it was your favourite book growing up
this is great it thank you it’s so much
no something’s going on what’s wrong with it i remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition
it’s true i did i did say that when we were at the used bookstore together and i saw the first edition and i bought it
oh my god i am the worst
no no it’s okay it’s really thoughtful
no it’s not i mean what’s thoughtful is everything you do here you know what look at this look here’s the the plane ticket you bought me when i was too poor to go home for the holidays and the rose you left on my windshield just because here’s the the thankyou letter you wrote me after the first time i slept with you all 11 pages of it
i can’t believe you saved all this stuff
of course i did it’s you
oh yeah just the first one i didn’t save them all
i can’t believe i read this table wrong i blame you
you distract me i’ve been distracted since the moment i met you
well you should be because all i can think about is how much i want to kiss you and not just on the cheek but on the mouth like mommies and daddies do
amy amy did you hear what i said
i’ve never seen him this happy before
that’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day
look a new topical antihistamine with lidocaine wow i can’t wait until i get a rash
oh gasx has a new ultra strength i guess they really do read their mail
look at him just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago let’s go say hello
oh maybe we shouldn’t bother him
i’m not going to bother him i’m going to talk to him
arthur arthur it’s me sheldon cooper you may not remember because of your advanced age
this is my girlfriend amy amy this is television legend arthur jeffries his science show inspired millions of children
hold hold hold on you you have a girlfriend
yes and i’ve heard so much about you hey look we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes i can’t believe i dress like a celebrity
oh okay i get it now
dr jeffries hello again leonard hofstadter
oh oh right i remember your your girlfriend is is she is she here
so what prescription are you getting filled
no wait i want to guess don’t tell me
i wasn’t going to tell you
no no no i’m really good at this all right give me a hint does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything
well given my age that’s more than just a lucky guess
hey sheldon let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine you love that
but i’m hanging out with my friend and we’re having fun look how happy he is
bernie’s having a girls’ night on friday at our place you want to do something
there’s a new sports bar over on colorado ave…
you know they’re making jewellery right
you think they came up with that they were going to drink beer and play darts
excuse me i happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity
hey i got an email from professor proton
he’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes and wants to know if i’d take a look at it
that’s strange that he would come to you for that and not me oh i got two emails from him do you have leonard’s email address and never mind i found it i can’t believe he picked you over me
you don’t want to read a paper by some old hasbeen who hasn’t done any real science in decades
yeah it’s nothing to cry about
and to think i idolized that man and why at the end of the day he’s just another hollywood phony
is it really worth getting upset about
yeah they say don’t meet your heroes don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity because if you do you’ll see them as they really are degenerate carnival folk
come on he’s a retired kids show host
that’s even worse using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him pervert
have you ever thought about why arthur didn’t want you to read his paper
yes i have and my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills
maybe he found you um a bit much
that’s kind of a stretch look when it comes to social skills i’ve mastered the big three there’s the coy smile there’s the friendly chuckle there’s the vocalization of sympathy aw that last one’s tricky i’m still working on it
from what i saw the other day i could understand why he and some people might find you…
no go ahead say it i know what it is i’ve heard it my whole life the word’s annoying go ahead say it say it say i’m annoying
oh it won’t hurt my feelings go ahead amy say i’m annoying i’m annoying i’m annoying i’m annoying yeah now uh now where are you going look you know you want to say it say it say i’m annoying go ahead say it say it say it amy say it well she can’t stand it when i’m right
this is fun i’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications i’m allergic to
penny how’s it going over there
good i’m just having little trouble with the glue
how do you not know how to use glue did you ditch preschool
yeah but only because i was dating a second grader
okay let me have it let’s hear all the raj is a girl jokes
nope bernadette told me it isn’t nice and i’m not allowed
so i won’t be making fun of you or the things you like or the fact that you just want to have fuun
howie stop come on look at what i’m making
yeah i’m just making a mess
you know instead of beads and glue you guys can use my soldering iron you’d be able to make much cooler stuff
oh i think we’re doing just fine thank you
actually i’d kind of like to try that
knock knock knock arthur knock knock knock arthur knock knock knock arthur door knocker that’s tv money
sheldon what are you doing here
i’m sorry did i wake you
of course you woke me it’s seven thirty
well i would have been here sooner but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of hollywood stars
it’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that i may have been annoying to you
anyway i wanted to apologize i am truly sorry
all right apology accepted have a nice night
no no now that we’ve cleared the air i wanted to discuss another matter with you
sheldon in a couple hours i have to get up pee and then wander around the house
well then i’ll make this quick um i want to talk about the paper you sent leonard now i know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it but now that you and i are friends again i am at your disposal and um frankly lending my name and reputation to it will help because a lot of people think that you’re a washedup hasbeen or dead
so uh what do you say
you know if it’s all the same with you i i think i’ll i’ll stick with leonard
it’s because i’m annoying right i know it is say it say it say i’m annoying
say it arthur say it say i’m annoying say it say it i’m annoying say it
if you would have told me when i was a kid that someday i would be doing science next to professor proton i would not have believed you
if someone had told me that people would still call me professor proton when i was 83 years old i never would have quit smoking
i’m sorry dr jeffries i’m just excited this nano vacuum tube idea of yours is it’s really interesting
hello leonard oh hello arthur what an odd coincidence that you’re both here
because as it just so happens i’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality isn’t that right new friend and colleague bill nye the science guy sorry i replaced you with a newer model
that’s what i told my lawyers
mr nye hello i’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense
he said i’d be speaking to a class
no i said you were teaching someone a lesson now let’s go
what are you guys working on
oh uh we’re making nano vacuum tubes
haven’t you stolen enough from me back off bow tie
hey guys what do you think
thanks target four ninetynine i’m getting a drink
ah i’m making a necklace for my mom
yeah she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch so i wanted to do something to let her know i was thinking about her
they’re just having a little trouble communicating my dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again
look who’s here to put the jew in jewellery night
oh sure so it’s fine when you say it
sorry we’re late i wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use
i didn’t know you were coming again
well last week was a blast plus i thought you might like having a guy here
so what tools did you bring
everything we need to make jewellery moulds here’s some silver a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down
maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire
rajesh do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace
i was gonna make a necklace for my mom but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck she’s just chins and fat and feet
okay we’re almost ready to go once we bond the wires we can test the tubes
this is so exciting i i feel like i’m 75 again
sheldon just sent me a picture of him and bill nye getting smoothies
can can i ask you a question
why do you put up with sheldon
oh uh you know because we’re friends
wow you ask really hard questions
look i know he can be aggravating but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose it’s just how he is but he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together
you you know you’re describing a dog
he did bite me once but in his defence i came up behind him while he was eating so…
you know what sheldon is the smartest person i have ever met and he’s a little broken and he needs me i guess i need him too
boy you will not let this go will you oh jeez
no i have to go pick him up bill nye ditched him at the smoothie place
he probably stole his wallet too
you know if you guys are interested there’s a technique where i can take a lock of your hair refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your dna in it
yeah see bernie’s engagement ring that came right off my mom’s back
he’s kidding if that were true it’d be so much bigger
my name is howard i can make your hair into diamonds my mom is morbidly obese everybody love me
whoa where is that coming from
i’ll tell you where it’s coming from all you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone
raj cool it he’s gonna make us hair diamonds
how am i ruining anything i’m just trying to help you make better jewellery
but this isn’t about the jewellery this is about me having a place where i can open up about my feelings
since when can’t you open up with me
there are just some things that i feel more comfortable sharing with the girls because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names or ask me if my koothrapanties are in a bunch
buddy i was just joking around
yeah well sometimes your jokes hurt
you’re right i didn’t realize i was making you feel that way it was very brave of you to tell me
they’re gonna have sex before sheldon and i do i know it
i’m surprised to see you here
yeah me too somewhere around the third floor i began to see a a white light
no no no i’m i’m here i’m here to see you
if you’re hoping to get in touch with bill nye i can’t help you i’ve been informed that he’s now bill nye the restraining order guy
no i i i was thinking if it isn’t too much trouble i’d like to get your opinion about my my paper
thank you it would be an honour
actually i don’t need that i hacked into your email account and read it
well first i think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing
second um i thought your paper was inspired
oh well that that means a lot to me
can i invite you in for tea
uh no no i i really i have i have to run
well i guess one cup wouldn’t hurt
well i was feeling bad about how i acted the other night so i made you a little something
you didn’t have to do that
well it was fun i used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us it’s a lightsabre belt buckle
wow this is so cool thanks
and that’s not even the best part see i have one too check it out you can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want
yeah and my eighth favourite episode of professor proton was alkaseltzer rocket you said plop plop fizz fizz oh what a blastoff it is remember remember that remember
he can’t help it he can’t he really can’t
oh wait here i’ll get some alkaseltzer we can build that rocket and we can shoot it at bill nye’s house as long as i’m not within 500 feet of it
so you uh you have you have any single grandmothers
hey can i ask you a question
you’ve had this dart board since i’ve known you but i’ve never seen you play
oh uh we played once i broke a window
leonard where are the skeeball tickets
yeah from when we went to the arcade three years ago i finally decided what prize i want hurry up
uh if i still have them they’re probably in the junk box
ooh what are you gonna get
none of your business but when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later you are most welcome to sniff it
oh thank you here get yourself an eraser for your troubles
oh i forgot about this my aunt made it for me when i started college
why because i got an ugly itchy sweater and my brother got a car no i was her favorite
i seem to be a few tickets short are there more in the box
hmm i think i got them all nope they’re not in there
well you barely looked let me see
no no no i i looked and there’s there’s there’s no more tickets
leonard let me look in the box
okay okay i’m gonna show you what’s in the box but just promise not to flip out
why would i flip out is it a spider it’s a spider
no if it was a spider lenny would’ve flipped out
okay sheldon i know i was supposed to return this dvd a long time ago and i know we rented it on your card but it’s been like seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened so ininininstead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are what if this one time you just tried staying calm
that seems like a reasonable request although so did hey leonard would you mind returning that dvd
i’m sorry i’ll i’ll take care of it
i mean it i’m going to
and you’re going to stay calm
how about that sheldon’s being reasonable
yeah it’s freaking me out i’m gonna go
so when you say you’re not going to freak out about the dvd here’s what that means don’t fixate on it don’t wake me up in the middle of the night or nag me through the door while i’m on the toilet
okay first talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either okay remember when you can hear me i can hear you and second you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me it’s it’s like a an itch in my brain i can’t scratch
when i broke my arm i used to stick a coat hanger down there you ever try that maybe go in through the ear
you wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way i feel
well i don’t know how to do that
how about this i promise i won’t pester you about the dvd you can defecate in peace that’s a win for both of us but until this matter is resolved i would like you to wear this sweater with nothing underneath it
you say it’s itchy and uncomfortable i say situations like this make me feel the same way
i’m telling you try the hanger
put it on let’s share the experience
you got it if this sweater shuts you up i’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know now all i need to do is head down to the video store and return the dvd
oh did i forget to tell you that store went out of business years ago
penny can we please get our drinks
yeah hang on just give me sec
at work today i did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery
cool at my lab i performed ten laser capture microdissections
i scraped gum off the bottom of that table only ’cause my manager saw me put it there
oh my gosh that’s the girl that broke rajesh’s heart
i don’t know why but i always pictured her as indian
i think that reason’s called racism
i’m gonna go talk to her
why what are you gonna say
i’m not gonna say anything i just want to check her out because she hurt my friend my indian friend who’s racist now
you because you just called him your indian friend
hey can i start you off with something to drink
okay um you’re lucy right i’m a friend of raj koothrappali’s actually amy recognized you
yeah this is none of my business but why did you break up with him in an email
oh i don’t know i guess i thought it would be easier
yeah i get that i’ll go get you your water when you say easier you mean easier for you right ‘cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him
any chance i can get a different waitress
i’m sorry this is rude of me i will go get that water see see see see just now you expressed your feelings to my face how come you could do that with me but not raj
you know what the worst part is you’re sitting here perfectly happy and he’s at home a blubbering mess
oh i thought you said he was okay
well i also said i was getting you water but look at me still standing here you know i may be a bad waitress but you are a bad person now you want to hear the specials
so you can never take it off
is the point that you’re an idiot
gentlemen please leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes he can’t walk in my actual shoes he has the feet of a toddler
so how are you gonna return the dvd if the store went out of business
monday morning i’ll go downtown look up the owner’s information and send him the dvd pay the late fee and prove to sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic ah
and the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires
you didn’t have smokey the bear in india
no oh is he anything like uh munmun the mongoose he taught us not to play with cobras
you had to be taught not to play with cobras
you had to be taught not to burn down the forest
hey if you guys were hungry why didn’t you order something at the restaurant
we did you never brought it
oh that’s right nachos and a turkey club
well i was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your i want to say salmon
so how are you gonna tell raj abut what you did
what do you mean how what’s the big deal
you told lucy he was a pathetic mess
then you made her cry and leave
okay you guys are overreacting raj is gonna appreciate how i had his back
what is wrong with you penny you ruined any chance i had of getting back with lucy now she knows i’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure phone text sound it’s lucy she wants to meet for coffee i love you penny
i’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy
yeah it’s great you’re here i’d love to get an engineer’s opinion
this chair is squeaky now do i fix it or get a new one
well sheldon it took me all morning but i found the owner of the video store and i am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep drunk at the bottom of a pool anyway there is no one to return the dvd to so this issue is resolved ah and i’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable i didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me
you know you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin
hey that next of kin thing sounds pretty good
can i ask you guys a question so i’m seeing lucy tomorrow night and i’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me how do you do it
you can’t let her know you’re hurting you know the key is confidence
why is the key always confidence how come it’s never love handles and flop sweat
if this girl hurt you so much are you sure you want to see her again
well if i may he has so little selfrespect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to youtube and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride
he’s right but in my defence if we could survive that we could survive anything
well if you’re sure you want to do this it’s only coffee just relax and see what happens
well can i say she looks nice
can i tell her i miss her
oh can i show her an oil painting i made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren
i’d save that for the second date
good good ‘cause no matter how hard i try i cannot get the twins to look alike
oh i’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so i can return the dvd and see the look on sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that i didn’t let this get to me
sheldon’s not here why don’t you take the sweater off
oh i don’t know who cares look at me
oh my god is that sweater made of bees come on take it off i won’t tell
no no honey if i take it off sheldon wins
sweetie every night you don’t kill him in his sleep he wins
no it’s it’s almost done i just i have to find the next of kin and send ’em the dvd and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so i can get a skin graft
what is that what is that for
so you can send it to princeton and get your money back
i must say sheldon you’re handling this dvd business with an impressive amount of maturity
i don’t know why that surprises you i’m a grown man as should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel
is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing
the more interesting question you should be asking is what does this flower smell like
i’m gonna go with sad so what’s the story with you and this dvd
there’s nothing to tell maybe i purchased a book entitled don’t sweat the small stuff and i followed its wise suggestions one of which was stop and smell the flowers
hello oh it’s so good to see you
please sit i uh i got you a cappuccino i remembered it was your favourite i also got crumb cake but i remembered it was my favourite and i ate it anyway uh how are you
i’m pretty good listen i just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an email
well and i ate all the crumb cake we both made mistakes
i’m so happy you asked me here and i hope we can hang out again sometime you know as friends lovemaking partners whatever
oh uh i’m kind of seeing someone
i think i know the answer to this but just to be clear it’s not me right
this is all your fault i should’ve listened to munmun because i’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is penny why are you so cruel do you enjoy my pain
there’s a girl at the cheesecake factory i can set you up with
how is it i can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower
i think the real question is why do you waste your time with cheap childish pranks
there’s probably a deep reason which i’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can
okay sheldon i am out of options video store owner nursis manookian has no next of kin
well you seem hot under the collar or is that the sweater
oh oh no no it’s because i spent all afternoon at the armenian church where his funeral mass was held according to father solakian no one attended luckily my trip wasn’t a complete waste i lit a candle and prayed for your death but i’m not armenian so it probably won’t work this is over right
oh not necessarily i suggest you look for longlost relatives either in armenia or lebanon
listen to me sheldon i am not going to lebanon to return super mario brothers the movie
you know it might be fun you love hummus
why isn’t this bothering you isn’t your brain getting itchy this is on your card this could be ruining your credit score why isn’t this making you crazy
leonard i have something to tell you but i want you to promise not to flip out
seven years ago i found out the dvd was late and i paid for it
i was going to mention it at the time but then i thought some day this might be a teachable moment
aaaah i you how can what
i know and it wasn’t easy do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction
wow you’re even prettier than penny said i can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend
i don’t believe you you’re lying to me
oh it’s okay i have no morals and i’m desperately lonely i’ll be the other man if you want a little somethingsomething on the side
the math is all there it’s not real
yeahuh look it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow even you with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders you couldn’t do it
it’s horrible why would you push a cow over they’re sacred
oh stop it i’ve seen you eat like a million hamburgers
hey an animal can be both sacred and delicious
look i’m telling you i’ve done it okay i clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side
i was 16 in nebraska what do you think
i think you’re the one who fell over
that would explain why the sky was also on its side
howard cow tipping real or not
mmm i’m gonna say not that’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring speaking of that big side of beef uh she’s invited all of you to thanksgiving at her house
mmm you know i’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse so i’d love to go but unfortunately that sounds awful
uh we were actually gonna do it here
please bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town and i never have anything to say to that guy
oh since you put it that way i’d love to go but that sounds even more awful
it’d actually be nice to not hear sheldon complain about my cooking all day
uh excuse me but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year i criticize it do our traditions mean nothing to you
ugh fine i’ll go but if her food is delicious thanksgiving is ruined and it’s on you
do we really have to go to mrs wolowitz’s house
we do and i expect you to be on your best behaviour
now i know how the african slaves felt being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man
are you honestly comparing thanksgiving dinner at wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind
sheldon you can have a nice thanksgiving anywhere i spent one in vegas
yeah back when i was dating zack it was actually more fun than i thought we gambled we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels we had a really good turkey dinner which was surprising since we were at a strip club
wait you went to a chapel
we had one of those silly fake weddings
penny you know those are real right
let me ask you a question at any point was las vegas on its side
oh you brought beer for everybody
uh okay yeah it’s for everybody i really just wanted to have a nice quiet day at home and watch the game
you can have a quiet day and watch the game here
you just took it at least let it reach your first stomach entering hey mike let me help you out there
thanks what’s wrong with your mom
oh her gout’s flaring up turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away
how can one little toe hurt so bad
maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn she should quiet down soon i gave her enough pain meds to choke a well her
i guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking
if you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself you’re crazy
i was gonna make raj do it all by himself
oh well that’s a great idea
yes like we’re on a ship coming from africa to america
sheldon that’s completely inappropriate you can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave
i can’t believe you’re married to that idiot
ugh would you stop we just did it as a goof
well a goof or not you’re actually married you need to get this taken care of
i will why are you making this such a big deal
oh oh oh i have a reason it could be because you said yes to marrying zack but every time leonard’s proposed he’s gotten a resounding no yeah that’s just off the top of my head
so how do i undo this
i’m hoping you can get an annulment it’s just like it never happened
great well what do i have to do
it says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met were you unable to consummate the marriage
is there any evidence of fraud bigamy want of understanding
want of understanding what does that even mean
ding ding ding we have a winner
ah no problem it wouldn’t be thanksgiving without an indian providing the food uh now where does your mom keep the crisco
um i don’t know probably in a wad in her cheek
i’ll help raj in here why don’t you go keep my dad company
he doesn’t want me in there i’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter
don’t be silly he loves you
okay he cares about you a lot
i do crap for you all the time get out there
so your wife’s in arizona with the grandkids
you know my mom’s been to arizona she rode one of those mules down in the grand canyon long story short they had to shoot it ‘cause she’s so fat i’ll get the door while you finish laughing hey guys
it smells wonderful is anyone slaving away in the kitchen because i too know…
here thank you for having us
oh she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to zack
really that dumbass she used to date that’s hysterical
i can’t believe i felt bad for opening this in the car
uh yeah can you uh reach that uh gravy boat up there
great that makes one of you okay we have a lot to do and not much time to do it bernadette you’re on corn gravy and yam detail amy you’re on rolls cranberries and making sure bernadette stays away from the marshmallows that’s right i see you okay if you have any questions i’ll be over here basting my ass off focus is key
did you guys know penny married zack three years ago
no but i did get tackled in the hallway once the whole school cheered
okay i found the uh court papers that you and zack need to fill out i’ll print them when we get home
and we can just put this whole thing behind us
look i get it i screwed up is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day
why are you mad at me you’re the one that did the stupid thing i’m just trying to fix it
i don’t know the first thing about women but i would not follow her
how am i the bad guy she’s the one who married someone else i’m the victim
sounds like zack’s the victim you’re sleeping with his wife
i’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years can i weigh in here
i’m trying to watch the game shut up oh how do you not make a first down there
they passed against a nickel defence they should have run it offtackle
how the hell do you know that
my father loved football he always made me watch it before i was allowed to do my homework
well you’ll be happy to know i just spoke to zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers he’s on his way here now
i’m getting ready to weigh in again
what do you think they ought to do now
i would throw a quick slant to a wideout given that the defence is showing blitz
oh i love a good blitz especially with sour cream get it ‘cause it sounds like blintz
i just don’t understand why you invited him here today
because you wouldn’t shut up about it when i called him he had nothing to do so i just thought it would…
hey guys i’m trying to cook in here
oh sorry we’ll keep it down
no no speak up i’m about to use the blender and i don’t want to miss anything
well you might have to cook for one more because she invited zack
my my the plot like my gravy thickens
i don’t care for your mother’s bathroom there’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you
yeah that’s why you remember the thanksgiving game when it snowed in dallas
1993 leon lett blew the game in the final seconds and the dolphins emerged victorious then i finally got to do my calculus
i was so pissed i wanted to shoot my tv
so was my dad and then he did
so does your dad still live in texas
no he died when i was 14
so was the man who owned the local liquor store he cried and cried
oh thanks so if your dad died when you were 14 you were never old enough to have a beer with the man
no sir he did try to give me one for my high school graduation but i was 11 and my mom said no
well you’re having one with me
i never had a beer with my dad either
do you mind we’re having a moment here
i can’t believe penny’s married to zack
wonder what she saw in that guy
i don’t know he’s sweet he’s tall handsome
hmm wonder what she sees in leonard
sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me
i know how you feel sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that roomba vacuum i kick it when he’s not looking
they’re drinking beer and watching football
so why don’t you do that with them
well sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more and they were toasting and i tried to tell them about how sad i was when my dad abandoned…
sorry i really want to hear how sad you are i’ll be back in like five ten minutes
sorry she made you come over here on a holiday
it’s all right i didn’t have anything going on plus penny told me we’re married and thanksgiving’s a time to be with family
yeah okay great can we just get this over with
yeah uh you guys have to sign here and here on monday we’ll file for the annulment and this marriage will be over
i don’t know if i want to sign it
i just think splitting up can be rough on kids
are you sure ‘cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning
okay look zack come on you know neither of us thought this was real i mean we were married by an elvis impersonator
of course it was an impersonator we could never afford a real elvis
you married him instead of me good call sign the papers
hang on you know what you have been a jerk about this all day you always do this whenever i mess up you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it
yeah we could’ve waited till monday signed the papers this all would have been over
you’re the one who invited him here
oh there you go again just another mistake you’re throwing in my face
not cool bro i’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy i want dating my wife
yeah well she’s not gonna be your wife for long
i’m about to sign the paper
know what they say happy wife happy life let’s eat
two three eight four six normal that’s all i can do without throwing up
that is not what i expected when you said you were gonna burp pie
i don’t know what’s scarier the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there
all i know is you can only fit one of her in a car and there’s the clown that came out of her i really didn’t want to come here but this is shaping up to be one of the best thanksgivings i’ve had in a long time
hey howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day now both of you apologize right now
she’s so tiny it’s funny when she’s mad
all right mister i think you owe howard and bernadette an apology
perhaps you’re right i’m sorry for my behaviour i’ve had alcohol and it’s caused me to be inappropriate
now how’s about you get us a couple of beers
well i couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls martha stewart and rachael ray
hey sheldon what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin
this is a jewish house i don’t think they have pigskin
hey i’m sorry about today and i promise next time i get married it won’t be a joke it’ll be for love or money
don’t be it’s my fault i was a terrible husband i was never around
i know i’m hard on you but you’re not the worst soninlaw in the world
mike that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me
i just vomited on a lot of clowns
thank you uh the university made me come here i didn’t want to uh big fan of the show
so i understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake
and some people in the science community are calling it the wonder blunder
who give me their names i bet it’s wolowitz
it’s just such a fascinating story your calculations are way off but they find the element anyway it’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure
can we talk about something else do you know that i yodel
that’s interesting but this could be taking you down the path toward a nobel prize and in chemistry no less and wouldn’t that be unusual because you’re a physicist
yes yes i’d be a physicist with a nobel in chemistry everyone laugh at the circus freak you know i don’t need to sit here and take this flatow it is because of bullies like you every day more and more americans are making the switch to television
president seibert i don’t know why you’re yelling you’re the one who made me go on the radio i was expecting a professional science interview not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock well if the university needs money so badly perhaps you should start a swear jar whoa that one’s worth a dollar
i know you don’t like it but every time you do an interview it raises the profile of the university that translates to funding
yeah well i’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins
of course you’re not people love trained monkeys
how can you not be happy you’re tall thin and famous oh my god i’m jealous of sheldon
look you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while you’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it
but none of you know what this is like being celebrated for something you wish you never did
mmm you clearly haven’t been with me at mardi gras
want to pause the video game and help me clean up
i am cleaning up look at the mess the joker made of gotham city
come on it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here
raj grew up in india trust me he’s seen worse
i promise i’ll help out the rest of the week
the rest of the week you said it was just gonna be a night or two
yeah but if i told you a week would you have said yes
then you left me no choice
i love raj but that’s a long time for a house guest
i know but they’re tenting his building he can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs
for a whole week the nerve of some people
here comes the embarrassment express with stops at fraudville wonder blunderberg and kansas city because it’s a hub
good i don’t deserve cookies come in wil
hey sheldon it’s been a while
amy said you were having a rough time and i thought maybe we could talk is that okay
certainly although right now i’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque
sheldon you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did
yeah i know a little something about that
oh nonsense wil your endless tweets are not that bad
i remember why it’s been a while sheldon i was actually talking about when i was a kid on star trek
how could you not like getting attention for playing wesley crusher you were wonderful a knowitall boy genius with an eidetic memory who couldn’t relate to that
well not everybody felt that way a lot of people really hated the character and some of them hated me because of it i would do interviews and people would be mean to me
that just happened to me next time you’re stuck for a tweet feel free to say what a jerk ira flatow is
sheldon the point is wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things
yeah i’m an author now i do public speaking and i have my own web series about board games
uh we’re trying to cheer him up so…
i’m just saying that there was a time when i thought i would never get out of wesley crusher’s shadow but now it’s just one small part of a pretty great life and it’s a part that i’m happy is there
i do see what you’re saying that helps
would you two like to stay and play trains with me
oh great now i work the controls i say all aboard you sit quietly and watch
you’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch
no i’m gonna brush cinnamon’s teeth
why bother she spends half the time licking her butt
and the other half licking my face that’s why i’m brushing her teeth
hey guys sorry i’m so late did you already have dinner
no we were waiting for you
yeah so what do you feel like making
howard the poor thing just got home from work let me get you a glass of wine i’ll cook dinner
don’t be silly sit you look like you’ve had a long day
no she always looks like that because she married an idiot
please this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here now tell us all about your day
okay um well first i was late to a meeting ’cause i was stuck in traffic
well i keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone
hey when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans did i tell you how to fix it no i said aw that must hurt and i rubbed your belly
i thought of you the whole time
all i’m saying is there’s a time to just listen
there’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans and it’s when you’re ten
hello president siebert thank you for taking my call i just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery oh no no no no no need to thank mno thank my friend wil wheaton for your information i have nine friends hmm ten if we include you nine it is ah it’s ten i’ll count wolowitz hello friend leonard
hey you’re in a good mood
well you’re about to be in an even better one i didn’t want to say anything until i knew for sure but i’ve been rerunning the tests on your element in my lab and i disproved it your element does not exist
yeah but what about the chinese research team they found it
yeah it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files they faked the results
yes do you know what that means that means all of this attention that you hate goes away
you robbed me of my greatest achievement
i’m back down to nine friends make it eight i’m sick of wolowitz too
i i don’t understand all you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain i was trying to make you happy
by taking away my only claim to fame well if you wanted to make me happy you could have told me a joke or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends
oh there is no winning with you and koalas and otters don’t even live near each other
that’s what makes their friendship unlikely
hey what’s with all the yelling
leonard disproved my element now all the attention is going to go away
oh that’s great you must be thrilled
that’s it i’m down to seven friends
he’s counting hobbits and superheroes right
when i thought the element was real i didn’t want it but now that leonard made it not exist i want it more than anything in the world
the the element never existed i didn’t take it away science took it away be mad at science
don’t you dare use science against me science is my best friend oh good i’m back up to eight
will you tell him he’s out of his mind
actually i get what he’s saying
oh yes nine welcome back buddy
it’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever
i have no idea what she’s talking about but we’re ganging up on you so i agree
okay sheldon what do you want me to do hide the information if i don’t publish it it’s just a matter of time before someone else does
no no of course you have to publish that’s your responsibility as a scientist doing otherwise would be unethical you have no choice
how do you know i didn’t do them
because once when all the knives were dirty you cut a bagel with your keys
good morning everybody i picked up coffee while i was out bernadette here’s your soy peppermint mocha
aw you didn’t have to do that
oh my pleasure and don’t worry about your presentation today you’re gonna be great
yeah you’re gonna knock it out of the park
what presentation do i have today
what are you doing are you trying to make me look bad
i’m just being a good house guest
no you’re being a better husband than i am doing the dishes getting coffee knowing about her life who does that
oh come on i brought you one too
that’s why i got you hot chocolate
give me that just stop showing me up
howard listen to me you’re a great husband yes your listening skills could use some work but it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an overprotective mom
hey i just wanted to let you know that i i posted my findings
i saw and i just posted a retraction of my paper now the whole scientific community knows i was wrong
these things happen all the time sheldon
not to me the only other retraction i ever had to issue was when i was seven and i conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in east texas but that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit
thew he is it’s my favowite superhewo the wetwactor
come on don’t give him a hard time
i’m sowwy cooper i wetwact it by the way hofstadter nice job dispwoving the chinese team
it’s a huge deal cooper maybe physics just isn’t your thing have you ever considered a caweer in wetail that way you could take things back for a wiving
no no no that’s okay i can fight my own battles isn’t that right bawwy
is is that a wefewence to my speech impediment that’s pwetty hurtful i i can’t contwol it
you’re right that was uncalled for i take it back
of course you do because you’re the wetwactor
raj this dinner was amazing if you’re here much longer i’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes
nonsense you need a little fattening up you’ve been looking too skinny lately
aw howie how come you never say anything sweet like that
what are you talking about remember last week when i asked you if you were wearing spanx and you weren’t how’s that different
maybe you could try being more thoughtful like your friend raj
yeah well maybe you could try being more like raj
yeah yeah he packed me a lunch this morning and there was a note inside that said go get ’em
like i don’t do enough around here now i need to pack your lunch and by the way why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em you’re a grown man you should know to go get ’em
i do know to go get ’em but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when i’m going and getting them
hey hey do you hear yourselves let’s just you know all calm down and take a step back
this is stupid why are we fighting
i don’t know i guess i was just feeling like i’m a lousy husband
you’re not a lousy husband you’re a great husband i was the one feeling like a lousy wife
are you kidding you’re the best i know what the problem is it’s him
you made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough
yeah we were totally fine halfassing our marriage till you showed up
look i’m sorry you’re upset with me but i just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page
oh it does feel good to have you backing me up for once
i back you up all the time
that is not… he’s doing it again
i can’t believe they kicked you out
i can’t believe they’re still married oh no i forgot cinnamon’s toothbrush at howard’s i guess you’re sharing with daddy again
bark once if you need me to call peta
what’s that animal doing in our apartment
oh relax she’s in her crate she can’t get out
i have two words for you jurassic park this day just keeps getting worse and worse
you know if it makes you feel any better…
sheldon it’s a beautiful night why don’t you and i go for a nice walk together
oh everything is just sex with you isn’t it
sheldon i think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take she can only be there for you as much as you are for her
and amy you need to be patient with sheldon instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms
i’m ira flatow and this is science friday i’d like to welcome back dr sheldon cooper who thought he had discovered a new superheavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest dr leonard hofstadter welcome to science friday gentlemen
thank you ira if i may i’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week
now isn’t there something you’d like to say to me
no now dr hofstadter can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory
i believe i can answer that
you’re telling it wrong ira to really understand the story here you have to start at the very beginning a small town in east texas where a young genius named…
that’s right sheldon cooper he was bitten by his neighbour’s dog leading to his first scientific breakthrough the doggie deathray which sadly he couldn’t build because santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium
you know i’d really like to hear it from dr hofstadter if it’s okay with you
what a surprise did you invite me back just so you could ignore me
actually i didn’t invite you you came in you took a seat and i’m not comfortable with confrontation
sheldon this interview is supposed to be about me
well that seems like a snooze even for public radio
you know if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing this would be one hell of a drinking game
a little early for alcohol isn’t it
you know i don’t just say smart things about science i also yodel does
wow you’re really good at this
well i have an extremely low centre of gravity i’m like a pyramid
oh i hope it’s just a sprain i cannot walk into that er with another video game injury
hey sheldon you want to play next
oh i would but i’m on my way out
yes my sister’s uterus came down with a baby
oh she’s pregnant that’s great you’re gone an uncle uncle sheldon
no i will be uncle dr cooper
how come you never said she was pregnant
well i never told you about my brother’s kidney stone you want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals
well congrats and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister
yes i’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident lucky duck
wow so how long will you be gone
well she’s due tomorrow although it did take her six years to finish high school so who knows
can i give you a ride to the airport
oh no thank you i don’t want to be an inconvenience chopchop leonard we leave in ten minutes
all right here’s the deal sheldon is gone so the tree decorating rules are out the window
yeah which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornamentspacing template
and i’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars
wait so star wars and star trek characters can go on the same branch
i know it’s crazy welcome to the thunderdome people all whoop
i’ve never done this before it’s kind of fun
yeah if your mom could see her little bar mitzvah boy right now she’d have a heart attack
good idea i’ll take a picture
honey i’m a little strapped for cash this year so for christmas i was thinking of giving you this
but it is what you got me last year
oh good i’m glad you guys didn’t wait for me to start although you said seven and it’s it’s seven but that’s fine
oh it’s probably sheldon hi sheldon everybody’s here say hi
the second i go out of town you throw a christmas party without me
that’s so thoughtful you guys are the best
ishe went into labor an hour ago
that’s wonderful so you’re at the hospital
no she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the stone age and a cave wasn’t available
you know many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones
and turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic slip ‘n slide
shelly come on your sister’s fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there’s blood everywhere
oh boy i picked the wrong day to wear my good robot tshirt
if you were having sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room
yeah if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby i’ll give you ten dollars
hey i brought over it’s a wonderful life if you guys want to watch it later
it’s great it’s christmastime and jimmy stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself
don’t need to see it living it
but then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born
hey you ever imagine what that would be like not being born
knock knock knock what do you think knock knock knock what do you think knock knock knock what do you think
you make jokes about sheldon but if it weren’t for him i don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now
really sheldon not being here is the main reason i’m in this room
it’s true none of you would know me you wouldn’t know bernadette you wouldn’t be dating penny
you don’t know that i’ve been going to the cheesecake factory for years i could have picked her up general laughter
okay sweetie let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down
i’m gonna do it i’m gonna ask her out
i’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples sorry i thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen
maybe this time he’s going to do it
hope you’re thirsty here it comes
hey you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes
you didn’t ask her out but that was a lot of sounds
you guys are making me nervous
fine then go talk to her on your own
really you don’t sound so sure
no i am he uh any anyway um there’s been something i’ve wanted to ask you for a long time um
eh uh well i was wondering if you’re not too busy um uh if if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is
come on i would not have peed my pants
but you forget i did ask you out in real life
which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her which couldn’t have happened without sheldon same goes with you guys if leonard wasn’t with penny she never would have set you up
doesn’t matter bernadette still would’ve been working at the cheesecake factory and i still would’ve been working this beefcake factory you would’ve been all over me
hey penny can i take that table
the one in the turtleneck is cute
open wide here comes the happy train
oh hang on you got a you got a little something ah
oh man that is so us
you know maybe you and i wouldn’t be together but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself
because i know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with
hey did you remember to pay the rent
better i used the money to buy these magic beans
hey he may be an idiot but at least he didn’t pee himself
no it’s not i’ve seen things lady things
listen to me that is not the way they usually look
doesn’t matter this is no way to make new humans people coming out of people it’s some kind of dirty magic show
sheldon lee cooper you get back in this room right now and bring a mop
did you hear that a mop i have two phds yet somehow i’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal
hey sheldon sent us all an email happy holidays from texas and there’s pictures aah don’t open them do not open them
oh come on childbirth is a natural beautiful uuurgh it’s like someone sawed a cow in half
my father’s a gynaecologist i think i can handle it and now i’m gay
you know i was thinking without sheldon most of us would have never met but penny would still live across from him
and with leonard out of the picture we all know what that would mean
of course i’m doing laundry saturday night is laundry night and i’m in a laundry room so i believe your inference is justified
oh my inference is justified sheldon you are so funny anyway i need to do my laundry too because these clothes are so dirty almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them
a tad asymmetrical but nothing to be concerned about
i’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt
come on sheldon you and me right here
penny for the thousandth time i’m saving myself for someone special perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud
i think i know how to change your mind
oh good is the baby born yet
i don’t know i just got back
my mother asked me to get some towels i took advantage of the vague request and went to bed bath  beyond scream from other room excuse me i’m on the phone so rude
here’s another one penny if it weren’t for sheldon you never would have met comic book legend stan lee
at least leonard howard and i would have always been friends
hey how come you three never got an apartment together
we talked about it but howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom
i lived with her to save money
yeah you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breastfeeding
aw so i guess if it weren’t for me you’d still be living with her huh
what do you mean not exactly
well things would be a little different
howard where’s my lunch i’m starving
i know you’re starving the neighbours know you’re starving there’s starving people in africa who know you’re starving
that’s it there’s not enough food
well you cleaned out earth i don’t know what else to do
you didn’t let me finish here you go mother
wait did she die or did you kill her
eh tomato tomahto the important thing is she’s dead
hey so how come you two didn’t move in together
oh this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man
yeah i was wrong but i do think you and i would have had a great time
hang on why would i be fat
you’d have no girlfriend to see you naked you’d try to fill the void with food and i’m an enabler who once deepfried a pancake
why can’t you be fat too
what do you want to do for dessert
i just wanted to be in anyone’s story
yeah but why are you fat
amy what about you what do you think you’d be doing if you never met sheldon
it’s hard to say my life would be so different
you can say better sheldon can’t hear you
happy birthday to me happy birthday to me there’s tears in the frosting happy birthday to me stuart honks a party hooter at her
that’s it the baby’s here it’s a boy
oh thank you i wasn’t sure i was gonna to make it but my mother gave me some ice chips my sister told me to breathe and i just thought to myself sheldon if you can make it through the green lantern movie you can make it through this
well good for you buddy we’ll let you get back in there
oh no no i’m not going back in there that baby is so irritating he has literally been crying his entire life
aw he’s already taking after uncle shelly
come on sheldon you should go
well you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up and now you can be one for your nephew
ugh all right i’ll go but from what i’ve seen his attention span is as limited as his bladder control
you actually got him to do it
yeah you keep saying how much sheldon has affected all of us but you’ve clearly had an impact on him
if that were true i wouldn’t still be living alone well not exactly alone i do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of sheldon’s tshirts on it
i’m telling you sheldon cares for you more than you think
i wish i could believe you i also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in rice sheldon
hang on i’m gonna give you a little early christmas present i’m gonna show you something but if you ever told sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again so if you want to tell him that’s fine look
oh wow i had no idea he is so into me wait wait where’d i go
oh well it’s you swamp thing stephen hawking spiderman but look you’re in the mix
i am in the mix and i’m the hottest one
me too i got a lot of tv to catch up on
to quote han solo i know
i would’ve preferred to have you there with me
and how did it make you feel
looking into the blank innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything i was saying basically just another day at the office
i’m gonna do it i’m gonna ask her out
and chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples
uh your phone number and one more cheesecake
i’m sorry i have a boyfriend in fact there he is now ready to go sweetheart
not until i get my kiss
this is nice that we all get to eat together
hmm can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation
we can but thanks to steve jobs we don’t have to
guys guys you’re never gonna believe this
i just got a part on a tv show
um nc… ii… or you know ncstd… i don’t know it’s it’s you know it’s the one with the letters and i’m gonna be on it
um i play a customer in a diner and i flirt with mark harmon
ooh mark harmon he’s a dreamboat
uh no reason i just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination
so i read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number
is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue
if you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth i could set you up with my mom
why is that funny that’s just unhygienic
i don’t think so i believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist for example uh wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet or exercise or both see the twist is that people don’t usually change well they don’t
hey guys don’t forget my episode’s on tv tomorrow night
oh that’s so sweet of you but i was gonna steal food from here you know my treat
wait if howard’s mother is coming then you should also steal marbles because she’s obese and hippos are obese and in the popular board game hungry hungry hippos they eat marbles maybe i need to dumb these down for you
leonard do you think i’m funny
i take it back that was funny
the philosopher henri bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object
i bet that bit killed at the chuckle hut
oh he didn’t perform standup comedy he was a philosopher
you know i think we’re zeroing in on your problem
perhaps i’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time unless they’re german ’cause that’s a tough crowd
are you set on people laughing with you ‘cause if you’re cool with at you…
raj when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch penny’s thing tonight i didn’t think you meant stuart
really i never for a second thought it’d be anything else
i almost met someone last night but i blew it i was walking cinnamon and this girl introduced herself but she was so cute i panicked and said wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts
well stuart’s cute in his own way
when i was a baby my mother called me her little possum
if you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls maybe you should practice by talking to regular people
you mean like fatties and uggos
i’m serious go to the mall talk to anybody practice that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl it won’t be so scary
or just keep dating the possum
we haven’t even gotten to my scene yet
i know but you’re going to be a tv star and you haven’t left me yet that takes guts
i don’t know about you but i’m very uncomfortable with all this
i’ve never seen this show before and now i’m starting with episode 246 it’s unnatural
just think of the first 245 as the prequel
okay shh guys guys this is it
i guess it’s you and me kid
well the diner scene where’s my diner scene
well don’t ask me until i see the prequel i’m lost
no there was supposed to be a big scene with me and mark harmon but it’s gone
this doesn’t make any sense i mean i i thought i did a a really good job i… excuse me
i’ve been studying how to make people laugh they say that comedy is tragedy plus time let’s tickle some ribs
no dad i don’t think they cut me out of the show because i was too pretty no i don’t need you to come out and kick mark harmon’s ass daddy i gotta go i love you bye
ugh this is such a disaster my parents had all my relatives over they got one of those sixfoot sandwiches and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing and they’re probably in mexico by now so humiliating
you still got the part that’s a huge accomplishment
yeah but this was supposed to be my break okay people were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things more auditions more parts now none of that’s gonna happen
honey you only had like three lines that wasn’t gonna happen anyway
oh come on no that’s not what i meant
i don’t look you know words don’t always have to mean things
i think you meant that you don’t believe in me
nope uh uh i might not know what i meant but i know that i didn’t mean that not this guy oh no way
i want you right now to give me your 100 honest opinion
do you think i have what it takes to really make it as an actress
so you think i’ll be on tv and in movies and win awards
i don’t know i got all confused when you said honestly
look do i think that you are talented and that you are beautiful of course i do but isn’t los angeles full of actresses who are just as talented just as beautiful all right look we’ll come back to that
no please don’t stop go on tell me how i’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life
that is not what i said look i think you’re really good i truly do but this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for i mean the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one
this is interesting apparently a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise
well that makes sense the prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation and patients with brain lesions on their…
sheldon you scared me that wasn’t funny
or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex
okay the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd i mean humour is a complex neurological… sheldon drops his trousers okay that’s pretty good
no no pretty girls the point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls
fine how about that old lady with the walker
that depends on any level do you think she’s hot
now would you say ointment is more equal to or less funny than kumquat
i don’t think i want to go out with you anymore
will you please stop joking around i’m trying to figure this out
sheldon how many words are you gonna go through
you didn’t get your part cut
and you didn’t get your part cut yep bunch of old guys rocking out in a band all with erectile dysfunction you didn’t get your part cut
we can but the part of penny might get cut
that was really crappy of me what you’re trying to do is hard but people do make it and i really do believe you could be one of them
and to show you how much i believe in you i kind of got you an audition
what how did you manage that
there’s this thing online you put yourself on tape and just send it in anyone can do it
come on leonard this is just a pr stunt
so even if it is you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds wolowitz sent his in two days ago
look maybe it is a long shot but sometimes long shots happen luke skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the death star he had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide but with the help of the force he… wow i can feel you hating me right now
how about that lady in the sweat suit speedwalking
yeah she seems friendly and easy to… never mind she’s gone you know maybe talking to people is too hard
we could go over to that department store practice on the mannequins
i don’t know they’re dressed very stylishly they’re probably stuckup this is ridiculous the next person that walks by no matter who it is they’re the one we’re gonna die here
he’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour
it’s exhausting do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knockknock joke that starts with knockknockknock amy knockknockknock amy knockknockknock amy
if you want him to stop sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh
fake a laugh do you ever do that with me
well i’d be able to tell anyway
please i’ve made plenty of girls laugh sometimes just by asking them out bernadette laughs uncontrollably yeah well i fake my orgasms
yes how much for a hundred longstemmed red roses really how much for three
look i know you were just trying to help with your star wars thing i didn’t mean to call it idiotic
well i don’t think you called it idiotic
oh sorry i meant to anyway um i was just upset with myself i wasn’t mad at you i just feel like everything is falling apart
no it’s not okay look at me okay i took a temp job as a waitress forever ago and i’m still doing it i can’t quit because guess what i can’t do anything else and i finally get my big break and it goes away i’m such a mess
really ‘cause this morning at starbucks a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg and it wasn’t the only one in there
okay listen to me this is just a minor setback
no it’s not okay i’ve been out here for like ten years i’ve nothing to show for it
you’re right i do have you mm let’s get married
ooh leonard hofstadter will you marry me
did you seriously just say um
look you know i love you but but you’re you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost
okay so so you don’t want to marry me
that is not what i said
no forget it i take it back offer’s off the table
who’s in the mood to laugh
but i used science to construct the perfect joke
no no i just need to be alone
so a sandwich a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar where are you going
i forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous
how about those guys on that bench over there they look pathetic i bet we could talk to them
uh do do you like being a mall security guard
would you like to talk about it
penny proposed and i didn’t say yes
does that mean the relationship is over
because i’m afraid to know the answer
that’s it you’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment
no you’re my friend and i’m sorry
did you just put a kick me sign on my back
no that wouldn’t be funny at all
star wars audition take one starring howard joel wolowitz reallife astronaut vader is here now on this moon i felt his presence he’s come for me he can feel when i’m near…
how many times do i have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty
i’m in the middle of something
the university they think they can do whatever they want we just have to sit there and take it
you need to let it go sheldon
you work tirelessly for someone and this is what you get
oh my god they’re just making you use your vacation days
but i don’t want a vacation
okay listen i don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through but i’m a little distracted right now
oh this again so penny proposed you didn’t say yes and now you think you may have lost her love forever how does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days
i’m gonna go talk to penny
i’m going to go inside put on my coziest pajamas curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over leonard knocks three times penny sorry
look i’m sorry i didn’t text you back i just needed some time to think
look if you want to break up just say it
no no no no i take it back don’t say it just just hate me but stay with me it worked for my parents
listen i don’t want to break up with you
oh oh okay good good so it’s cool if i cry a little
look you did the right thing last night i was a mess i was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere
look i get it and i want you to know that i support whatever you want to do
great because i’ve been thinking if i really want this acting thing to work i need to focus all my energy on it and to do that i should quit waitressing at the cheesecake factory
wow that that’s a big step
so well before making any rash…
come on take me to work with you
please what if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and i’m not there to see it
do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it
no i was just tricking you
leonard wait take me with you
too bad i’m coming with you
i said stay i’m going to work do not follow me
yes but at this point pretty much any customer does what can i do for you
well i need a little help i accidentally destroyed one of howard’s comic books this morning and was hoping i could replace it
batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron
well don’t let the riddler know that it’s a comic book joke or maybe it’s not
uh well it’s it’s pretty rare can you give me a few days to track it down
ooh i was kind of hoping to get it before howie comes home from work
well he’s always saying i should be more careful with my curling iron and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right
well i’ll do what i can but i can’t make any promises
you know i do work at a pharmaceutical company if you can make this happen today i can hook you up with anxiety medication antidepressants
really do you have any of these
hello mr rat brain not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now are we
hey what brings you guys here
well we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join
why because sheldon’s not here this week and you don’t think i have any other options i’m just kidding i’ll get my purse
hi amy i oh i’m sorry i didn’t know you had any company
that’s okay uh bert this is howard and rajesh guys this is bert
anyway i wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab
this is so pretty bert works for the geology department
yeah you know what uh geologists and bon jovi have in common
oh it’s okay i want you to have it bye
yeah he’s nice because he likes you
he brought you a pretty rock
so he does that every day oh
you know if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend bert it’s totally okay
are you sure he’s tall pale and awkward that sounds like your type
should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me
what do i do i don’t want to hurt his feelings
maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available does he know you’re dating sheldon
i guess it hasn’t come up
and does sheldon know you’re dating sheldon
i’m sorry who are you dating
i’m on vacation what do you think
why are you sitting in the stairwell
oh i have a ton of errands to run i need to make copies of my headshot send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class
okay you want to come with me
come on boy come on let’s go let’s go get in the car come on
all right thanks a lot they have one at capital comics
no it’s not i hate that place guy who owns it is a jerk he’s always making me feel bad about myself
oh that’s terrible what’s the address
you know why don’t i just take you there that way i can make sure he doesn’t rip you off
oh thanks but i don’twant you to close up i mean won’t you lose business sorry that was mean
penny really quit the cheesecake factory
so what is she doing today
i don’t know she already thinks i don’t support this so if i call it might look like i’m checking up on her
of course i do she’s a great actress i’m proud she’s taking this risk
you bought that great i got to call her before i forget how i said it hey
oh how’s it going you taking hollywood by storm
actually i’m at the cheesecake factory
you got your job back that is great news i didn’t want to say anything but you are making the right choice to plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane
yeah i’m just returning my uniform
before we begin your guided meditation close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment
okay i’m inside the cern super collider
now take a deep relaxing breath in through your nose and let it out
what was i gonna do two ins in a row where’s my lemonade
a fitting swan song to your career as a waitress to forget my order one last time
do you think quitting my job was a mistake
do you see me drinking lemonade
because leonard just pissed me off am i being an idiot or not
no i don’t think you are
the best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100 of your time and energy to it when i decided i was going to be a physicist i didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from ms pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year
thank you i needed to hear that why can’t leonard understand it
because he’s not like us penny we’re dreamers
yeah i need to start cracking the window when i leave you in the car
so anyway there’s this big uh rock and mineral show next week in santa monica
listen um bert before you say anything else i i have a boyfriend
oh this is awkward you thought i was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show
that’s very nice of you but i do have a boyfriend
that’s what you all say you just don’t want to go out with me because i have an offputting personality
no that’s not true my boyfriend has an offputting personality too like way worse than you
don’t worry i’m used to it i mean i’m big and weird and funnylooking and no one ever wants to do anything with me
it’s okay i know i’m a monster
no bert come on i’d love to go to the mineral show with you
yeah haven’t seen this many people in my store since that korean church bus crashed through my front window
haven’t seen you in forever look how grey you’ve gotten
my hair’s exactly the same colour as always
no i was talking about your skin
look uh my friend here needs a comic book
ooh and she went into your store by mistake good thing there was no one there to see you what do you need oh yeah yeah i got this right over here
can i offer you a coffee espresso latte
how about you stu mocha scone directions to the nearest soup kitchen
i’m just kidding he knows where the soup kitchen is
i don’t think i like the way you’re treating my friend
sorry you want the book or not
not from you let’s go stuart
you know something jesse you may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition but i have something more important
friendship which i would trade in a heartbeat for all of this
the mineral and rock show that would be awful even without bert
so what am i supposed to do now
prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring
this isn’t funny i’m gonna have to tell him the truth that even if i didn’t have a boyfriend i wouldn’t be interested in him
oh i’ve heard those words so many times from linda nosenchuck tammy rosenworcel
oh who was that girl from our starbucks
yes arlene she wrote no way on both our cappuccinos
poor bert that guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him
well how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested
i guess uh i’d like her to sit me down look me in the eye and say i was wrong i love you and then maybe she could touch me in a special way
that’s how you reject a guy
okay i don’t have time for this i’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest
he’ll be so upset he’ll probably climb up the empire state building and start swatting at planes
you want us to talk to him
sure we’ve both been in his shoes we’ll let him down with compassion and respect
so we tell him she’s a lesbian right
of course we tell him she’s a lesbian
and hold three two one very good now let’s try warrior 2 and hold
i’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals
yeah well i don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today
too bad it seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze
and now we go to reverse warrior
how did she get you to do yoga
well to be honest i thought she said yoda
i’m helping him relax because unlike you he supports me
oh how many times do i have to say it i support you
okay if you support me what was with that phone call
fine i’m not sure you should have quit but if you care so much what i think why didn’t you ask me before you did it
oh so now i need your permission would you have asked me before you quit your job
yes i thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together if i’m wrong then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in
i’m willing to if you guys are
can we please have some privacy
y no i’m as much a part of this relationship as you two and i think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table for example where is this going are you two ever getting married and if so where will we all live have you thought about that
okay wait what are we doing
for some reason we’re planning a future where we both live with sheldon forever
look i know you think i’m being reckless and you might be right but i need to take this shot
yeah no kidding despite what it says on her résumé she is no longer 22
i swear i am on your side
you keep saying you’re on my side but you don’t act like it
he does that to me too why do we put up with it
listen i could never do what you’re doing okay i would be terrified
well it’s scary for me too
my point is just because i couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t and i’m proud of you
well to celebrate this reconciliation let’s all share a milk shake uh penny you’ll need a straw
yes i am there’s a few more things i want to say to you stuart’s store is just fine and he’s a much nicer person than you are and if you still have that comic i’d like to buy it right now
no problem oh you want a latte while you wait
no i don’t want a latte i want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone
thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me
we’re sorry amy didn’t want to go
eh who needs her when i have you guys rock show rock show rock show rock show rock show rock show rock shoooooow
oh it all comes down to this
don’t get soft on me hofstadter i will slap those glasses right off your face
hey we’re about to buy tickets for comiccon
they sell out incredibly fast but as long as one of us gets in we can buy passes…
good lord this is not the time for flirting keep it in your pants
this is a whole lot of weird before coffee
oh i have to go to the bathroom so bad
every year i told you wear a diaper
and i told you i get diaper rash
well this is it this is it this is it
it’s live go go go go go
do not stop refreshing your screens
yeah this is not gonna be enough coffee
it’s been ten minutes we’re running out of time
i did it i did it i’m in the queue
yay and they say firefighters are the real heroes
uh what number in line are you
oh they only have thursday and sunday passes left
oh thursday’s gone just sunday left
oh sunday’s the worst everybody’s leaving most of the good panels are over and the only tshirts they have left are small and xxxxl
so that’s it everything’s sold out
i can’t believe we’re not going
it’s okay you know there there’s always wondercon in anaheim you know that that’s just as good excuse me
oh guys this is really sad and in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago
i can’t believe we wasted all that time on our hulk costumes
what you were all going as the hulk
not the same hulk ferrigno bana norton and ruffalo
we would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball
and we’re back to the first kind of sad
gentlemen i have the solution to our comiccon problem we don’t need them i’m starting my own convention
sheldon just buy scalped tickets with us
i told you buying scalped tickets is against the rules if you get caught you get banned from comiccon for life life leonard you’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days
do what you want we’re getting scalped tickets
i already found a guy online who’s willing to sell
how do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the comiccon police
the same way i know that the people in the tv set can’t see me
sheldon just come with us you’re not gonna make your own convention
you know there was a time when comiccon didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen and you mark my words i’m gonna rip that guy off
yes i’m starting my own comic book convention and i thought that your client robert downey jr would be perfect to appear on our first panel oh well now why are you saying no you haven’t even asked him yet you know excuse me but i sat through iron man 2 i believe he owes me two hours of his time they hung up on me
did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a marie callender’s and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie
i didn’t even get to that part
look even your friend wil wheaton thinks this is a waste of time
not true wil thinks this is a great idea he was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event also that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard
sheldon buddy i just don’t think this is going to come together for you
you don’t know that i still have plenty of solid leads on this list
no wait i need you to call stan lee leonard nimoy and bill nye the science guy ’cause legally i’m not allowed to oh and also carrie fisher you know ’cause i hear he can be pretty nuts
i can’t believe leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets
last week you spent that on a little dress
yeah but those tickets only get him into comiccon that dress gets me into anywhere i want
those tickets were pretty expensive i had to give howie an advance on his allowance now he’s never gonna put his toys away
why can’t they do something sensible like sheldon and start their own comic book convention also who wants to throw me out that window
well while they’re acting like teenagers we could do something grownup
oh you mean like a museum
yes like a museum but anything else
oh i know there’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea
ooh afternoon tea how sophisticated of us
oh all right if we’re gonna be fancy i should probably put on clean underwear
ladeeda look who has clean underwear
no we’re gonna stop at target on the way
hey since sheldon’s not going to comiccon maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as
mmm what if we go as the fantastic four and just tell people that the invisible girl is standing there with us
oh and i thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over
gentlemen i am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention
does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape
i don’t think that will be necessary for mr james earl jones you heard me the voice of darth vader the lion king’s dad and fyi the guy who says this is cnn which also sounds like darth vader
how are you gonna get james earl jones
simple earlier today he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner i googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant that’s where he’ll be and that’s where i’m going and…
and that’s where darth vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head
sheldon i don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy you’re gonna get in trouble
you’re the ones who are going to get in trouble you’re buying nontransferable tickets and from a stranger no less not only can you get banned from comiccon if caught you could be charged with petty theft you think about that while i’m warning james earl jones about the danger of posting his location on twitter he got lucky this time there are some weirdoes out there to the imperial march theme bom bom bom bom badum bom badum bom bom bom bom badum bom badum bom bom badala baba badalum bom badala bom bom forgot my keys bom bom bom bom badum bom badum…
okay great bye our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late
does he sound like a criminal
you know did he say things like youse guys or listen here see
yes he he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940
i’m just saying we don’t know who this guy is what if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys or make a suit outof our skins
why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin
i don’t know maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains
well now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location
why do you think i told him to come to your place
there sure are a lot of little kids here
i can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up
i can’t believe the waiter thought i was your daughter
well last time i got dressed up and had tea was when i was five just me my teddy bear raggedy ann and my hamster
it was till my hamster ate all her babies it got less cute really fast
well there’s a bar in the lobby
i could go for a drink
aw drinking in the afternoon just like her mommy
thank you my friend leonard said if i bothered you while you were eating you’d think i was a creepy stalker
he is mr earl jones he is
okay so i’m on a comiccon message board and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge and sheldon was right he did get charged with petty theft guys if i go to jail dressed as the human torch that might send the wrong message
maybe this isn’t a good idea
i can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds
okay we’re officially not going to comiccon
hold on we always do this
chicken out we’re we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong
that’s ’cause we’re the good guys
you know i struggle with batman
i say this one time instead of wimping out let’s be badasses
okay i’ll be a badass but only if you pinkyswear to be one too
no need i’m breaking rules all the time
last night drank my pepto straight out of the bottle
what about that little cup they give you
you know when i first read the script for empire strikes back and darth vader told luke he was his father i thought for sure he was lying
me too but he wasn’t was he
he was not how messed up was that
what do you say let’s go have some fun my wife’s in new york and i got a lion king residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket
so afternoon tea was a bust
on the bright side every sixyearold there was jealous of my tiara not gonna lie it felt good
let me ask you a question when did you guys start feeling grown up ‘cause i am not sure i do
honestly i thought when i got married i would but i still kind of feel like i’m pretending it doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from gap kids
okay so i’m an adult and the other day i saw an old man slip and fall down and i laughed i mean i laughed hard like like out loud if he was conscious he would’ve heard me
i know one of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head i mean i i almost wet myself i guess you had to be there
i think i have you both beat imagine trying to feel like a grownup when you’ve never even been with a man
okay sex is not what makes you a grownup
yeah or you’d be the oldest one here
really is that how you talk to your mother
he just parked he’s on his way up
yeah what if we do get caught who cares so we get banned from comiccon
oh no i’d be an astronaut and a bad boy how will women keep their pants on
uh maybe it’ll come up when i apply for citizenship oh crap what if it comes up when i apply for citizenship
i wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants
he’s gonna be here any second what should we do
okay you guys are such babies i’ll handle this if he thinks we’re not home he’ll go away
i thought you were a badass
i lied about the pepto i always use the little cup
is it true as a child you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years
oh is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of darth vader breathing
oh is it true that you were premed in college and you almost became a doctor
oh james i could listen to your stories all night
i mean really what’s so great about being grown up
well for starters we’d be splitting this check three ways
i’m serious who wants to do all that stuff have insurance pay mortgages leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car
i told you it was penny
oh come on it wasn’t me anyone could have knocked your mirror off or whatever happened
maybe the guys are right i mean we spent the whole night trying to be mature and it was kind of boring i’m sure they’re having more fun than we are
oh god i could really use exactly two tablespoons of pepto right now
hey los angeles i’m on a ferris wheel with darth vader and he’s nicer than you think
in the jungle the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight…
bring it home mufasa eee eee eee eee eee um umaweh
i don’t understand what we’re doing
carrie fisher and she’s a little crazy so get ready to run rings doorbell
ah sheldon this is the perfect end to a perfect night
okay but i think it could have ended with the karaoke
what were you trying to ask me at the strip club
oh how much does it cost to get them off my lap
oh right well my friends and i couldn’t get into comiccon this year and i was trying to start my own convention and i was going to ask if you would be a panelist
why don’t you and your friends come to comiccon with me
of course and san diego is right across the border from my favorite city on earth tijuana where i’m taking you every night
so beau bridges is on my shoulders and jeff bridges is on marlon brando’s shoulders and remember we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey sheldon wake up and angie dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us and i go under the water and marlon goes under the water and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio and the dogs freak out and run like hell and then we run like hell oh boy that was a lot of fun
item 28 your pet name for me time’s running out on this you need to make a decision
i submitted you a notarised list
i’m sorry but gollum and flakey are not acceptable
well you don’t like princess corncob you don’t like fester you’re just impossible to please
we’ll come back to that one this brings us to the final item in our annual state of the relationship summit item 29 valentine’s day
ah the worst for last hmm classic flakey
before you get upset i believe i’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy
people usually start a meeting with a joke but you go ahead end with one
i propose we spend a weekend at a bedandbreakfast in napa valley
i hate every word in that sentence including in at we and a
for starters a bedandbreakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table
one step ahead of you bernadette and wolowitz are going with us
oh very well what are the sleeping arrangements we’ve only been dating for three years if we were to share a room people might talk
i got you your own room
what if my room has a clawfoot bathtub
it doesn’t i know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster
look i appreciate the effort but i’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me
we’re going to have valentine’s day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train
an alcoa fa4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 pullman firstclass coaches
wow i’m feeling the urge to hug you and one and two all right gollum we’re good
are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to napa you could probably still get a room
no i think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home
plus i’m not sure it’s a great idea to take penny to where wine comes from what it’s a joke oh come on we bust on each other i wear dorky glasses you might have a problem it’s all for laughs
that would really piss me off if i didn’t have a buzz going on
howard which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train
oh i’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch it will be embarrassing
i don’t own a pocket watch
oh my well then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot
since you two are gonna be around for valentine’s would you mind watching cinnamon
you have valentine’s plans which came out sounding way more surprised than i meant here let me try that again you have valent… see i can’t do it
i don’t have plans which is why i booked time on the big telescope that night
well an evening looking at the stars that’s still kind of romantic
i’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here work with me
we’d be happy to watch cinnamon
thank you oh and i’d like for at least one of us to see some action so if you guys happen to have sex it’s cool if she stays in the room
hey same goes for the two of you with amy
it’s magnificent this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever
i’m so glad you like it
i’m prepared to say i love it as soon as i confirm there are no hobos aboard
okay raj i got it bye to cinnamon that was your daddy he wanted me to say that he misses… why am i doing this
ooh flowers and chocolates somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties
don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out it came that way when i bought it
got you a little something too
aw jewellery oh my god lakers tickets
it gets better instead of me you can take someone who will actually enjoy it
aw you are the best boyfriend ever
thank you seriously please don’t make me go
should we take this little party to the bedroom
mm don’t have to we have the whole place to ourselves
in fact if you want we can do it right here on sheldon’s spot
that is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me
and for the entrée tonight’s special is a seafood risotto do you have any questions
uh i do uh does this train car have the original linkandpin coupler or the miller hook and platform
i’m sorry i meant questions about the food
oh of course um is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original linkandpin coupler or the miller hook and platform
uh i think we’re gonna need a minute
fun fact i’m gonna jump off this train
hey cinnamon guess who just did it human style
it’s a little late but i’ll take it
no cinnamon ate the chocolates that’s really bad for dogs
oh crap what are we gonna do
we gotta get her to a vet right now
i don’t have a vet i have a podiatrist an optometrist an allergist a dermatologist a urologist you’d think i’d have a vet
okay there’s one not far from here come on let’s go
okay koothrappali was right we should have let her watch
do another one do another one
okay here’s my impression of the amtrak acela barreling down the eastern corridor wchwchwchwchshhhh wchwchwchwchshhhh wchwchwchwchshhhh
it’s like there’s a train in your mouth howard
i’ve been on that train and i just was again
see if you guys can guess this one bang splat thud
how many trains have you been on
tons a box fell on my head at ups six years ago now i just collect disability and ride trains
not always a box fell on my head at ups six years ago now i just collect disability and ride trains
i’m gonna fix this right now
okay just make it look like an accident
excuse me you are at valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend now get back over there and be with her
you’re right that was insensitive of me i have to go back to my table now you should join us
great now there’s two of ’em
well to be fair you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me
so the point is i may have saved her life
i’m sorry is this a joke to you
how big a box of chocolate was it
uh something like this i don’t know it came free with a full tank of gas
really do you know how much those lakers tickets were
do you know how much gas is
oh my god cinnamon are you okay i can’t believe you two you do whatever it takes to save her life if she needs new organs i’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts
owner father soul mate and if anything happens to her your worst nightmare
well she’s not throwing up which is a good sign so i’m gonna take her in back put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins
okay okay thank you oh if she’s scared you can sing to her she likes katy perry oh but don’t do firework that gets her all riled up
got it should have been a dentist
okay what was the best fourtenfour us locomotive ever built
trick question there never was one
in 1944 the pacific railroad built number 6131 which rearranged the drivers and cylinders solving the problem of the q1 creating a duplexdrive fourfoursixfour
in what world is a fourfoursixfour a fourtenfour
a world i don’t want to live in seriously i no longer want to live in this world
hold on to your conductor’s hat you crank the second and third axles creating a pair of internal connecting rods and boom fourtenfour if you think about it the q2 was like the fourtenfour america never made
i may never stop thinking about it amy what are the odds we run into this guy
you know if you ask nicely they’ll let you visit the engine room
i never want this day to end
it’s feeling like it never will
hey did i tell you what happened to me at ups
as if valentine’s day wasn’t bad enough you try to kill my dog and with cheap chocolate no less
it wasn’t cheap it was free
we’re really sorry it was an accident
yeah we weren’t even out of the room that long
oh no come on it was a while it was a while
oh is cinnamon gonna be okay
she’s responding well we just want to keep her a little longer for observation
all right uh would would it be okay for me to see her we’re usually in bed by now and i want her to know that i’m here yes we sleep together and sometimes we spoon
it’s okay i sleep with my dog too we’re not supposed to let people in back but i think i can make an exception
come on by the way i sang her katy perry
and i don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says i crushed it
i think there’s something going on between the two of them
maybe but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while so what do you know
why because my boyfriend’s off playing choochoo with some weirdo
well to be fair they’re both weirdos
i don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different
well just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot to be honest i bet howie 200
i’m going to the lego store to get a bigass r2d2
see it’s not just sheldon they’re all idiots
so your boyfriend’s a fixerupper most of them are i mean look at this guy you think he came like this when i met him he was a hot goofy mess now he’s been to space that’s all me
i had a little to do with it
oh sure you did who’s mama’s big space man
they’ve been in there like half an hour
yeah for future reference that’s a while
i don’t know i’m kind of hungry
i saw a thai place next door
she’s gonna be okay they’re gonna let me take her home
so i want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours here are a few warning signs to look out for and if you see any of them don’t hesitate to call
oh thank you for taking such good care of my little girl
my pleasure have a nice night
yes thank you for all your help
yeah i’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously we love animals
oh do you guys own any pets
you guys missed a pretty great time
the conductor and i have the same pocket watch
dare i say loco oh and amy guess what the conductor said as soon as he gets off work he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us
okay i need to speak to my boyfriend in private like right now
there’s a car with a glass roof want to go look at the stars
excuse me i think you’re being a little rude
i’m being rude you’ve been rude to me this entire evening
how is that possible i’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train
i’m detecting a little friction between you two and i don’t want to be a third rail get it
it’s valentine’s day we’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend
oh really because i remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy did you mean that or were you just trying to trick me
fine it’s true i deserve romance and i didn’t know how else to make it happen
well if you want romance then let’s have romance oh look there’s wine mmm grape juice that burns uh now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes hmm you blinked i win
let’s see what’s next oh kissing’s romantic
good um the conductor said if i come back to the engine room he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing
do you want to come with me
there you go all cozy wozy here let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for hmm rajesh i was dreading valentine’s day thank you for spending it with me yvette cinnamon sheshe gave me her phone number if i’d known it was that easy i would have considered poisoning you months ago oh what should i say oh i know i’ll point out her name’s yvette and that she’s a vet that’s hysterical she’ll love it
oh hey you’re back how was your trip
i made a new friend who likes trains as much as i do uh i kissed amy on the lips and uh the conductor played his banjo for me good night
wait wait wait wait wait wait i’m gonna need more details
oh well my new friend’s name was eric um amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert oh and the banjoplaying conductor was missing a finger but he made up for it with his cando attitude
no hang on hang on are all those things equal to you
hmm it never occurred to me to pick a favourite
i can’t answer that without collecting additional data
i’m not sure how listening to other ninefingered banjo players makes me dog but all right
i’m thinking about growing a goatee
oh actually that’s a van dyke a goatee is just hair on the chin
oh wait then what is it if you just have hair up here
haha very funny make fun of the foreign guy for your information there are four times as many indians as there are americans so the way we say it is right
yeah she’s right you’re grown men the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moostaches
hey you were funny on purpose good job
hi sorry i’m late i was at an audition
how about instead of assuming i failed you ask me how it went
here you can have your seat
no no no stay there i’m fine on the floor
have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table
yeah you actually do have room for one up there
oh sure i sit on the floor for years no one cares the pretty white girl’s there ten seconds and suddenly we’re all running to ikea
no one is running anywhere we’re not getting a dining room table
i know you don’t like change but it’s not a terrible idea
yeah you guys never use that space up there why not get a table
do you want the long answer or the short answer
hey how come we never get that option
chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system if the equations describing its behaviour are nonlinear a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result
waah i don’t want a table
hey penny and i are gonna go shop for a dining room table you want to come with us
you know i’d love to but um i’m too busy falling back in love with windows 98
seriously you haven’t used this desk in years the second i want to get rid of it you’re up here working
i can’t talk right now i have several thousand updates to install
are you really gonna sit here all day
think of me as arthur dent in hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home
if you’ll recall the vogon fleet blew up the earth anyway
it’s a madeup story leonard i don’t even know why you’re talking about it
i’m putting all this stuff in storage we don’t need any of it
you how can you say that you show me one thing in here we can live without
oh hang on check your inbox
wait is this really worth it we’ve lived together for years with nary an argument
but we start talking about a table and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats
well that means not one or not any maybe instead of a table you should buy a dictionary well i don’t know if i won that but at least he’s upset
yeah i can control all sorts of stuff
did bernadette think it was cool
not when i said mute and pointed it at her face
oh uh let me try uh channelis changeroni this might be my second favorite brown magic wand
well that’s the last time i play with that phone rings i have to take this hello 00
uh off and on and the oprah network this is so much better than watching tv like a muggle
okay thank you we’ll be in touch you’re not gonna believe this
what’s going on oh wait on and off what’s going on
that was nasa they want me to go back up to the space station
wow what did you tell them
i told them i’d be honoured
a second trip to space i’ll miss you
and i’m gonna miss you too
and i just want you to know i’m happy to look in on bernadette while you’re gone
and if anything were to happen to you we will name our first born son howard i’m just kidding we’ll name him dalib after my grandfather
no sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood
he’s afraid the original owners will come back
well he is here so unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller there’s nothing i can do about it
all right sweetie you’re paying for this table and it’s your apartment too
no buts you got to stop letting him boss you around
you’re right i mean he decides what tv shows we watch what food we eat who my favourite hobbit is i wanted frodo but we can’t both have frodo so guess who’s stuck with samwise gamgee
see right there you’re a grown man you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want wish you wouldn’t but one problem at a time
you make a lot of sense i like this table and i’m getting it
that one damn right i like that one
good news someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket
fine can i at least shower first
no not that although you already agreed to it so no takebacks
sit down nasa called the telescope mount i installed on the space station got damaged and they want me to go back up and fix it
wow well what did you say
what do you think i said i said yes why do you look surprised
well it’s just after last time i didn’t think you’d ever want to go back
are you kidding it was the greatest experience of my life
really ‘cause i kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over
i think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower
hey all set what do you think there’s plenty of room for everybody a view out the window
my spot on the couch has a great view of a window sometimes i can see space battles through it it’s called a tv
give it a chance sheldon you might actually like it
well you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot
so when can we get rid of it
what about the roommate agreement it specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the furnishing committee which only sits on alternate years yeah and by the way it sits over there
she’s right a committee that important should meet more often
oh this is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life
okay i think we’ve found the problem here it’s not the table at all it’s you
well it’s always me take one for the team
i have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will and then you came along and reshaped him with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals
are you gonna let him talk to me like this
okay i have not tried to change leonard that’s just what happens in relationships look how much amy’s changed you
oh please when i first met you you were incapable of touching another human being now you’re holding hands you’re going on dates you even made out with her on a train
of course she told me it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life
you’re too close to it but amy has had a huge impact on you
you’re right without realizing it i’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality
mm sheldon you didn’t have a personality you just had some shows you liked
no no i’ve changed like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death
or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince
or you’re just a tall annoying frog
excuse me i have to break up with my girlfriend
no you’ve opened my eyes to the truth amy has made me a more affectionate openminded person and that stops now
yeah mmhmm amy it’s penny hey just a little headsup leonard bought a dining room table yeah sheldon’s breaking up with you
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy i’ll get right to the point i think we need to end this relationship so just sign this with your finger and uh please don’t cry on my ipad i didn’t get applecare
i’m not surprised you want to end the relationship i’m a little surprised you didn’t get applecare anyway enjoy your life where do i sign
at the bottom i must say i’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this
oh i’ve already moved on besides this breakup has nothing to do with me
of course not this is just leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship he’s manipulating you like he always does
wait wait now hang on you think he manipulates me
all the time and he knew that as your girlfriend i wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment i mean a table come on
well thankfully i won’t have to see it ’cause i won’t be your girlfriend anymore amy farrah fowler why yes i would like to take a survey
wait you were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table
wait how do i know that you’re not manipulating me right now
i think if i were manipulating you you’d be smart enough to see it
how do i know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation
i think you’d be smart enough to see that too
okay i’m sorry i gave you such a hard time i just had to be sure
it’s pretty exciting that nasa wants to send howard back up
yeah exciting can i ask you something
he hated that entire experience does it make me an awful wife if i don’t think he should do it again
not at all he’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there it’s like me in those moments when i miss india
well i’m his wife i don’t want to ruin it for him
that’s the dynamic i’m the fun one you’re the buzzkill
since when am i the buzzkill
do you think this is cool
oh hey you guys didn’t break up
no sorry to disappoint you but amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me
which you also figured out by yourself
which i also figured out by myself
well i’m glad you’re still together
yeah okay you can stop trying to make this about our relationship
which is stronger than ever this is about you trying to change my environment which was perfect the way it was
but it got the way it was through change thethethe spot that you love to sit in that no one else can sit in only exists because despite your objections i bought this couch me so explain why that change was bad and this change was good
you don’t need to explain yourself to him
i don’t need to explain myself to you
you’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me
keep the table we don’t use that space
maybe you should have a seat
um okay i know my mom’s not dead there’d be balloons
um okay first off know that we all love you and cherish you
well i heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station and as someone who’s been there with you well you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff
the stuff you have is wrong
you don’t think i did a good job up there
you did a fine job it’s just you were scared and miserable the whole time
i think what we’re all trying to say is you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you
like how women often forget the pain of childbirth
fine maybe i was a little scared
you peed in your space suit
son do i need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time
hang on that was just me joking around
you wanted me to shoot you in the foot
come on how is that not a joke you got to get me out of this shoot me in the foot
don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you
and how you threw up in zero gravity and it floated back in your mouth and you threw up again and so on and so on
okay so i wasn’t exactly john glenn up there but i’ve changed i’m a different man now yeah and i’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think i can handle it
you know you’re gonna have to go through survival training again
you’ve got to get me out of this
what do you want me to do you’re perfectly healthy
check my blood pressure again i can get it higher just give me a second dials phone
how i am is not dead but you wouldn’t know that because you don’t love me enough to pick up the phone
for all you know i could have slipped in the tub and drowned that’s what happened to your aunt ida
howard i’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts
oh me too i mean the doctor was willing to fudge the results but it just seemed so darned dishonest
but the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
look my blood pressure’s too high okay drop it
you know my aunt changed her diet and in a few months she…
went to space i don’t think so now pass the soy sauce hey not the green one the red one
sheldon amy will you please come join us
so why are you trying to ruin it
no thanks we’re fine i mean if you people want to eat at the table then that’s what you should do i like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things but if those days are gone they’re gone it just makes me sad
oh don’t anthropomorphize him he’s got big eyes but his feelings are not like ours
no it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups
well it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big evil baby
look at amy down there should we go
but penny this was your idea you said that i should stand up to him
screw that i sat on the floor for seven years i’m staying right here
come on raj it’s not the same without you
fine but no more making fun of how i say tings
well isn’t this nice sometimes the baby wins
thank you that was the closest i’ve come to sex in like two years
now i feel a little gross
you’re only making it seem more real for me
hey that’s my wife if anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex it’s me
can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life
how about penny’s depressing acting career
hey i mean it’s been a little tough but penny’s following her dreams and in my book that is not depressing
is that book called lies i tell to get sex
is that a real book i would totally read that book
can i borrow it when you’re done
well i’ll have you guys know i turned down a part in a movie last week
because it was crap it’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie i was in
serial apeist i thought you died in that
while showering topless 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters
i have an eidetic memory i don’t know what his problem is
okay well there are no shower scenes in this one they just try to clone me from my corpse but my dna gets mixed with the ape’s dna and i end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet
am i missing something or isn’t that the part she was born to play
so are you really not gonna do this movie
well i don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career
well but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies
okay i don’t think meryl streep ever had to say “must keep gorilla hands from killing again”
if she did it would be amazing that woman can do no wrong
i don’t know anything about show business so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings i’m sure you know what you’re doing
are you sure we were making fun of failed careers we didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is howard’s
hey i work at the same university you do
yes and hawkeye’s in the avengers but no one ever says help hawkeye
can i ask you something why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband
oh i’m sure he does it out of love the same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices
no no no this is not a fight i was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it now it’s a fight
well with that sorted out i’m happy to answer your question bernadette howard started it
i didn’t do anything i was just sitting here
i wasn’t referring to this evening ten years ago upon first seeing me your husband claimed that i looked like c3po and peewee herman and he called me c3pwee herman
nine years 11 months and three weeks ago he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over
the lecture was on cosmic gas clouds that’s funny
i was there it was funny
in any event that began a decadelong progression of insults pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions to this day i still get a monthly copy of granny on granny which other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page is complete filth
thanks for walking me to my car
actually it’s for both of us last night i watched west side story and i’m a little freaked out by street gangs
why can’t raj find a girl the mystery continues
i don’t appreciate your sarcasm but we’ve still got two blocks to go so i’ll put up with it
whatever happened with your online dating
no one was writing me back so i stopped checking my profile
before i met sheldon i was ready to give up too once i even dropped in on my obgyn just to get some human contact
it has been a while since i got my prostate checked
then i met sheldon and look at where we are now
what you’ve kissed like once in three years
that’s true do whatever you want
listen i was thinking you and i could probably try to be better friends
really i was thinking what we have now is a bit much
seriously i was talking to bernadette last night and she made some great points you and i have known each other a long time and i didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off
very well how do you propose we move forward
uh for starters we could stop insulting each other
that’s a great idea and in the spirit of our new arrangement i will mask my surprise that you came up with it
anyway i got invited to do a little talk at nasa in houston this weekend they gave me two tickets bernadette can’t go you want to come with me you can visit your mom and i’ll show you around the space centre
i have one question is this a prank where we land in houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a spanish name and then i get arrested and deported to south america
i’m glad because i would not have seen that coming
amy i could use some help
oh let me guess there’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain
i thought about what you said last night and i went back on the dating web site and i was looking at this girl’s profile she’s amazing
oh she’s cute and smart phi beta kappa
and judging by her lack of adam’s apple she’s been female her entire life i like that in a woman
great so what do you need me for
well i was up all night trying to write to her but i wanted to run it by you first
emily your face is like a precious dewkissed flower
no you’re supposed to be yourself not all desperate and creepy
okay i’m getting some mixed messages here
just say something normal like i saw your profile looks like we have a lot in common let’s get a cup of coffee sometime”
yes where i can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips or you just write it for me
i’m not gonna pretend to be you
i don’t want you to pretend to be me you can be like my uh online wingman like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up
well what would i say to her
just tell her what i’m really like and if you think it’ll help that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar use your own words
thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy
oh it’s no problem is everything okay
oh i’m fine it’s just some uh stomach medication for my trip there’s the remote yet distinct possibility that i may end up in south america
remember the old days when i would’ve said something dumb like why uh that doesn’t sound good
remember the old days when i used to point out that your check engine light was on
well get ready to stroll down memory lane penny your check engine…
yeah i know it’s on sheldon oh no no no no no i cannot afford this right now
maybe it’s just something minor ooh good news the light just went out
are we playing individual or teams
oh in that case i’d like to be partnered with my good friend howard
but i’m always on howard’s team we’re best friends the kind who finish each others…
i really don’t think we do tha…
oh how’d it go at the mechanic
not great can i talk to you for a sec
maybe i can go with you guys to houston
isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…
i don’t know what to do my car threw a rod and it’s totaled i can’t afford a new one i have no job and now i can’t drive to auditions
i’m so sorry i know it’s a sensitive subject but can you reconsider that part in the movie
i did i called them the part’s gone they gave it to someone else now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her
at least they talked about you on letterman come on i can drive you wherever you need to go
how unlike me you have a job i’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress like i will be for the rest of my life
leonard would you wrap it up we’re waiting on you
i’m sorry is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game
it is you were wrong friend howard she completely understood
have you heard back from emily
and i’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her
i give you one simple thing to do contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me and you blow it
i told her what a good guy you are but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself she thought it made you seem too shy and passive
i’m not too shy and passive you write her back and tell her i said that you know when you have a second
look i’ll see if i can change her mind tomorrow night
well we just we emailed back and forth a bit and we kind of hit it off
i find a girl i like and you’re stealing her
no we just ended up having a lot in common we went to harvard we like chaucer we’re both hardcore into quilting
your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart
that’s sheldon he says he’ll be down in a minute
oh he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car
this is gonna be a long weekend for you
you’re the reason i’m doing it
i said to stop insulting each other i didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway
how do i know what you said damn you and your noisecancelling breasts
it’s not every day you get to tour nasa with a real astronaut
tap tap tap howard tap tap tap howard tap tap tap howard
i have to go to the bathroom
you just went to the bathroom
but i didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe despite all my emails the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt
i realize that but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago
i’m trying to be a better friend but you constantly say and do irritating things
when how about in the car i’m an astronaut and you know it you just don’t like admitting it because you’re jealous
well truth be told as a child i did dream of going to space those astronauts were my heroes and when you got to go it was hard for me
because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there aren’t you going to let me out
but i still need to use the bathroom
here you go be creative what’s the matter scared of a little turbulence
no turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere i’m not scared at all oh apple juice stay where you are
oh this is nothing i experienced way worse when i was plummeting back to earth apparently not being a real astronaut okay that was a big one
i take it back i’m scared of turbulence
i’m gonna need that bag back
you sure you want to do this
yeah why wouldn’t i want to get my old job back it’ll be fun to see everyone i haven’t talked to them since i said i quit see you at the oscars bitches come on let’s just get this over with
let’s get this over with am i driving you to the cheesecake factory or are we having sex i’m just i’m trying to lighten the mood
so humiliating am i driving you to the cheesecake factory… i’m sorry i’ll i’ll stop i’ll stop
come on don’t look so sad you never know what’s gonna happen maybe tonight will be great
sweetie i know you’re trying to make me feel better and i love you for that but it’s making me feel worse and i kind of hate you this isn’t your car
i know i thought we’d take yours
it’s nothing fancy but it’ll get you to auditions and at least for now you don’t have to go back to waitressing
i don’t know what to say
i mean you could say thank you i did just buy you a car
look i admit that it’s odd that rajesh didn’t write to you himself but if you get to know him you’ll see he’s just a sweet regular guy as a counterpoint here he is uninvited and visibly sweaty
amy told me you were concerned that i might be too passive and shy let me ask you something would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say hey dewkissed flower what’s up
no but a weird guy with no boundaries might
uh okay that’s a separate issue let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing
are we still going to go to that chaucer reading friday
you know i think i’m just gonna go by myself
not my best first date yeah but not my worst either
i’m sorry for every mean thing i ever did or said to you
i’m sorry too it’s all my fault
if you weren’t my friend there’d be a hole in my life
kind of like when firefly was cancelled but not as big
should we stop holding hands now
should you really be sitting in sheldon’s spot
he’s in texas he’ll never know
i wouldn’t be so sure about that
yeah he has a very sensitive butt well it’s true once i saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up
i did his talk at nasa went great
no in fact he was so wellbehaved howie bought him a buzz aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream
good sheldon’s out of town so we can do whatever we want we even ordered from the thai place he doesn’t like
what do you guys want to do tonight
well i told howie if i wasn’t busy i’d spend the night at his mom’s so for god’s sake think of something
oh my god you guys need to do something
what do you mean it’s too late
he’s been murdered by someone in this room
welcome to another classic koothrappali murder mystery dinner
you can’t leave you’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of stuart bloom
i didn’t know his last name was bloom
are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night
what do you think i was gonna do at home
are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents
lame characters with silly ac… what kind of actress are you
you’re right i’m sorry sounds like fun
that kind of actress this sucks
come on guys raj put a lot of effort into this and that’s great it’s not sad it’s great
i think it might be fun to be someone else tonight
actually you’re all just gonna be yourselves
all right if i’m doing this i’m playing to win so just to be clear if we’re ourselves that means one of us killed stuart
very good bernadette you are a regular byomkesh bakshi
what is that like the indian sherlock holmes
or is sherlock holmes the english byomkesh bakshi
according to wikipedia sherlock holmes came first
great everyone’s a byomkesh bakshi now here are some secret facts about each of you including whether you are the murderer throughout the game feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues
got it hey who’s the murderer
sorry hey who’s not the murderer
bernadette can you not stand so close to me
what do you care you’re dead
suit yourself but i can kind of see up your skirt
thank you for my bobble head
thank you for not making fun of me during my speech
it wasn’t easy was it buzz
we can’t show up to your mom’s emptyhanded we should bring something
i already am i’m bringing the gift of knowledge
despite what her bible says recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the old testament they didn’t exist in the middle east until hundreds of years later
i was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie but an insult to her faith is always thoughtful
i can’t tell you that but perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment
ooh i’m gonna check the fridge and see if there are any clues inside a beer
hey i found something it looks like a little man with a briefcase
oh no no that’s clarence darrow it’s from a game sheldon made up called chutes and lawyers you slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system
well unlike that my games are much more fun
okay can i ask you something why do you like making us do this stuff
well i guess it goes back to when i was a fat kid in india and didn’t have any friends
i didn’t know you were fat
yeah i was i was 200 pounds by the time i was in middle school kids were mean cows may be sacred there but it doesn’t help if you look like one anyway i was pretty lonely so i had to make up my own stories and games and i promised myself if i ever made any friends that that i would play those games with them
i’ve seen old pictures of you you were never a fat kid
no i was svelte as a gazelle a gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling
hey what about this it looks like a receipt
for a cup of coffee but it’s dated 20 years from now
from the future how fun and imaginative
so one of us came back from the future to murder stuart
does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off terminator
does the smartass know that terminator was actually ripped off from an outer limits script called demon with a glass hand by harlan ellison
oh does the gazelle know that according to harlan ellison it was not ripped off from demon with a glass hand but was ripped off from another outer limits script he wrote called the soldier
okay give me the flowers and pie
but if we show up and you’re holding them she’ll think they’re only from you
they are only from me you said the gift of you was enough
yes but now that i’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like there’s no going back boy i can’t wait to see the look on her face we’re leaving right now
what sheldon tell me what’s going on
i saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again
you ready to talk about it
i’m not nearly drunk enough okay do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone
does a brisket count i’m sorry buddy that’s rough but didn’t she know we were coming
no i wanted to surprise her what am i supposed to say to her after something like this
well did she see you in the window
i have to how can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if i don’t tell her how disappointed i am and that i’ll never forgive her
well don’t do it on the phone
no i’m just going to tell her i’m coming so she can give that good time charlie the heaveho
that’s some tough talk i may need to cut you off
yeah maybe you better i took a pretty big sip
look she’s a grown woman and and your dad’s been gone a long time maybe this is none of your business
i beg to differ i used to live in those genitals and if someone wants to move into my old room i should at least get a vote
okay murder suspects leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used you’re all inside it and we hurtle through the very fabric of time and welcome to 20 years in the future hey you guys just timetravelled stop looking so bored
well my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy so far the future’s great
hey can i go to the bathroom
fine just try not to look too alive
so one of us went back in time to kill stuart
perhaps this will help here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue
hey i won the nobel prize in physiology then i used the money to buy stuart’s comic book store and close it down so sheldon would pay attention to me not the worst idea
hey i’m a famous actress living in london
hmm i’m a professor at stanford
so i guess you two are making it work long distance
oh no in this game as your careers both took off you drifted apart kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after i became boy toy for the wrinkled but still flexible madonna
what does your card say bernadette
uh uh uh hang on do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful
of course not if i became a famous actress and had to move you would just come with me
but if i get a chance to be a tenured professor i might not have that much choice in where i end up
yeah but if i become a successful actress we wouldn’t need the money
well you don’t go into science for the money
speak for yourself last month my company both invented and cured restless eye syndrome kaching ya blinky chumps
so wait if my career took me somewhere else you might not go
dun dun dun he started it
okay okay guys new back stories uh penny and leonard you two lovebirds are super successful and living in new york uh you’re an actress you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids
really you think i’m putting this body through three kids
you aren’t you gonna come with me
while you confront your mother about her sex life i’d rather go back to that bar in assless chaps
knock knock knock mother knock knock knock mother knock knock knock mother
shelly i’m so glad you’re here
i saw you having naked sex
earlier i came here to surprise you i looked in the window and i saw you with a man
oh shelly i’m so sorry come in um maybe we should sit down and talk about this
can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on
that’s not funny maybe we should sit at the table well i’m sure that uh you have a lot of questions
his name is ron i met him at my prayer group
how long have you been involved with him
and of those few months how long have you been a demented sex pervert
that is no way to speak to your mother
perhaps not but it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the bible to me my whole life and then desecrates one of ethan allen’s finest sofas
i will give you one opportunity young man to apologize
or i will send you to your room
that’s ridiculous i am a grown man i am a professional scientist and i currently occupy the moral high ground
but i occupy the moral high ground
can we please get back to the game
in a minute i don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any i have in science
okay if you do something cool in science you might change the world if i become a famous actress i’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best they just are
i’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff
like you and sheldon have everything figured out
actually our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios including career changes financial instability intelligent dog uprising fyi we plan on selling out the human race hard
in 20 years who knows what’ll happen with any of us
i think you and leonard will be together
yeah i think you’re the best couple i know
ahdadadada let the dead man talk so why do you think that
uh well i feel like you guys make each other better penny brought leonard out of his shell and it seems like leonard makes penny think more deeply about the world i don’t know together you two kind of make one awesome person
aw stuart now i feel bad for murdering you
penny did it i win suck it jackasses
apparently any man is welcome in this house why not you i thought you were waiting in the car
that was an hour ago sheldon a jew sits in front of a house in texas that long for sale signs start to go up i take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom
no i’m not sure how we’re going to get past this
you know i i sort of went through something like this myself
howard we’ve all seen your mother naked that woman needs to learn how to tie a robe
i’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left
yeah she was dating this guy and i was kind of a jerk to her about it
well let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of temple beth el anyway she broke up with him and she’s basically been alone ever since she never said it but i always felt i was the reason why
i’m sorry although based on your story you absolutely were the reason why
all i’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness
you may have a point i love my mother even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel
hello are you ready to discuss this calmly like adults
shelly i’m sorry that you saw what you saw i know that this is hard for you
i think what most upsets me about it mother is the hypocrisy doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life
you’re right it does and it’s something that i’m struggling with these days
then why are you doing it
because i’m not perfect shelly and that man’s booty is
well this is confusing for me but i don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness so i’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance
that is very christian of you
mother if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion then i should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman you know it’s not all sock hops soda jerks and segregation anymore
how old do you think i am
my point is that you’re going to need to be careful you used to be protected by your preenlightenment mythology but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex
are you having the sex talk with me
no don’t look to him he’s mad at you right now
oh come on don’t pout i’m sorry i ruined your game
i’m not pouting i’m brooding which is how sexy men pout
it actually was kind of fun
i liked the time travel element
thank you i thought it was inspired
well i hope 20 years from now we really are all still together and still friends
of course well hey how about this whether we’re friends not friends scattered around the world no matter what let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8
putting it in my phone right now
my phone doesn’t have a calendar so i’ll just write it on my hand
all right i’ll see you guys in 20 years
boy do i have to urinate
if only there were a solution to that
seriously i feel like i’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis
because i’m trying to decide between getting an xbox one or a ps4 oh pee why’d i say that
forgive me for asking a stupid question but why are you being stupid
i’m not being stupid i’m employing the work of dutch researcher mirjam tuk who found that people with full bladders make better decisions
why did i pee before i decided to move in here
hey oh how’d the audition go
i killed it i was even able to cry real tears right on the spot
i know next time i get pulled over for a speeding ticket here come the waterworks
what is this my first day
can i get your opinion on something that happened at work today
okay well i did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell
i’m gonna go with monster what do you got
well there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign
but no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what i was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card
so on the card in the hospital next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words “hey vivian you deserve this and at least with you gone no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge”
“ps good luck wherever you wind up”
oh why didn’t i put money on this phone rings hey that’s my agent if i got the part it’s still the second best thing i’ve heard all day hello
no no it was a mistake
am i a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card
now i think you’re flirting with the line good news
i kind of did the part in that awful horror movie i passed on came back around apparently it’s mine if i want it
i don’t know what to do
maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die lol right
i i don’t know if you remember me
from the dating web site your friend emailed me because you were afraid to then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic
yes rajesh koothrappali look uh i just i wanted to say i’m sorry okay you were like the coolest person i ever found online and i got really nervous and i i just blew it
uh don’t worry about it and if it makes you feel any better you’re not the weirdest guy i’ve met off the internet
well give me a chance you don’t even know me
ah really thank you fate has given me a rare second chance and i swear to vishnu i’m not gonna blow it or normal words followed by a charming smile
so first there was playstation aka ps1 then ps2 ps3 and now ps4 and that makes sense you’d think after xbox there’d be xbox 2 but no next came xbox 360 hmm and now after 360 comes xbox one why one maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it
can you get the butter please
you know however with the xbox one i can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands up until now i’ve had to use leonard
then get the other one pass the butter
get hang on i don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously
fine sheldon you have my undivided attention
okay now the ps4 is more angular and sleeklooking
yeah well it’s true but the larger size of the xbox one may keep it from overheating
well you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat
no see well you absolutely would not and furthermore the xbox one now comes with a kinect included
yes not sold separately although the ps4 uses cool new gddr5 ram while the xbox one is still using the conventional ddr3 memory
why would they still be using ddr3 are they nuts
see that’s what i thought but then they go and throw in an esram buffer
whoa whoa wait a second who’s they
no i am not and this esram buffer should totally bridge the 100gigabitpersecond bandwidth gap between the two ram types
this is a nightmare how will you ever make a decision
okay it’s not me right this script is terrible
yeah i had higher hopes for a movie called serial apeist 2
okay reading sometimes i feel like i can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me but then i see these bananas and i just want to eat them and then kill people what am i gonna do
well for starters i wouldn’t eat the bananas
no come on this is serious
uh uh does it at least pay well
less than i was making at the cheesecake factory
she’s thinking of taking a job at the cheesecake factory
you know what why don’t you just do it you’ll go have fun for a few weeks make some money and who knows what it might lead to
okay look here page 58 i oilwrestle an orangutan in a bikini
just to clarify which one of you is wearing the bikini
uh it’s date night aren’t you uh forgetting something
oh of course they kiss did i mention the ps4 controllers light up
and then after coffee we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from india were exotic and mysterious so with my mouth i said we’re just like anybody else but with my eyes i said straight up red hop on my flying carpet
so are you gonna see her again
yeah we have plans this weekend and if it’s a clear night i’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her
i can’t do that to leonard this is some powerful pantydropping stuff
you have my blessing go for it
okay penny two of the brightest stars in the night sky are altair and vega and it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the milky way
it is but once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion
quick poll ps4 or xbox one raj
i just got an email from my exgirlfriend lucy she misses me and wants to get together
two women at the same time nice job playa
was it the two women thing or the playa it was the playa
what am i supposed to do how am i supposed to choose between emily and lucy
why do you have to choose date both of them
i can’t date two women at once zero women that’s my sweet spot
unless you’re sleeping with one of them seeing other people isn’t a big deal
but what if one of them asks me what i was up to the night before and i was with the other one then what do i lie
were you seeing other women when we started dating
no were you seeing other men
thank you so much for letting us pick your brain
yeah happy to help so what’s going on
well i’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground and i got offered a role in this crappy horror movie and i just don’t know if i should take it
well i have certainly taken some jobs that i’ve been embarrassed by
i wouldn’t exactly call star trek embarrassing
so what do you think is there a professional downside to doing it
well it’s tricky you want to take projects that you’re excited about but sometimes you also have to pay the bills when you’re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad not star trek
yeah beam me up i love it
anyway those jobs can be soulcrushing
so i was in stand by me when i was a kid and it was a huge success the terrible movies i did came after that i mean imagine how that feels
i’m telling you this business is brutal to this day i hate going on auditions okay i walk in and i can just feel them thinking he was such a cute kid what happened to him and then i don’t get the job and i can never find out why honestly i get so depressed there are entire weeks that i can’t even get out of bed
any news on your coworker who’s in the hospital
poor thing she was in surgery for 18 hours she’s alive but she’s still in critical condition
the one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card so you know silver linings
were you like this when i married you
don’t worry about it buddy okay bye that was wil he’s feeling a lot better apparently he’s 12down in the tv guide crossword puzzle
did he help you make a decision about the movie
no did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls
as a matter of fact i did i’ve spent so many years living in fear saying no to new experiences but from now on i’m gonna say yes yes to love yes to adventure yes to life whatever it may be the answer’s going to be yes
you know i’m proud of me too i’ve done all my research i conducted an informal poll and i’ve arrived at the rocksolid certainty i’ve made the right choice
well that’s got to be a good feeling
i had the same feeling when i made my dad buy a betamax instead of a vhs
you were just a little kid
yeah a little kid who picked the wrong format to record the macneillehrer report now i also was certain that hd dvd would win out over bluray
old enough to know better you know and now that i think about it i stood in front of a case of ipods and i bought a zune
yeah exactly it’s an mp3 player brought to us by the makers of xbox
no what are you doing no no pick that back up you know it’s good you did the research
you know what how about i buy it for you how about i buy you both
you know i only have one slot available in my entertainment centre
then i’ll buy you a new entertainment centre
well yeah okay sure but which one
how about this i’ve heard that if you flip a coin it will tell you how you actually feel because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome
so heads it’s ps4 tails it’s xbox one
could have given it back to me that was a choice
you look you look really pretty tonight
thank you thanks thanks i’m sorry i can’t do this my my exgirlfriend emailed me and i’m seeing her saturday and i’m glad you like it it’s from j crew
my friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time but it it feels like i’m being deceitful
are you getting back together with her
no i i have no idea what would you do
uh usually on first dates i talk about music and stuff but i was promised weird so let’s do this how serious were you two
well to be honest we only went on four dates hugged twice kissed once and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo
wait so a girl you never slept with sent you an email and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me
are you are you sure because this is the part of the night where i’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves
yeah but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you
we just met you don’t need to tell me about other people you’re seeing
really because i’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing i can say about myself
on the one hand the xbox one has a better camera but the ps4 has a removable hard drive thoughts
let’s get you some food you you’ll feel better after you eat
whatwhat do you want like thai food a burger
i don’t know hey look a quarter
great not like regret at all
i got to tell you the more i read about the primordial gravity wave discovery the more excited i get
i know being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star
what do you think about it sheldon
are you kidding me this may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime how can you as a theoretical physicist not care about this
maybe it’s because i’m not an elitist what i’d like to know is how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street you know who’s looking out for joe sixpack and all his quantum physics concerns
oh i don’t know maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven the higgs field just got proven and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started
yeah well i’ve had a lot on my plate we happen to live in a golden age of television
excuse me fewwas sowwy for eavesdwopping but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the hadwon cowwider
really did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry
no but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything
why would you do that you’re a string theorist as well
incowwect i am a stwing pwagmatist i say i’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved i appwy for gwant money and then i spend it on wiquor and bwoads water
do you think he’s right am i wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven
maybe but how great is game of thrones
i told you those walking dead pillowcases were a bad idea
all right i’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions i’ve got nothing to show for it and i feel like a fool
okay i get it i mean not all the jibberjabber in the middle but i know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it
your failed attempt to go back to college
no i’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship and i know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want
i said leonard you said no
okay well what do you do
you have to have the courage to end the relationship you know break it off shake hands walk away
i don’t know if i can do that
i know it’s hard honey but in the end that’s how you grow
penny have you seen my good inhaler
break it off shake hands walk away
hey how’s dating two women going
um kind of hit a bump when i was honest and told emily she wasn’t the only person i was seeing it went great so i tried the same thing with lucy
she had mixed feelings but when i said emily was cool with it emily’s the best why can’t you
women who knows what’ll set ’em off
at least now i can focus all my energies on just one girl
i hope i get to meet her as soon as possible
why the rush she isn’t going anywhere
she is but i like that attitude
gentlemen is anybody interested in my old string theory books
you’re really going to do this
i am yeah penny pointed out that what i’m going through is essentially a breakup and according to cosmopolitan magazine one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship
yes as it turns out there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue anyway it suggests that i set these on fire but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in east texas
oh that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic riemann surface
oh yeah wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship
it was this seemed so elegant at the time but now i realize i was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places
i know as hard as this is i have to move on i can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return i have needs too
so you and emily still together
i spoke to bernadette she’s free tomorrow night
oh okay great but if we’re really gonna do a double date then we have to go over some ground rules about emily
like when it turns out she’s made of rubber i don’t say anything
oh that’s what it says on the box right next to dishwasher safe
see this is exactly the kind of thing i’m worried about you saying in front of her
i promise i’ll be on my best behaviour
you better be no jokes about how close i am with my dog or the truth about how close i am with my dog
no jokes about the year i took ballet
are you sure you want to do this
the magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look
what about your old look wellgroomed ventriloquist doll
oh my god i do look like that
so how do you want me to cut it
oh how about bill gates meets nikola tesla
so business in the front science in the back
or i don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little
oh i’m in your hands do a good job and i’ll tell you cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your pms
can you keep him quiet maybe jangle some keys in front of him
that doesn’t work any more he just thinks i’m taking him to the doctor so now that you’re no longer invested in string theory what are you gonna pursue
oh there are so many exciting areas black holes dark matter
oh leonard was telling me about dark matter but i didn’t really understand it
don’t feel bad neither does he
have you ever even seen a picture of tesla
i suppose i could see myself in a scientific boy band of course i’d be the dreamy one and the smart one
sorry i’m late what did you do
i gave him a new look it’s cute huh
yeah it’s cute that’s the problem i don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick
me too i just hope he doesn’t blow it
because he’s raj that’s his thing beckham can bend it ralph can wreck it raj can blow it look i don’t want it to happen but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… oh crap i know that girl
in a bad way very bad
whatever you hear tonight just remember i love you hey
emily these are my good friends howard and bernadette guys this is emily
uh no i i don’t i don’t think so
well you sure don’t you i know you i know you total stranger even if you had yummy candy i would not get in your van
did you go to that spin class on green street
since when do you go to spin class
sheldon your food’s getting cold what are you doing
oh looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry why do we have a geology book leonard did you throw a children’s party while i was in texas
let me put this in a way you’ll understand penny you remember how you explained to me that the kardashians aren’t real celebrities well geology is the kardashians of science
have you considered studying standard model physics
you want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced you know why don’t you break up with penny and start dating a brown bear
like you could get a brown bear
hey i’ve got a good job i could buy salmon you don’t know
maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements
oh please if i wanted to take up a fad i’d get a tramp stamp
oh duchess look at me my quantum gravity’s positively loopy
one of the people that lives in his head
i hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me
well if he does i’ll see if my bear has a friend
sheldon have you ever considered not rushing into something new i mean why don’t you take your time enjoy your freedom maybe something new to study will find you
that’s actually not bad advice you know i didn’t seek out string theory it just hit me over the head one day
a bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find
okay how about we toast your newfound freedom
ah normally i refrain from alcohol but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus
and you wonder why other children beat you with books cheers
i’m a dermatology resident at huntington hospital
mmm and you know what that means someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever
this is making me crazy i know i know you from somewhere
oh uh howard was an astronaut maybe that’s where you saw him
wow that’s amazing what was that like
it was the most incredible experience of my life up there in the space station you’re…
can i finish my astronaut story
we were set up on a blind date
okay i’ll say it i was on the way to pick her up my stomach felt a little funny when i got there i asked if i could use her bathroom
one roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later i was so humiliated i snuck out the window and never saw her again
you know what else i never saw again my security deposit
i’m sorry i tried to unclog it but you didn’t have a plunger and water was spilling out everywhere
look i have felt terrible about this for years and i’m glad i have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry i am
it’s fine all my friends love this story they call you clogzilla
get it because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster
well hey it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you
come on let’s get you to bed you’ve had a lot to drink
wait wait wait wait wait knock knock knock empty room knock knock knock empty room knock knock knock empty room if somebody says come in i’m gonna freak out
so emily why did you decide to specialize in dermatology
i like cutting people with knives and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal
she’s scary but it’s a cute scary
can i say just one more thing i had some kind of food poisoning that day sure in retrospect gas station sushi maybe not the best choice nor was climbing out your window and running away but i think we can all understand how humiliating that was and i’d really appreciate it if we could move on
howie we moved on a long time ago
ah it’s all right they could’ve filled the bowl a little more excuse me
oh no what have i done
are you gonna introduce me to your friend
it’s not my friend nothing happened
i don’t know i heard you reading pretty loud last night
after she put you to bed she went home
oh i should call her and apologize oh no
apparently i called stephen hawking last night
hawkman it’s your old buddy sheldonoscopy how come you didn’t pick up the phone oh right my bad
not really i had a bit of an embarrassing evening
i drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for stephen hawking
i wouldn’t worry about it he’s got a pretty good sense of humour
oh i hope so what happened to you last night
oh well turns out i’d already met the girl raj is seeing when i did a number on her bathroom and that number was two
well you know i’ve always been a fan of a story told by attar of nishapur about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad and that ring was inscribed with the phrase this too shall pass
hey cooper i heard you dwunkdialed stephen hawking last night classic
clogzilla that’s pretty funny i don’t think that’s gonna pass
it’s me again i gave up string theory you should give up black holes and we can totally solve crimes together
do you know what’s great geology oh look at this geode that’s fun to say geeode geeode
geeode geeode i kiss girls now
hey guess who i am beep bop boop bop i’m you get it
are you mad at me oh no you’re mad at me i’m so sorry beep bop boop bop
thiospinel sulfide thiospinel sulfide that’s even more fun than geeode hey did you see the lego movie
so we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape dna is slowly taking over my body
but i realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage so i asked the director why and he says it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape
it’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story
oh and there’s not even a bathroom on set i have to go to the gas station across the street i mean i was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there
leonard i could use your assistance
well now that i’ve given up string theory i’m struggling to find my next area of focus so in your professional opinion which of these areas do you think is the most promising
huh well i think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter
that’s helpful okay of these four areas…
sheldon what did we say about being a nicer friend
leonard what did we say about being a gullible weenie
‘cause you’re trying too hard you need to do something else get your mind off it
hey how about we bring back anything can happen thursdays
hey that’s good why’d you guys stop doing that
you made fun of us said it was stupid
yeah sounds like me come on sheldon what do you say
all right i officially reinstate anything can happen thursday
great what do you want to do
i don’t know what do you want to do
i don’t know what do you want to do
i’m starting to remember the problem with anything can happen thursdays
hmm what can we do that’s fun
what can we do that’s different
what can we do that’s free
oh got it we order a pizza
are you kidding that’s what you always do think harder
you’re right you’re right got it we order calzones cut them open eat them like pizza all right all right i’ll shake the brain bush one more time see what falls out got it there’s a liveaction roleplaying group that meets every thursday night in griffith park and reenacts battles from lord of the rings
uh tell me more about this calzone idea
you know what why don’t we just ease into this let let’s go for a walk and and and see if we find a new restaurant
any chance that restaurant is near griffith park
raj and howard are at howard’s mom’s but should we call the girls and see if they want to come
well she talks a lot she always wants to hold hands
well if you were referring to her illness your question should have been what ails her
come on anything can happen we can push him down the stairs
hey thanks for coming to hang out
no problem how’s your mom feeling
okay but she’d feel better if she took her medicine
you know when cinnamon won’t take her medicine i hide it in a piece of cheese
good idea we can wrap the pill in cheese feed it to cinnamon and then my mom can eat cinnamon so what do you feel like doing
i was thinking we could watch a dvd
well my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy spoiler alert 20 minutes in they find a prune pit
actually how do you feel about watching house of 1000 corpses
a straightup gorefest you hate this stuff
i do but for some reason emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow so i thought if i start with you first then i could act cool about it with her
that’s actually not a bad plan i can sit through the colonoscopy now but that first time i was like oh my god a prune pit
you’re a good friend i owe you one
howard help me get out of the tub
so we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online
great you know this is how anything can happen thursday turns into it won’t stop coming up friday
hey how about that asian fusion place
fusion and asians i’m trying not to think about science
what the hell what she’s not working late
why would they lie to us
that’s a good question knock knock knock amy and bernadette knock knock knock amy and bernadette knock knock knock amy and bernadette why did you lie to us
hey listen to this murder cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await
i just helped my mom out of the tub so i’m one slippery horror ahead of you
you’re a good son i don’t know how you do it
beach blankets my friend it’s all about beach blankets
all right let’s get this over with ew it’s got someone’s hair on it
oh yeah you’re gonna do great with this movie
you’re not working late why did you lie to me
and amy you told me you were sick but you look just as pale and tired as always
i’m sorry i just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory
we kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie
but none of that means we don’t love you
i haven’t been complaining that much about the movie have i
well you know what maybe i need a break from all of you come on sheldon
we’re gonna have anything can happen thursday you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and i’m gonna complain about my movie and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do
okay ‘cause if i had to pick now i’d probably go with dark matter because…
i don’t understand my food chinese noodles with korean barbecue in a taco
my mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity
think i’ve been complaining too much about the movie
but to be fair when you talk most of what you say sounds like wah wah wah clothes wah wah wah
hey i don’t understand why you’re not upset with amy
i am so much so that i’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night
okay so in the last 20 minutes we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar we’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish
and the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother
on the bright side she didn’t even notice the pill why does emily like this stuff do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her
oh come on she could have a freezer full of exboyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her
i do like that the exboyfriend’s out of the picture
i feel so bad about lying to sheldon how am i gonna make it up to him
i’d tell you what i do with howard but i don’t think dressing up like a catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with sheldon
did you lie to howard about tonight
and you don’t feel guilty about it
between penny’s gorilla movie and howard’s gorilla mother i had no choice
thankfully penny and i have a relationship based on honesty what i don’t lie to her
oh we know you don’t lie to her
thank you hey maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these
penny there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems and that’s an oreo or a nutter butter if you’re in a pinch
come on open it i bet it says something great
this is asian fusion for all you know there’s a tiny chihuahua in here
fine i’ll go hmm people turn to you for guidance and wisdom yeah that’s a good one
turn to you for wisdom clearly that cookie is mocking you you’d never hear that kind of sass from a nutter butter
uh since you’re paying for dinner i’ll let that slide open yours
have you ever paid for a meal
your warm and funloving nature delights those around you
let me get this straight so he kills this girl’s father cuts off the guy’s face and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her
i’m just gonna say it that’s not okay why can’t i be in a relationship with a girl who likes the sound of music
raj you are the girl in the relationship who likes the sound of music phone rings hey penny what’s up no bernie’s working late really thanks for telling me
i’m having sex with a catholic schoolgirl tonight
oh i think i see our next stop
you can’t be serious if i wanted to waste my time on nonsense i’d follow leonard on instagram
no come on tonight we are trying new things
oh that’s a lot of incense or someone set a hippie on fire
yeah honey i’m still stuck at work really penny said that okay it’s true i’m sorry i’ll see you at home yeah yeah i’ll put it on
you and i never just hang out like this why is that
yeah we should do it more often
oh no i mean this is weird right now
phone text sound ah it’s penny
oh doesn’t seem like it she got sheldon to go to a psychic with her
a psychic he considers them not just mumbo jumbo but extrajumbo mumbo jumbo
well penny can be very persuasive she’s gotten me to do a lot of things i wouldn’t normally do
because she has sex with you
can i confess something once in a while i get a little jealous of how close penny and sheldon are
i mean not in a romantic way it’s just she really has some sort of connection with him
well well they’ve known each other a long time and penny grew up around horses so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish
don’t get me wrong i’m glad they’re friends i just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already
well it took him a long time to get comfortable around me too
something terrible in a former life i don’t know
i gotta go penny ratted me out fyi she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet
i don’t mean to be rude or discourteous but before we begin i’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind which means and again no insult intended that you’re a fraud your profession is a swindle and uh your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people again no offence
all right sheldon just ask your question
okay i just did what was it
oh for god’s sake look he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be
for your information i was asking her about the next star trek movie
okay i can answer that one i’ll be bored
all right why don’t we begin your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with
that’s an easy guess i’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders
yes you clearly are but i’m seeing a specific woman that you’re in a romantic relationship with
yes yes your spirit guides are on fire
the majority of people have dark hair even you at one time
does she work in a similar field to you
ha the opposite she’s a neurobiologist and i’m a theoretical physicist my spirit guides can go suck an egg
they’re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her
oh he does he so does what should he do
he should give himself to this relationship once he does all his other pursuits will come into focus
sheldon do you hear that i mean amy is the key to your happiness
exactly personally and professionally everything will fall into place once you commit to her
you know what this is yeah and i reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved this is malarkey
wow you really struck a nerve i’ve never heard him use the m word before
here we go house of a 1000 corpses
now just so you know i was a nanny for three years so if you get scared i can totally change your diaper
actually i have to tell you something these kind of movies really aren’t my thing so last night i watched it just to see what i was getting myself into
and i have to be honest i thought it was disturbing and weird and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it
then why do you watch these things
can i tell you something without you judging me
they kind of turn me on
hello i didn’t expect you this evening
well i was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night i wanted to make it up to you
and how do you propose to do that amy takes off coat and is dressed as a catholic schoolgirl unless you have gravity on bluray under that skirt i don’t know where you’re going with this
gentlemen star wars day is rapidly approaching we should finalize our plans
what that’s a real thing what is it star wars christmas
no don’t be ridiculous that’s wookiee life day
uh well it’s not may the fifth and it’s not may the third it’s may the fourth
may the fourth be with you
may the force be with you get it
oh no this face wasn’t because i didn’t get it
yes actually i’m glad you’re here i’m working on the star wars day schedule now i have a window built in after phantom menace for complaining but i’m worried an hour won’t be enough time
sheldon i’ve got some bad news
i just read online that arthur jeffries passed away
your heart might be in the right place but your head chest and arms certainly aren’t
anyway the the funeral’s on sunday
yeah um of all the things about this that are sad that might not be number one you okay i know he meant a lot to you
okay yet he cried when they changed the raisin bran box
hmm yes look at him amy it’s such a shame struck down in the prime of my life
do you want me to go to the funeral with you
oh i’m not going to the funeral
all those people blowing their noses you can’t tell the sick from the sad mm i’ll be at home celebrating star wars day as planned
are you sure you don’t want to go say goodbye
amy mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time
and watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t
if we were in a physical relationship you just lost sex tonight
hey penny happy star wars day
can i make you breakfast admiral ackbar’s snack bar is open for business
no thanks leonard and i are just going to the funeral
you sure not even coffee we have r2decaf maybe a nice cafe au leia
and if you’re not in the mood for coffee i can always make you a chai tea3po
oh i get it like c3po what happened to me
hey uh sheldon you want anything
you’re being so quiet are you upset or are you just rebooting
sweetie are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral
oh i appreciate the offer but arthur is gone and there’s nothing i can do about it when darth vader struck down obiwan did luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral
no he blew up the death star why do i know this
arthur jeffries was a scientist i’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals you know if he were here i think he’d say enjoy star wars day
he was 84 he’d say where’s my pudding
before you go at least let me pack you some attack of the scones for the road
oh like attack of the clones we are leaving right now
arthur passing away was harder on sheldon than he’s ready to admit really hoping this will cheer him up
me too although it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a death star cake
no it combines two of sheldon’s favorite things chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button
well anyway it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys and howie doesn’t think i take his interests seriously so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while
okay let’s get the fondant and start decorating
this is pretty cool you don’t see too many spherical cakes
i have a confession to make
i’ve never been to a funeral before
i just never knew anyone that died i had a pet pig when i was a kid i mean when he died we didn’t have a funeral we had a barbecue
yeah we won’t be eating arthur tonight
i didn’t know him very well but i still really liked him it’s weird that he’s just gone
i feel like i want to cry
oh that’s that’s fine go ahead
i can’t do it with you staring at me
no i’m dry you’re a big crybaby you start i’ll join in
the toys were holding hands in a furnace look arthur lived a full life and he inspired a lot of people sure he he was my childhood hero but the fact that i got to work with him side by side before he died was it was it was a gift
it was a gift thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship
okay here we go episode i
ugh let’s get this over with
since we all agree episode i isn’t our favourite maybe we just skip it this time
howard i think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it
you know i heard of this way of watching the movies called the machete order where you watch episodes iv and v then skip episode i watch ii and iii as a flashback and then finish with vi
okay so you’d lose most of jar jar all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings which are like watching cspan with monsters
get rid of the trade route part then how would palpatine get chancellor valorum kicked out of office how would he get himself elected how can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous
well you know what else was just a suggestion why don’t we change the raisin bran box hmm and you know who got hurt by that every single person who eats breakfast
i think he’s taking this professor proton thing pretty hard
should we try to console him
or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief
by staying here and watching the movie
that’s what good friends would do
well at least without sheldon here we got to start with episode iv
mm true i do feel guilty about him
maybe we should see how he’s doing
look at arthur cracking up at a joke i told him i’ll never hear that laugh again
you never heard it that time
arthur i thought you were dead
i am oh it it’s fantastic i mean this this is the longest that i’ve gone without running into a men’s room in in in years
i don’t know i was i was hoping i was going to haunt my exwife
i know why you’ve come to me because you’re my obiwan
i’m i’m not i’m not familiar with that is is is that an an internet
wow uh you’re dead so i’m going to let that slide obiwan kenobi is a character from star wars after his physical demise he comes to luke skywalker as his mentor in spirit form
well that that clears that up
you must be here to give me advice
well this this is weird most most of my robes open in in the back
oh wait what what what is what is this
oh oh oh neato i’m uh i’m going to need a bandaid
so what did you think of your first funeral
well i don’t want to be a jerk but it was kind of a bummer
yeah well when i die you can rent a bounce house
mm well i think more about if i’d have any regrets
mm you know that i didn’t travel more take more risks learn another language
no i meant that as a regret
i just thought of one more
i regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you
well it just wasn’t the right time
and this is also not the right time do not propose
i know that face that’s your propose face
i was not gonna propose it’s already two to one
i proposed twice you proposed once two to one
oh my it’s not a contest
i don’t know what you’re upset about i’m the one who’s losing
okay fine would you feel better if i propose so you could turn me down again
okay leonard will you marry me
no don’t you dare you reject me right now and tie things up
it’s just such a big decision i don’t want to have any regrets
did you ever watch professor proton when you were a kid
no my dad controlled the tv so unless someone was a texas ranger jake or the fatman we didn’t see it
i never watched him either but he seems to be the reason that sheldon got interested in science
not me i got into science ’cause i was always the smallest kid in school so i thought if i became a scientist i could invent a formula that made me taller
yeah i thought it was working for a while but then i found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame how about you
oh i guess it must have been back when i was in the girl sprouts
my mom made it up as an alternative to the girl scouts she didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore
how did that get you into science
oh i went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did
on the one hand if i say yes…
this isn’t funny anymore just say no so we’re done with this will you marry me or not
ooh interesting did you just propose to me again
really because i just heard will you marry me that’s two proposals one day sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name hofstadter
you know what fine do whatever you want
hey penny don’t get upset here i love you but no i will not marry you
now about that second proposal on the one hand…
this is the swampland of dagobah it’s where luke was trained in the ways of the jedi
oh too bad i thought it was florida
when obiwan came to luke on this very spot he gave him all sorts of helpful advice so um what do you got for me
um always get get a prenup
that’s it i thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here
well why why do you think i’m here
i suppose it has something to do with your recent passing
is is this the the first time you’ve lost you know someone close to you
oh no no i’ve already had to say goodbye to 11 dr whos
yeah i’ve i’ve outlived a few of my doctors too
of course my grandfather died when i was five my father died when i was 14
and now you’re gone too it’s like all the men i’ve looked up to have gone away
well you know it’s it’s okay to to be sad about them just just make sure you know you appreciate those who who are still there for you
well then what am i doing in a swamp dressed like friar tuck appreciate them sheldon sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door
hey buddy heard you’re having a rough day you all right
i’m okay how was the funeral
it was nice you know a lot of people showed up told some great stories about him did you know that arthur’s son is a high school sci… sheldon hugs him hey the guys are about to start jedi you want to go watch
i do after i make them go back and watch one through five first
sheldon that that’ll take us all night
that’s true oh it’s a good thing i had a nap
boy some of the physical comedy with jar jar is a little tough to watch
at least they toned him down in the second one
hey we can say it you can’t
yeah we were hoping it might cheer you up
and even though it meant we had to miss the movies we could still be part of the fun
well you didn’t miss anything we just started over
yeah apparently um i’m here whenever when whenever you need me
why do i need you now
well as near as i could tell you you fell asleep watching star wars and now you’re you’re dreaming you’re watching star wars
i mean don’t don’t you see a problem there i mean how how you’re spending your limited time on earth
thanks for lifting my spirits next time try lifting the box
the doctor says you need to get exercise
crushing my will to live isn’t exercise
if she isn’t gonna use it then why are we doing this
she’ll use it all i need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a honeybaked ham
we set it up in howie’s old room
do you know how to set it up
please i’m an mittrained engineer i think i can handle… ma look out
aaaaah i told you this thing would kill me
so she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks
should we do something for her
i know let’s go see the new spiderman movie
sheldon we’re talking about your friend’s mother she got hurt
i thought that subject had run its course so i changed it it’s called reading the room amy
hey how were things on the set
so the movie’s not as bad as you thought
oh no it is but i decided instead of complaining about it i’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all
thanks there’s no reason why i shouldn’t be the best bisexual gogo dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen
i don’t know the bisexual gorilla gogo dancer in schindler’s list is tough to beat
ah very good because a gorilla gogo dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the holocaust
it only gets funnier when you explain it sheldon
okay she’s all settled in the guest room
maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs
i’m sorry i just can’t deal with this right now
taking care of your own mother how can you say that
bernie she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks are you prepared to feed her wash her and take her to the toilet
i would do it for my mother
yeah of course you would you’re a loving person i’m what my people would call a putz
look i’m not crazy about the idea but what other choice do we have
we get a nurse preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells
you’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you that’s so cruel
not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland
sounds like a job for a loving person would you like me to play some polish music while you carry her to the toilet
thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no aren’t you gonna get 3d glasses
i brought my own no sense in risking bridgeofnose herpes
well until they invent nose condoms i’m not finding out
uh this is my friend sheldon sheldon this is emily
oh yes you’re the dermatologist i went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen do you see anything on my forehead that i should be concerned about
um you know what i better go my movie’s about to start
what do you mean not really
hey should we get our seats
yeah it was nice seeing you um i’ll call you later
is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow
good i thought she saw something on my forehead
i swear i will find a way to turn you back
what gave you the right to mix my dna with that of a killer gorilla
i was trying to save your life
life what life look at me i’m a monster and now i have blood on my hands or paws i don’t know
you can’t give up i love you
i love you too but i’m afraid i love killing more like one day i might actually try and kill you
and cut all right all right let’s set up for the next scene
actually you know what can we do one more i think i could do it better
let’s just move on no one cares
well i care i mean look if we’re gonna do this why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of
look sweetie this movie is garbage but you should be happy about that ’cause if it was a good movie you wouldn’t be in it
whoa whoa hang on there’s no need to insult her
isn’t she too hot for you
well boyfriend get off my set
you can’t do that he’s with me
you know what you can get off my set too you’re fired
what you can’t fire me i’m the star i’m the girl that goes bananas it says so on the poster
yeah but we just shot the last scene where we see your face so from now own the star of the movie is whoever wears this
hey if you’re gonna fire her then you have to fire me too
wow that fell apart really fast
thanks for skipping the movie i couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about emily and that guy
oh quite all right after my forehead melanoma scare i’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff well sorry i don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea
you don’t have to make me anything
no i do you’re upset about emily and you’re indian i need to make you chai tea now i have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds do you happen to have any on you
sorry i left them in my turban
oh i’ll make english breakfast tea they destroyed your culture that’s close enough you know i’m curious why are you so upset about seeing emily with another man
wouldn’t you be upset if you saw amy out with someone else
can’t happen we have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me
but you don’t have sex with her either
to be truthful emily and i haven’t dated that long and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other
well stick to your guns there will be a lot of pressure
it’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock
you know you’re always talking about having a baby someday this is exactly what it’s gonna be like
come on the constant fussing eating pooping burping drooling we’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own
maybe you’re right anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth
i’m just telling you now if we do have kids don’t expect me to do all the work
hey i’m a very paternal person i’d be excellent at taking care of a baby
you know the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass
forget it man it’s crap you just move on to the next thing
yeah well it’s easy for you to say you used to be famous
hey i just lost a job for you
all right i’m sorry you’re famous
penny it’s not about being famous it’s about the art it’s about the passion we have for our craft text message tone i have an audition for sharknado 2 if i book this i am totally gonna pay you back for this beer
god what am i doing with my life
you having second thoughts about acting
you were on set you saw what it was like
yeah but it’s not always that bad
what about when you did uh anne frank at that cute little theater
it was over a bowling alley
yeah but there was ample parking
and you were so good in the tv commercial
and i got itchy and swollen just watching you
leonard you are really not cheering me up
come on how can you be sad when you’re going home with all fivefootsix of this
hmm you think you’re fivefootsix that’s funny
i don’t understand it i’m a nice guy i have a great job i’m welleducated come from a good family why don’t women want to be with me
an interesting question well good night
what don’t send me home i can’t be alone right now
that’s your problem you can’t be alone
how many women have you had dates with
how many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion
eleven wait do i count the 200pound sailor moon girl that howard and i had a threesome with at comic con
i’ll stick with eleven she liked howard better
well now do you see the problem
maybe i i don’t knowit’s late i should i should go look i do get what you’re saying instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me i need to work on my fear of being alone
i was trying to suggest chemical castration but it’s my bedtime so whatever gets you out the door good night
shh i just got her to sleep
what took you so long the grocery store is a few blocks away
they only had regular yoghurt i had to go to a different store to get the extrafat kind your mom likes
then why do i smell coffee on your breath
so what after two days of taking care of her excuse me for stopping to get a mocha
a mocha well it must be nice to be queen
queen i’ve been killing myself here
well whose fault is that i wanted to get a nurse but you were all i’m nice i want to take care of people
i’m glad i got that mocha and you know what else i’m glad about i bought you a brownie and i ate it in the car
thanks a lot now i have to go rub her belly again
thanks for letting me come over
i just wanted to say how sorry i am about tonight and i want to make sure that we’re okay
uh look you and i haven’t made any commitments to each other
i know i just felt like i needed to explain the guy i was with did my last tattoo and he’s been asking me out for months i finally said yes just to get it over with
well i mean yeah it freaked me out a little but that’s my issue not yours
wow if i saw you out with another woman i’d be pretty upset
thank you not just for being upset but for believing that could happen
just so you know i’m not seeing anyone else
okay please so uh you you have tattoos
i don’t i have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing
it’s a piercing so uh how many tattoos
one on my shoulder one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder
it’s uh been a long time since i’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder
well how about you show me your piercing and i show you my tattoos
but uh before i take my shirt off i just need like ten minutes to do some crunches
oh my god what a day
no i need to start making some smart decisions
i don’t know we could get married
why because i’m a a smart decision
so i’m like a bran muffin
what no that’s not what i’m saying
no it’s exactly what you’re saying i’m the boring thing you’re choosing because i’m good for you
what does it matter the point is i’m choosing you
well it matters a lot i don’t want to be a bran muffin i i want to be a cinnabon you know a strawberry poptart something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes
sweetie you can be any pastry you want
no no no it’s too late i’m your bran muffin probably fatfree and good for your colon
you know what forget it i never should’ve brought it up
you know i want to marry you but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself
okay it may look that way but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me okay i finally realize i don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy
oh then i guess i’m in
not like i guess i’m in like i guess i’m in
so is that it are are we engaged
i’m not sure just feels a little anticlimactic
yeah it kind of does huh
oh i know this might help
where did you get a ring
i’ve had it for a couple years not important penny will you marry me
this would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger
last night was a little rough but i think we’re gonna get through this
she’s doing okay but we just lost another nurse
two and i know what you’re thinking she’s eating them
she’s just so impossible they keep quitting
a bowl full of mm’s with a few ambien tossed in
okay well now that everyone’s here penny and i have some big news we’re engaged
and i thought me having sex with emily was gonna be the big news
you guys propose all the time this never happens
boy i’m so hungry today i wonder why
because you had sex the other night
you know what that may be it by the way it isn’t like riding a bike like i fell off a few times
i just got called into president siebert’s office the university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology they’re forcing me to continue with string theory
he said it’s why they hired me it’s it’s what my grant was designated for and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do he then gave an example of something he had to do even though he didn’t want to which was look at my stupid face
that’s a rude thing to say out loud
it’s an outrage honestly i’m tempted to leave the university
you know if you’re really serious about that i hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat
whatever you do just don’t make any rash decisions
i don’t know i am really aggravated
when i’m feeling low i have sex with a girl but that’s just me
oh come on give her a chance
no life it is too short
i know you’ve only been here a day and a half but you’re like part of the family i don’t think the service is gonna send any more people
yeah maybe it’s time we just release ma back into the sea
well then we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months
but we have jobs we can’t babysit her 24 hours a day
well what if we use our vacation time
i wanted to go to hawaii not hell
i don’t know what else we can do
howie i love you and as your wife your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours so i want a divorce
hi mom i have some exciting news
before i tell you will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself
no let me save you all of your hemming and hawing sheldon already told me that you and penny are engaged
i hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me
would you like for you and me to talk more
you know what it’s probably fine
in any event while i’ve had my misgivings about penny sheldon spoke very fondly of her and if she is good enough for him then she’s good enough for me
i’m your son what about the fact that she’s good enough for me
leonard would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices
yeah well you should work on that
no mom it’s the same guy i’ve been going out with for the past two years yeah the scientist well it’s complicated i mean he works with lasers and atomic magnets no i did not see it coming no we did not set a date no i am not pregnant yeah this is a first for our family all right tell dad i love him i gotta go all right bye
sorry i’m late the leaf blower broke so i had to handdry my motherinlaw
thanks little warning before you jump into this marriage business you’re not just marrying him you’re marrying his family
i think leonard’s mom’s okay with me
it doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you the question is can she go to the bathroom by herself hit me again
so what are the living arrangements gonna be
well haven’t really talked about it yet but i figure at some point i’ll move in with him or he’ll move in with me
well with you not working that makes financial sense
you’re not working how would you like a job in home health care
i’ll pay you anything you want
i could’ve ridden a bull longer than that
i’m writing an appeal to the faculty senate so that i can move on from string theory
you tell me dear esteemed colleagues as you may know i have requested to change my field of study my decision to do so is i believe in the best interest of science at your convenience i’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand
it’s nice that you called them esteemed
you’re right i’ll take that out
so listen there was something i was hoping to float past you
now that penny and i are engaged i thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements
of course she’s spent many nights here and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding
good because not only has that ship sailed if it hit an iceberg countless men would perish
actually this is about where she and i are going to live
well well we might want to live together
oh yeah well i’ve already given this some thought and i’m willing to let penny live with us one day a week for a trial period now obviously not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining
that’s very sweet but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you
i don’t understand how could we all live together if i’m not there
look i i know this is this is change and that sounds scary
where are you going to go
i don’t know we just started to think about this maybe i’ll move in with penny or maybe she and i’ll take this place and you can move across the hall
move across the hall did you take a marijuana
did you get hit on the head with a coconut
well then i’m all out of guesses what me move across the hall why would you even suggest such a thing
because i love penny and want to give her the life she deserves
i see you’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine
how dare the university force me to go back to string theory
yeah and on top of that leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and penny are engaged he may not want to live with me any more
here i made you some strawberry quik
i have real problems here amy i can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children mmm yummy
you know this might work out for the best i mean you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate leonard is like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there
ugh it’s like walking into the amazon and not the good amazon with oneday shipping the awful one with birds and snakes
you hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain
four keys who does he think he is a warden
see maybe you’ll love living alone
and if it turns out you don’t you and i could live together
you and… oh sure and while we’re at it why don’t we get engaged too why don’t we get a little house start a family enjoy our sunset years together do you hear yourself woman
sheldon it was just a thought
no here’s a thought you’re not moving in leonard’s not moving out everything stays exactly the way it is and by the way i saw you make this strawberry quik with syrup you’re supposed to use the powder
no the syrup tastes better and i don’t like it
this is so sweet you never cook for me
well you cook for me all the time and ugh
if you don’t like my cooking why haven’t you ever said anything
it’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do
i know you’ll try so should we talk about setting a date
well i’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule
okay and when would that be
uh 12 to 18 months from now depending on good behaviour
no i thought he was with you
he was but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone
he was really angry that you suggested he move out
i also mentioned that he and i could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is
well he’s been having a couple of tough days i’m sure he’s fine he probably just needs a little alone time to decompress
you’re probably right so what are you guys doing
well leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner you know as a newly engaged couple
anyway as i was saying sheldon probably just needs a little alone time ‘cause that’s important not just for him but for most anybody really
don’t i know it what is that polenta
i was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire
and you couldn’t put it out
i was across the street at the doityourself car wash taking a shower
um i don’t know i’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company
i don’t mean to be rude sheldon but uh my life is kind of falling apart right now
your life the university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me and now the place i need to go when i’m sad is damp and smells funny
well sorry i let you down
no i do not accept this everything is changing and i hate it it stops now i’m helping you get back on your feet i would like to purchase this comic book please
you know what i don’t always recognize sarcasm but i do right now and i don’t appreciate it i’m sorry for your loss but you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster
light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before that could have killed me i can’t catch a break
i haven’t heard from sheldon in a while you think he’s okay
i’m gonna see where he is
oh i know his password so i can track his phone
not always but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon i get worried
he can take care of himself look we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle
it’s dark out and he’s alone i don’t like it let’s go get him
it’s sweet how you look out for him you’re a good guy
it’s not just that my mother would kill me if i let something happen to him
don’t take this the wrong way but did you do this for the insurance money
no god you sound like the police the firemen my parents my therapist and the insurance company
we’re here for you man whatever you need okay
uh actually i was wondering if i could crash at your place for a few nights
sure of course oh actually emily was gonna spend the night
well i can’t take all the credit she let me do it to her but uh but i can always call her and cancel
hang on i know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time
i just have to warn you it’ll involve humiliation degradation and verbal abuse
boy you chase one balloon for three miles
don’t be melodramatic i’m just getting on a train and leaving forever
seriously you don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush
my plan is to stop at malls and buy what i need it’s called living off the land
okay i know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on but it’s nothing we can’t work out come on let’s get you home
no i’ve reached my breaking point i need to leave now
so a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo
i suppose it is except i have a credit card and i refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick and i’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can
come on come home with us and tomorrow i’ll i’ll take you to legoland
legoland is not the solution to everything and it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out
leonard i am overwhelmed everything is changing and it’s simply too much i need to get away and think
oh come on you know you’re overreacting
leonard hang on just come here maybe we need to let him go
it might be good for him
you know he can’t take a trip like this by himself
no he looks like a grown man you’ve seen freaky friday sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies
leonard we can’t protect him forever
he’ll be okay you taught him well padawan
good lord padawan’s the student not the teacher
sheldon if you really need to do this i’m not gonna stand in your way
hey what are you guys still doing here i got this go go home
yeah she’s fed she took her pills she’s all tucked in and watching tv
so she’s not too much for you
are you kidding i love her she’s great
stewie you gonna watch wheel of fortune with me
she insisted so hey guys thank you so much this job is a dream come true
yeah i don’t know why but something about it feels unnatural
okay sheldon thanks for checking in talk to you tomorrow oh okay bye
actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well
i really think this is gonna be for the best
me too and he was able to take a sabbatical from…
how could you let him go
excuse me is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants oh well no you’re understandably terrified but you know allow me to explain 45 days ago um i embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory and my favorite comic book store burned down and when my room mate got engaged my girlfriend wanted to move in with me which was no doubt a ploy just to see my well excuse my language but my bathing suit parts uh sir may i use your phone
yeah well i understand that i’m half naked but there is a reasonable explanation while i slept in my sleeper car all my possessions were stolen now typically i wear pyjamas but i recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleeppants of the man i’ll have you know mahatma gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him my good man now before you walk away i know that i may appear deranged but i am in fact a worldrenowned physicist ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion go ahead ask bosons have integer spin fermions have halfinteger spin my legs are getting cold why won’t anybody help me
hi want to do yoga with me
um let me just have some coffee first and then i’ll have the strength to tell you how much i won’t be doing that phone rings hello

he got all of his stuff stolen
sheldon hang tight hey do you want me to bring anything
oh yes please a pair of pants and my toothbrush yeah and my mail and a really good comeback for chicken legs because “i know you are but what am i” was met with stony silence
i’ll be there as soon as i can

feel like driving to arizona with me
i can’t i have that job interview
besides i don’t need six hours of your hair is different why did you change your hair i’m holding my breath until your hair grows back

what are you talking about no one’s paying attention to you
wow how’s that haterade taste bro hey this isn’t the way to work
i just want to pop in and make sure ma’s okay
i thought stuart was looking after her
he was but now that her cast is off he moved out and honestly i’m kind of glad it was getting a little weird
no not like us creepy chummy like you and your dog
she feeds him out of her own mouth
i mean he calls her debbie she calls him stewie and they’re all giggly around each other and believe me when food goes in that mouth it does not come out
so are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover
first of all no one can replace me as a son i’m her little matzo ball and secondly my mother is well past having any kind of sex life
okay okay although many older women lead vibrant active…
excuse me officer hernandez any leads on the person who stole my belongings
well perhaps i can help sherlock holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth now have have you tried doing that
well maybe you should there’s lots of books called sherlock holmes and there’s no books called officer hernandez
thanks again for coming six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself
my pleasure and i’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me i love that
i haven’t been on a job interview in years i’m really nervous
don’t be you are built for pharmaceutical sales you’re cute you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things
i don’t have any experience in sales unless you count the bikini car wash i did in high school but you already made me take that off my résumé
this job is a lot like being a waitress except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the fda finds out they may cause rectal bleeding
maybe but like our lawyers say the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed anyway i talked you up to dan he’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you
oh i really appreciate this i just hope i’m not in over my head
you’ll be fine just be yourself
i wish i felt more confident
penny i wouldn’t have put you up for this job if i didn’t think you could handle it
oh thank you but maybe i should cancel
it’s too late to cancel you’re going
but i don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals
oh i understand you want to do something you’re already good at i know why don’t i get you a job at the sitting around all day wearing yoga pants factory
ma i hope you’re decent raj is here you just started seeing naked women again and i don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be
oh hey guys what are you doing here
uh what are you doing here i thought you moved out
oh yeah i was going to and then debbie and i got to talking over dinner the other night i didn’t have any place to go she likes having me around so we both said why leave at the same time it was precious
i’d like to back you up but it sounds like it was pretty precious
stewie i can’t find my glasses
be right there deb deb they’re probably on her head
or in her neck listen you staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about
well maybe if you called your mother more often you’d know
it wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone
any word on my stolen items
you know sherlock holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus but i’m sure those cool ranch doritos are doing the trick
leonard oh i’m so happy to see you
oh i’m fine why did you come
what do you mean why did i come you’re my boyfriend i haven’t seen you in over a month i just drove six hours to help you out don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come
i do but i feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers
so sheldon tell us about your trip where’d you go
where didn’t i go i went to new york chicago atlanta denver seattle
oh i have no idea i never left the train station
hang on you travelled across the entire country and never left a train station
why would i that’s where all the cool trains are
i’m sorry so you never went outside
or had a single piece of fruit
so why do you think you’d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep
well i’m a people person people like me some of my favourite people are people i feel like i’m saying people a lot people people people okay i’m done
good so how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this
uh well as a waitress sales was a big part of my job i mean believe me i convinced a lot of very large customers who should not be eating cheesecake to have more cheesecake i mean one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump
uhhuh i have an insulin pump
it’s weird right a grown man in his thirties living with my mother
that is weird i thought he was like 45
come on you don’t think it’s a little odd
i don’t know i mean she’s lonely he needs a place to stay i doubt there’s any funny business going on and even if there was who cares they’re both adults
who cares you wouldn’t care if i slept with your mom
you know what you’re my best friend and she’s in a bad marriage i give you my blessing
this is stupid i’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her
‘cause that’s what little matzo balls do
this is the part where you talk
all right let’s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor’s drugs how would you convince them to switch to ours
um any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini no okay i’m really sorry for wasting your time
don’t worry about it thanks for stopping by
okay thanks um i’m sorry listen could you do me a favour and not tell bernadette how badly i blew this interview she’ll get upset and honestly i’m a a little terrified of her
wait wait you’re scared of bernadette
i thought it was just me everyone thinks she’s so nice with that squeaky little voice
i know but she’s kind of a bully
wll she is i didn’t even want to meet you but uh i was too scared to say no to her
yeah yeah one one time i had i had to tell her we were cutting the the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing
i couldn’t do it she’s still working on it oh we’re not gonna tell her about this right
at the hot dog stand in the denver train station heinz ketchup at the hot dog stand in the salt lake city train station heinz ketchup at the hot dog stand in the indianapolis train station
wrong hunt’s hey amy what do you say you ready to move on to the mustard round
have you not noticed that i’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours
i just thought you were bad at the game
i’m mad at you how could you just go away like that without even saying goodbye and then call leonard for help instead of me
amy may i please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate
we’re in a moving car what do you expect me to do stick my fingers in my ears
well i was thinking put your head out the window like a dog but that’ll work please this’ll be quick leonard as soon as we get home i want to have coitus with amy okay she can’t hear the reason i called you is because i didn’t want amy to know i couldn’t make it on my own
oh of course it’s no big deal to you you idolize me and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on
well yeah it’s true you you are a god to me
i called leonard because i failed and i didn’t want you to think less of me
sheldon it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect
can i have one more moment with leonard
amy just hurt my feelings i want to break up with her
now i never thought i’d say this but i’m kind of excited to see sheldon
i never thought i’d say this but penny got a job today
well the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me
i uh kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom’s
you’re right i’m not i think it’s weird
it is he’s a grown man he’s just gonna live there rentfree how is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job i mean do you even have a plan
hey you’re not my father okay and besides your mother and i were talking…
your mother and i you’re not my father
i didn’t say i was your father
well i didn’t say i was your father
okay calm down you’re not his father he’s not your father nobody’s anybody’s father
i i’m sorry you don’t like my life choices but it’s my life
well it’s my house it’s my rules
oh oh okay dad if i mow the lawn can i have my allowance
hey don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him
i don’t have to listen to you
don’t talk to her like that that is my mother wife my wife i said my wife
you know what this isn’t getting us anywhere when you’re ready to apologize you know where to find me
i wish i’d never gone on that trip i feel no better now than when i left
yeah if you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country do you know what they would have said
exactly right after they said yeah
but you did do it so what if it didn’t all go your way that’s what makes it an adventure
that’s a good point you know i’m a lot like gandalf the grey he fought the balrog and emerged stronger than ever as gandalf the white i was robbed of my phone and pants and i too came back stronger and whiter too ’cause i wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks
see this trip was good for you
indeed i was the world’s smartest caterpillar and then after pupating in our nation’s railway system i’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly
butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from arizona
yeah i feel renewed i’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way
your hair is different you changed your hair i can’t take this i’m out
would you like to see pictures from my trip
i thought your phone got stolen
yeah it did but luckily all my photos got backed up to the cloud
and you thought they all had a silver lining
here day one uh this was the seat i was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it as it was first class i suspect ritz this is the train bathroom this is the imodium i took so i would never have to use the train bathroom
i cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station
i know you know i almost died in a fire in des moines but i stayed put fyi that’s when the imodium gave out
i recently read that during world war two joseph stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas
what a sick use of science
hey as long as the baby’s healthy
i wonder if stalin considered any other animals
hippos are the deadliest creature a halfhuman halfhippo soldier would be pretty badass
yes but when they’re hungryhungry you can stop them with marbles
yeah the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala you would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked
the answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses moving on
so penny when’s the new job start
did you get a chance to look over the materials i gave you
uh not yet but i will
i said i’ll get to it
i’m sensing awkwardness am i right
i don’t want to be pushy but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before it seems like you could use this time to get a head start
well the first few weeks will be all training they’ll tell me everything i need to know
but imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material
okay so what you want me to be like a teacher’s pet
mm i don’t know who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet
it was like the rest of the class wanted ms mcdonald to forget the quiz
knock knock knock mrs davis knock knock knock guess who
knock knock knock that’s right good job hello uh you wanted to see me
thank you i assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory
you mean the dialogue that went please no please no please no
that’s the one i believe you went last so uh please
dr cooper while you were away we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study
wow pouting and running away actually worked i must say that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me so um what is the solution
currently you’re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory if we promote you to junior professor you’ll be able to choose whatever field of research you’d like
but if i’m a professor then i’ll have to teach a class
so your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that i can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists
hey ready to go to lunch
just give me a minute i’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish i just need to turn it off
then i have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than i am is bernadette meeting us at the restaurant
uh no actually i didn’t invite her
well ever since she helped me get this job she won’t stop bugging me
well i think she just wants you to do well and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress
i’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago
i told you they’ll be right out
well you saw her the other night am i wrong
no i just i feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back it’s me and it’s right in front of my face
i’m sorry i just need a little break from her
i understand you know there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends
i’m saying in the spirit of science what is that little skank’s problem
so i’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and emily what do you like better emippali or koothrapemily
why is it your last name and her first name
oh well her last name is sweeney and something just didn’t seem right about koothrapeeney
hey how’d it go with human resources
awful they’re allowing me to move on from string theory but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class
i don’t understand why is it bad that you have to teach
the kids are gonna love him
i can’t believe i have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers
this might not be that bad uh you like telling people they’re wrong
wrong just because i enjoyed that one doesn’t mean i always do
a valid point but unoriginal bminus
and you love the sound of your own voice
yeah well of course i do listen to it it’s like an earful of melted caramel
look most importantly this will let you move on and study dark matter
it is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings feynman einstein professor x humorously in the case of professor x some of his students actually had wings that’s rich i’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm
measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells you like that don’t you that’s right say my name
not much you want to get a drink later just the two of us
not tonight i’m a little frustrated with her
because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it
so it’s not just me you see it too
it’s driving me crazy just this afternoon i saw on instagram that instead of studying she went out to lunch and got a manicure
if she doesn’t do well this could reflect poorly on you
exactly does she not realize it or does she not care
i don’t know the important thing is i am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party
hey we just wanted to see how your class was going where is everybody
did you send everyone to the principal’s office already
i called the department secretary to see what happened apparently i have a reputation for being obnoxious
no it’s fine now i can devote all my time to dark matter
aw you brought cookies for everyone
oh yes fig newtons i was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him and then after someone said newton i was going to tell them they’re wrong the cookies are named after a town in massachusetts and then i’d throw the cookies away
hey what if i took your class
yeah why would you do that
i’m thinking about getting my doctorate and he wants to teach why not
oh howard i appreciate the gesture but this is a graduatelevel physics class i don’t think you’d understand a single thing i was talking about
ask why not again i’ve got an answer
sheldon i’m more than smart enough to take your class
how would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution
i would guess a wavefunction and then vary its parameters until i found the lowest energy solution
hmm do you know how to integrate x squared times e to the minus x without looking it up
i’d use feynman’s trick differentiate under the integral sign
okay um what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics
since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement they are all equally correct however i know you believe in the many worlds interpretation so i’ll say that now do you think i’m smart enough
oh come on you might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me but guess what engineers are just as smart as physicists
so after drinks with bernadette i get home and penny calls to complain about her and then while i’m talking to penny i get a text from bernadette
i am trying to prepare my lesson plan for howard why are you telling me this
because it’s taken 15 years but high school is finally awesome i love them both but i’m in the centre now and i love that even more
amy please i am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine
you better watch that attitude buddy you’re dating the popular girl now
oh i’m working on my lesson plan for wolowitz he is going to be so lost look at this section over here even i don’t really understand it
sheldon why are you doing this
i’m a teacher leonard it’s my job
no i mean why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than wolowitz
oh it’s no trouble it’s actually a pleasure
you want to know what i think i think the idea that someone could be as smart as you or even smarter scares the pants off you and you can’t deal with it
interesting point you’re suggesting that i have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority
might be something to think about
howard’s allergic to peanuts how can i use that against him
okay now that everyone’s here we can begin
before we do i just talked to leonard and if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard then i’m out but if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher then i’m willing to give this a shot
i suppose that’s a fair request there’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience
okay well then uh first things first um are you familiar with the brachistochrone problem
good and how it relates to the calculus of variations
wonderful now what about eulerlagrange theorems
that’s where i’m a little fuzzy
ha i knew it all right we have a lot of information to cover before your first test which by the way is in eight minutes the good news is i’m grading on a curve so you’re pretty much guaranteed a c
all i do is win win win no matter what
everybody hands go up up and they stay there
if you’re gonna be a crappy teacher then i’m gonna be a crappy student singing uh uh ludacris going in on the verse ’cause i never been defeated and i won’t stop now…
will you stop it this is a classroom this is not american bandstand
now where was i let’s see oh yes over here you… what are you doing now
so i can shoot you with a spitball
you’re not going to do that and i’ll tell you why this is an institution of higher learning i am your professor and you’re going to treat me with the prop… you shot your spit in my mouth
is that gonna be on the test because i don’t think i can do that again
hey girlfriend can i get a what what
close enough um i was just calling to see what you were up tonight thought maybe we could hit up color me mine maybe sneak in some pinot greej whatevs
uh thanks but i think i’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff bernadette gave me
oh oh i hear you try and get that nag off your back right i mean you’re not a bicycle why’s she riding you like that
no i think she was just trying to help plus i really want to do well at this job so…
okay good luck and call me later you know if you decide she’s a bitch or something hey girlfriend
tonight you me color me mine maybe we sneak in some pinot make it color me wine
that sounds fun but i promised penny i’d come by and help her study
oh well good luck getting her to do that she’s probably off getting another manicure you remember when she did that you remember
i was probably being too hard on her we talked we’re good
oh great i’m happy for you guys you know when the two of you aren’t getting along it puts me in a really weird position
well don’t worry everything’s back to normal
you mean like where she’s nice to your face okay got it bye hey boyfriend
can’t talk spitball probably gonna die
sheldon i promise your uvula does not have an std
are you sure it just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to
you reported me to human resources
you violated the sanctity of my mouth
well i dropped your class so i hope you’re happy
i told you you weren’t smart enough to take it
i’m smart enough sheldon asking me a bunch of questions about a topic i’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything i could do the same to you
okay you enjoy making fun of engineering so much how do you quantify the strength of materials
yeah okay how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer
come on give him a hard one
that was a hard one all right how does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter you don’t know do you what’s the matter smart guy don’t know poiseuille’s law
thank goodness i got it now i can quit checking my stool
okay what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug
those are also the side effects of having a 75yearold man with an erection climb on top of you
uh no i can keep going
nah you got this let’s go for a drink i’ll call amy
okay good she seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight
okay next question for the butterfinger how long is a galactic yea
okay this one is for a cadbury creme egg
oh it’s not even easter time this is crazy
which archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces 30 square faces 12 pentagonal faces 60 vertices and 120 edges
why didn’t girls like us in high school
because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports
so how does this game work i just throw it like a real ball
yeah just nice and easy right over the plate
i’m heckling you it’s a beloved part of baseball
he’s right and given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade i’m sure you do suck
okay this is not what i meant when i said go outside and play
the angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch so guess who they called
well a lot of people who weren’t available but then me
that’s so cool congratulations i guess that makes you the athlete of the group
well not just him may i remind you that you’re talking to the seeker beater chaser and water boy of the third place griffith park quidditch team
i know watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget
cut it out you’re hurting my feelings
now you know why we’re not outside
no and neither did our waiter
well if you’re going to serve cornish game hen you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall or be prepared to learn it
it’s hard to argue with that and i know because i saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail
good i had cornish game hen
sheldon how about tomorrow night we see a movie
you guys are going out two nights in a row
i missed a number of date nights while i was on my train trip and i’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the relationship agreement
it’s better than hot it’s binding
if you’re free tomorrow night i’d love to have you join us on a double date
you are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates
oh well then come or don’t i don’t care
hey even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game
but they throw an actual ball you were throwing air at a tv
for your information i also gave leonard one hell of a high five
i’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people
they’re doing space day and nasa asked me i felt like i couldn’t say no
okay well if you want i could help you practice i played a lot of softball growing up
thank you that would be great
great and while we’re at it maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound
what’s wrong with the way i run
sheldon i’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub
at our committee meeting amy made a motion for a picnic in a park but i tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon
yeah which i was initially sceptical of until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding
you don’t even like yorkshire pudding
no it’s yucky but informing people about the history of yorkshire is yummy yumyum
after a lively debate that proposal passed by a twozero margin
nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive
ignore them amy they’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours
isn’t this when he says bazooka or something
i wasn’t making a joke i was merely stating fact amy and i have a superior relationship to yours
you don’t honestly think that do you
leonard i assumed you knew the ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and amy howard and bernadette raj and his girlfriend penny and chardonnay penny and you
there isn’t any ranking and if there were we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it
yeah and actually i drink sauvignon blanc
that’s the part you have a problem with
there they go fighting again you’d never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc
so you never played baseball as a kid not even little league
well i was going to but the day of tryouts i found my dad’s playboy collection threw my arm out
all right the pitcher’s mound in major league baseball is sixty feet six inches away from home plate
great you take this and say when to stop how much further
are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you
there’s no way this is sixty feet
you realize this isn’t one of those times i want you to exaggerate how long something is
okay i got to i i i i got to ask what makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t
for starters we enjoy spending time together
so do we and i’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things
not as well as we do
you believe this guy he has to be the best at everything
so what why do you even care
oh listen to them not even married and the honeymoon’s over
whatever you can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement
if you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract i’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the us constitution and it may not be cool to say so but i think that love affair is still pretty hot today
it’s a good thing i’m not wearing flag underwear right now ’cause there’s about to be a fire
okay it’s not that hard you just look to where you want to throw it step towards where you want to throw and throw it
that’s your help that’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane get in the airplane know where you want to go and fly it
just throw the ball let’s see what we’re working with
come on howard fire it in
so when do you guys plan on getting married
uh we’re not sure but i want to wait long enough to prove to my mother i’m not pregnant
may i have one of your fries
of course can i have a bite of your burger
some perfect couple he won’t even share his food with her
it has avocado on it she’s allergic to avocado are you so jealous of our relationship you want amy to die
i’m not jealous i just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified
everything is quantifiable that french fry a seven spiderman a nine the number nine oddly only a four
sheldon you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion
no i’m not french fries have three variables crispiness saltiness and shape which is why a curly fry only gets a two if i wanted curls for dinner i’d order a clown wig
well a relationship is more complicated than a french fry
not according to the work of berscheid snyder and omoto
oh what did those rascals do now
they developed the relationship closeness inventory which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour
yeah not to be confused with the french fry goodness inventory that’s pure cooper
it’s been around for 25 years and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers
well kind of takes the romance out of relationships
kind of it does it perfectly
sheldon and i got an eightpointtwo out of ten
fine we’ll take it right now
‘cause it’s stupid who cares what number it is
i said i don’t want you to i’m getting another drink
i’m gonna let you count this as two dates they’re a lot of work
is it too late for him to cancel
um whew is this about the test or is this about us
look i don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something i’m already worried about
that we’re engaged and have nothing in common and it scares me
well that’s not good you being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on
okay well this might make you feel better uh we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster and so that’s something that we have in common also we both think i’m not funny huh see you’re not laughing
hey mike listen nasa asked me to throw out the first pitch at an angels game you got any advice
yeah don’t do it what else you up to
there’s no upside if you do well no one cares and if you screw up you’re an idiot on youtube forever
but it’s for a good cause what about all the kids that’ll be there
that’s what i’m telling you kids are the worst my own daughter tweeted i have a giant nose
well maybe i’ll do a good job
i don’t know in space you couldn’t even toss me a pen and that was in zero gravity
okay thanks for the pep talk
anytime froot loops give your wife a hug for me she’s so much cuter than you i don’t know how you ever got her
no we’re sorry we never should have been comparing relationships in the first place
why we won you know i say next we take on koothrappali and his dog really give ourselves a challenge
i just want to say one more thing about this just because penny and i are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple
the answer is one simple test away hmm you know it’s like when i thought there was a possum in my closet did i sit around wondering no i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag
no no no i don’t want to
oh well ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad
because it doesn’t matter i don’t care if we’re a ten or a two
or a one a one is possible
marriage is scary you’re scared i’m scared but it doesn’t make me not want to do it it it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you
it would make me so happy if you said things like that
we got an eightpointtwo trust me you’re happy
mmm i love how they put a waterfall at centre field it really ties the whole stadium together
this is fun huh we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch have a hot dog watch the game
whoa nobody said anything about watching the game
i expected to see howard throw the baseball finish my hot dog and hightail it across the street to disneyland just in time for mickey’s soundsational parade
i’ll tell you what if we stay i’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead
no as long as it bobbles
howie i am so proud of you
thanks i’m proud of me too
can he really throw a ball
i have a message for the young people here today when i was asked to throw the first pitch a little voice in my head said i couldn’t do it so i practiced and practiced and you know what that little voice was right but then i remembered that i’m not an athlete i’m a scientist so today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science ladies and gentlemen boys and girls i present to you a working prototype of the mars rover and here’s the windup and the pitch
why is it going so slow
‘cause i’m an idiot who didn’t think this through
okay new plan we go to disneyland play hide and seek on tom sawyer’s island and then come back and see the end of the pitch
okay while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive here’s some fun facts about mars
okay booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster
have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken dna to create some sort of chicken dinosaur
oh i think that sounds wonderful
what you’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens
yes but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the mesozoic spot
we still on for tomorrow night
yeah i’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend
speaking of which according to a recent study out of oxford university when someone takes on a new romantic partner that person loses one or two close friends
since when do you read social science
i go to the bathroom like everybody else
why would i lose friends just because i started dating someone
yeah you didn’t lose anyone when you met amy yeah well no this study refers to romantic partners not the way i would categorize the two of us
you guys kiss and hold hands
i’ve seen him do it it’s not romantic
look i’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship
what happens if she doesn’t like us
well hey you’re my dear friends you’ll get a christmas card for a couple of years and then you’re dead to me
so howard is stuart still living with your mom
i don’t want to talk about it
my mom got him cable in my whole life growing up in that house no cable do you know how many hbos that leech had my mother get him seven seven hbos seven
long story short they have seven hbos
emily you know almost everybody here
and this is leonard this is penny
oh it’s so nice to meet you
nice to finally meet you too
wow raj you were not lying about her
hey i hear you’re a dermatologist
uh yeah i’m a resident at huntington hospital
oh i like their emergency room yeah even if it turns out you don’t have dengue fever they still let you take a lollipop
you know penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep maybe she can practice on you some time
oh it would be great to practice on a real doctor
yeah i’m sure that’d be fine
i have some odd freckles on my buttocks can i make an appointment for you to look at them
i’m with him three years nothing she’s with him two minutes and he’s taking his pants off
last night was fun what did you think of emily
i don’t know i kind of got the sense she didn’t like me
did she say she didn’t like you
of course not no one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face
you guys just met why would she feel that way
it’s just this vibe i got
i’m sure you’re worried about nothing
yeah you’re probably right i used to think my high school pe teacher didn’t like me but it turned out she liked me a little too much
yeah it was fine we went to a melissa etheridge concert i got an a it all worked out
when you go to emily’s office to practice you’ll see it’s fine
you really went your entire life without anyone saying i hate you to your face
i’d say it now but look at those cheekbones
i miss stuart’s place all this loud music and exposed brick what is this a comic book store or a rave at the third little pig’s house
yep i wish stuart would reopen i hate this place too
okay him i believe because he’s an 80yearold man in a 15yearold’s tee shirt but you’re just upset about stuart and your mom and all their hbos
yes i am you know i can’t even watch game of thrones now without thinking of mother saying stuart which one is thrones
you know he might not reopen he didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company
oh boy if there is one thing that gets my goat it’s those dadgum insurance companies
why because they won’t get off your lawn is stuart trying to get a loan or or find investors
all i know is he’s got my mother buying fourply toilet paper i mean fourply if his butt is so delicate why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit
for starters they shed and bite
hey here’s a thought why don’t we put up the rest of the money that stuart needs
so we’d be like owners of a comic book store
it’s kind of a dream come true
ooh maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place
i’ll give you a plan right now step one open comic book store step two start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts step three buy a big bag to put the money in
thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you i really appreciate it
um i brought coffee i wasn’t sure what you like so i got a regular a cappuccino and a chai tea since you like raj i thought you might be into that
thanks if we could get started i’m a little busy
oh yeah sure let me just get out my materials leonard gave me this briefcase he used to carry it around in high school you can still see the dent where they whacked him with it okay i would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill femevra
so femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure
it has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives although it can cause acne which if you ask me kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive
okay i’m sorry did we get off on the wrong foot because since the other night i kind of feel like you might have a problem with me
are you sure because it doesn’t seem fine
okay if you really want to talk about this i do have a problem
oh my god tell me what did i do
look it’s nothing it’s just raj told me that a while ago you two hooked up
what oh why would he say that
well i wouldn’t exactly call it a hookup
so what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition
oh kids buy comic books it would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store
you know when i was a kid i loved going there but i could never get a ride
ooh what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up
nice you mean like at parks and schools
hold on so your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up
and are you gonna use candy to lure them in
you told emily we hooked up
um well in my defence i tell everybody
we were having a conversation about past lovers
we weren’t lovers come on everyone knows we didn’t sleep together we got drunk and fooled around why couldn’t you just leave me out of it
well we were being honest you would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped leonard
well i would never leave you off my list and not just because without you we’re playing fast and loose with the word list
well good job now she hates me ugh
on the bright side that oxford study was right one friend down i wonder who you’re going to lose next
you okay it’s you you’re you’re next
i don’t know what emily’s so upset about anyway even if i had slept with him so what everyone has a past
come on look how pretty you are i’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you
and i’m sure you can turn it around
how you can’t force someone to like you
what if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down i mean next thing you know you’re in her home you’re eating her food drinking her wine
oh i know why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself
yeah but instead of selling a drug you’d be selling penny it’s cute
well maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas
i’m gonna go with penny on this one then again why wouldn’t i i mean we go way back
oh my god i didn’t used to like you
you know the more i think about it the more intrigued i am about having our own store
we’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves
and we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers like this isn’t a library buy it or get out
you say things like that all the time
yes but as a store owner i’ll finally have a good comeback to you don’t work here shut up
uh do you know how penny told raj he should have left her off his list
well do you think when she and i had that conversation she left people off her list
because if she hadn’t she’d still be wading through the list
will you stay out of this
if only penny had said that once in a while
hey what difference does it make you’re the one she wants to marry
yeah and i’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship
yeah he’s right once in a moment of candour i told amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill she stormed out which was sad because we were playing scrabble and i had all the letters to spell persimmon
why are you even part of this conversation you don’t know anything about women
i know that if i had a wife or a fiancée i’d ask her first before i invested money in a comic book store
yeah well of course i am i was also right about her hair it did everything but quack
there’s something i wanted to run past you
mm the guys and i were thinking about investing in stuart’s comic book store is that okay
well you know we’re engaged and it’s kind of a big deal financially it seems like something we should talk about
oh well would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially
mm so me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity
but you didn’t hear what it was
it’s to help reopen the comic book store
howard you know we’re saving up for a house
i know but all the guys are doing it we’re splitting it four ways so it’s really not that much money
it just seems like a risky investment
i get that i okay look the real reason this is important is before my dad left me and my mom he used to take me to the comic book store it was one of the few things we did together
oh howie i had no idea
well i don’t like to talk about it
oh baby that story’s made up isn’t it
that’s how much buying a comic book store means to me
i’d like your honest opinion on something
now before i start i need you to know that i’m very excited about this and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question so keep an open mind
i’m feeling a little backed into a corner sheldon
perfect now i’m considering investing in stuart’s comic book store
interesting can you see how a grown man an accomplished scientist who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources
then i think it’s a terrific idea
great wait till you hear about our van
uh listen penny before you start i just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office
no no no need to apologise
excuse me can i say something i just love both you guys and i want you to get along and when i say love i meant as a friend and uh way too soon right
okay sit down listen emily what happened between me and raj was a long time ago
it was and i may have made it seem like a bigger deal than i should have
yeah and leonard and i are engaged now and i’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us
mm i’d like that too yeah i thought i’d be okay with it but then i saw how pretty you are
oh that’s so sweet i mean look at you you are gorgeous
it’s true you’re both gorgeous kind of says something about the man who could bed you both you get why i’ve been alone most of my adult life
well i don’t need a reason it’s my house
technically it’s your mom’s house but we certainly want you to feel welcome
mm just try and call first
okay let’s get down to business howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store but before that happens i have a few questions
oh i appreciate the offer but actually your mother already gave me the money
yeah i told her it was too much but she said she was happy to help out her bubala
excuse me ma you are cancelling that cheque and stuart is not your bubala i’m your bubala you can’t have more than one bubala
i don’t know who he’s talking to she’s at target buying me shirts
i’m so glad we could work this all out
you know we should have dinner one night with you and leonard
i’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store
i know i was looking forward to it
it would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours where we could just sit and read comics in peace
well i guess it was too good to be true
hey i read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking
we had that idea years ago how come we never did anything with it
probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant and none of us wanted to walk back
i know the real reason you never made progress with that idea you thought of it september 22nd 2007 two days later penny moved in and so much blood rushed to your genitals your brain became a ghost town
i remember it distinctly because i had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of dr seuss’s death
no one wants to hear it
why die why did he die old told i was told he was old
penny is not the reason i didn’t pursue that idea
oh really since meeting her what have been your greatest accomplishments
getting penny to go back out with him after she dumped him
and a few weeks ago he almost did a pullup
i think someone owes me an apology
well don’t feel bad i think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives
oh very much so listen to this this is from two days ago hi hope you’re having a good day who has time for this constant sexting
well maybe we have lost our focus
it wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas
ooh we could have one of those retreats
my cousin has a cabin out in the woods
i’m not going to a cabin in the woods did you see the movie cabin in the woods
then we’ll go to a hotel
a hotel did you see the shining
we could go up to big bear and get a house on the lake
did you see the lake house
nothing bad happens in the lake house
yeah well no not to them to me time traveling mailbox the only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet
fine then we’ll just stay here and do it
well you didn’t suggest a beach house
you would go to a beach house
well good lord no have you seen jaws
hey so the guys and i are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend i just wanted to know if that’s okay you and i had talked about going to brunch on sunday
want to go to vegas this weekend
bernadette girl’s weekend vegas you in
i’ll check my underpants i’m so excited i think i peed
hey i didn’t think you’d make it
well ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit
for your information emily is working tonight
yeah one would assume on getting out of the pit
okay let’s focus the girls are gone we have 48 hours there are no distractions let’s change the world
ooh this is exciting we’re innovating i feel like we’re in the facebook movie
oh it’s wonderful and i swear i’m not saying that because justin timberlake is in it
yeah i have it on bluray we should watch it
guys in 30 seconds we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch tv
i’m sorry is that a no
okay no leonard’s right we’re here to focus didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas
i i think i still have it
i did not get a clear answer i’m gonna set this down now
ah here it is whoa i haven’t looked at these in years robot girlfriend
wait i’m confused why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute
there’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend
boy when you met bernadette the field of robotics really took a hit
okay let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with all right no here we go ergonomic heated seat cushion
you know let’s just come up with something new
you know a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction the the geosynchronous satellite from arthur c clarke the motorola flip phone that came from star trek and i’ve long suspected that the idea of an africanamerican president was stolen from the movie deep impact
hey the future they show in back to the future ii is only a year away a lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet
how cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality
if we could figure out the scientific basis for marty’s hover board that would have universal application
well it’s it’s possible at absolute zero but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions
i think i have the same one
we got to watch back to the future ii
so where should we go first
ooh there’s a cover band in the lounge
well what do you want to do
well we’re in vegas i want to go downstairs get a bucket of margaritas dance until i vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere
what if we don’t want to vomit
oh you will that’s why they give you the bucket uhoh
it’s my boss they moved my field ride up to monday
it means instead of having a week to study i only have two days
can you start in the morning
uh it’s kind of a lot you know let me do a little tonight and i’ll catch up with you guys later
so um now that penny’s not coming…
hold on pause something doesn’t make sense look in 2015 biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955 to give it to his younger self but as soon as he does that he changes the future so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015 not the 2015 that marty and doc were in
wait whoa whoa is placed right
is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future
okay so it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions that’s when he altered the timeline
yeah but he had will haven’t placed it
unlike hot tub time machine this couldn’t be more simple when biff gets the almanac in 1955 the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which marty and doc brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015 therefore in the new timeline marty and doc never brought the time machine…
marty and doc never had have had brought
i don’t know you did it to me
oh i’m going with it marty and doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015 that means 2015 biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 biff therefore the timeline in which 1955 biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 biff never gets the almanac and not just never gets never have never hasn’t never had have hasn’t
he’s right also what kind of name is biff sounds like when you pop open a can of pillsbury dough biff
oh that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies
do you know that the word wiener comes from the german name of the austrian capital vienna or wien
do you know if you look at austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener
guys what are we doing we sent the girls away so we could focus
maybe after this you’ll be in the mood for some manilow
i think after this i’ll be dead
look at us out while penny’s in the room studying
i’m proud of her this is a great opportunity it’s nice to see her take it seriously
it is but enough about penny let’s talk about us we’re looking good
better than good i mean look at you your body’s bangin’
don’t amy me we’re always talking about how hot penny is come on scientist to scientist how big are those hadron colliders
oh don’t be embarrassed i’ll show you the divot in my spine
no no it’s okay i was born with it if you put a doublea battery in there it makes my leg kick
oh this is already better there are far fewer distractions in here
plus this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work
so i’ve been thinking about the hover boards and maybe there’s a way we could use maglev technology
or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials we could utilize quantum coupling
well i wonder if anyone’s tried that
go online and look it up
oh i can’t argue with him it’s right there on the screen austria does look like a wiener
that’s nothing dude go check out how hung florida is
i’m sure mrs florida’s walking funny can we get back to work
yeah he’s right oh here’s a thought what if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic
yeah exactly did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play pingpong
some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic
not getting to see who wins at pigeon pingpong comes to mind
we could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked
mmm not bad you know in medieval times idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle it’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue
we had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there
it was us the whole time
why’d you tell her it was working
you guys look like you’re having fun
guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps
then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress
hey penny hey let’s go we found a place that has australian male strippers
we want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction
that sounds so great but i have a little more studying to do
come on do you want to sit here being a loser or do you want to watch me climb into an australian man’s gstring like a baby kangaroo
all right guys look i would love to go out but i’ve got to get this done okay so have fun at the club and if you get in trouble find a policeman and if he’s taking off his pants he is not a real policeman
okay okay this is obviously very important to her let’s just we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker here here i’m gonna quiz you i’m gonna quiz you i got your notes i got your notes i got your notes if you want these they’re gonna be at the strip club
okay so we agree whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off
and i really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think i’ve been cheating on her
all right now one benefit of quantum coupling…
wait a question who decides if someone’s gone off topic
i think it’ll be pretty clear if not we’ll take a vote oh and also…
we didn’t have to that was clearly a tangent now come on back to work if we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… aah why
you said quantum coupling that made me think of the show quantum leap that’s a tangent and it’s your fault
that’s ridiculous sheldon i vote that is not a tangent
thank you and now i owe you one
ooh that is a lot of hair ow and now i’m gonna hear it from jenny
everyone stop this was a stupid idea negative reinforcement isn’t working
i think you mean positive punishment negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus it’s a common mistake
oh it’s used incorrectly all the time even bill murray makes that mistake in the first scene of ghostbusters
huh bill murray did get it wrong
jump ahead to the stay puft marshmallow man
leonard’s right we can’t just jump ahead we have to watch the whole movie
look we keep procrastinating we saw back to the future ii pigeons playing pingpong a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like denmark
yeah sorry for clicking on that
it’s late we’ve wasted hours can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight
but we didn’t see them bust one ghost
so you’re you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a saturday night and watch the rest of ghostbusters on a crappy laptop
see isn’t this better than a hotel room
have you ever seen a body so fine
we had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class but none of them moved like that
good morning you want to go to the pool come on you said it yourself only nerds and losers stay in the room wow it’s bright out isn’t it bright i should probably close these curtains nah bye
would you please close the drapes
oh thanks got a couple new outfits for work
how does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors looking like that while you sit here you know looking like this
you know when you bend over i can see down your shirt
speaking of new careers how are things going with dark matter sheldon
oh yeah i’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field
you know the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter
yeah i’ve read about that they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines
you know sheldon if we apply to be one of those teams we could be on the ground floor of something big not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well
wait hang on you guys are gonna work in a mine
you had a panic attack when we went through the car wash
perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned
i think what penny meant is the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny it’s like a cat riding a roomba
if they get scared they’ll have those hats with the lights on them ’cause down there it’s nightnight all the time
maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go eeooeeooeeoo
yeah it’ll help them get away when they see a ggghost
are they making fun of us
i miss the old days when i couldn’t tell
so one of my favourite video games of all time is called shadow of the colossus and it was only for playstation 2 but then they came out with a new version for ps3 with better graphics i finally got the chance to play it and for some reason it just wasn’t as good as the first one or something about yoga
i’m sorry i was thinking about work
well i was just saying that there was this video game…
yeah that’s when i started thinking about work uh listen i’ve got some good news
well you know how they gave me the company car didn’t make sense to have two so i sold the other one
yeah and there’s your money back and now we’re even how great is that
oh come on leonard i know the car was a thoughtful gesture and i really appreciate it but it doesn’t make sense to have both
what should i have done taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever
well good because that’s what i did
aw oh thank you that is so sweet
well it’s not that sweet i paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage
you know what you don’t have to give me this you keep it
the car was a gift it was something you needed i was happy to help you out
and i really appreciate it but now i don’t need it so here you go
well this is silly so you don’t need the car but you could use it to buy yourself something else like a new purse to put all this money in
sweetie i can buy my own stuff i have a good job now
i know and i’m proud of you but that doesn’t mean i can’t do something nice like this
okay i don’t want this to turn into a fight
great thank you can you pass the salt please
sure in my mind that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex
i’m always busy this mind is capable of advanced multitasking you know currently i’m attempting to solve the penrose conjecture i’m composing my nobel acceptance speech for when i’ve solved the penrose conjecture and i’m wondering how mermaids have babies
don’t they lay eggs on a rock
now i’ve got room for another thing what do you want
so i did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines and the guys might be right sounds pretty rough down there for starters it’s very humid and about a hundred degrees
well i’m from texas and you’re from india we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit next
it’s also a live mine so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance
yeah i have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream next
oh you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time
yeah we have to be somewhere
well there’s no toilets we’ll have to do our business in a bucket
so it’s settled we’re not doing it
look i get it but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity i was thinking about when howard was training to go to space they put him in a simulated environment
interesting you’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it
so where should we do it
well i’ll just google hot dark and moist see what comes up
oh there well look there’s all kinds of videos
i was hoping we could talk about the money again
oh sweetie just forget about it
no no no no hear me out i know things got a little weird last night
well leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird
well i think i came up with a pretty good solution
why don’t we just put the money in a joint account it’ll be our first money together we can use it for the wedding the honeymoon whatever
you know what that’s great i love that
yeah of course you do i’m not just a genius in bed you sure are baby
you two want to be alone
i want you to know i get why you don’t want the money you’ve got this new job you’re excited about being financially independent and i am nothing but proud of you
oh thank you so much it feels so good to hear you say that and i want you to know that i get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship and i’m trying to be sensitive to that
well i just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because i’m less reliant on you now and that’s a little scary
hmm maybe or maybe i tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues
or maybe now that i’m no longer an outofwork actress who can’t pay for her own dinner that makes you a little insecure
well i can’t believe you’d say that you know how insecure i am about my insecurities
you know what i’m sorry it’s stupid to fight over money
yeah i’m sorry too we’re about to share the rest of our lives together it’s our money who cares who has it
ugh you’re right who cares mm get that money out of my back pocket or i will break your fingers
huh all this time i never knew there were steam tunnels down here
most universities have them when i was an undergrad i spent three days in one pledging a sorority
no they forgot i was there but it really opened up my pores
well according to my research the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines
this is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym
plus there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked
or totally naked i love howard but the dude needs a little shame
all right amy this walkietalkie is yours if we run into any problems i’ll contact you and if anything bad happens what’s the rule
save you first come back for raj only if there’s time
sheldon i’m really impressed you’re willing to try this
well admittedly this brushes up against my wellknown aversions to heat small places going below floorlevel dampness hatches ladders darkness echoes and eliminating in home depot buckets that last one is quite new but i have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list
yeah as the person beneath you allow me to say i know
uh let’s see 704 no wait it’s on clock uh the real answer isn’t much better 102 degrees
well that’s what we wanted this is as hot as the mines will be
true sheldon’s mine simulation log entry one koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves
oh of course what did you guys want to talk about
well you know now that we’re engaged we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple
i told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them
i didn’t think they were going to i just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting leonard’s feelings
so what did you want to know
well do you guys ever fight over money
sure sometimes i mean it can be a little awkward since i make so much more money than howie
you didn’t have to say so much more
well i didn’t have to but for the sake of accuracy i felt that i should
i brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship too
like what your incomplete set of star trek collector plates
for your information i just bought the last one i needed on ebay
there were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition scotty from a smokefree home
let’s not talk about this in front of our friends
was it more or less than falconry school
for the tenth time that was a groupon
like i would swing with him
let’s set up the equipment it’ll help take your mind off of it
miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up
do you know any mining songs
just the hits singing where it’s dark as a dungeon and it’s damp as the dew
where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few where the rain never falls and the sun never shines yes it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
it’s a little more bleak than i thought
well i pray when i’m dead and the ages shall roll that my body will blacken and turn into coal
then i’ll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner that mines my poor bones
okay how ’bout a little miley cyrus next
talk about wasted money what about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time
well maybe i would have paid it if i wasn’t also doing everything else around here
oh you’re saying i don’t do anything around here look at my chore chart
she made him a chore chart
do the dishes there’s a star right there
that was a pity star putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes
that pan had to soak and you know it
well don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance
it’s not an allowance it’s a stipend and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends
i usually don’t like lemon bars but these these are really good
so as hannah montana miley was a worldfamous pop star but then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl which i don’t have to tell you at that age is its own headache
that’s preposterous how would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig
but you’re okay with superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses
he doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses he combs back his curlicue and affects a mildmannered personality
you guys doing okay down there
i told you to use the walkietalkie
you guys doing okay down there
please keep this channel clear for emergencies thank you
i’m going to the vending machine do you want anything
this is a simulation we have to survive on the supplies we brought
we should have asked her to get some funyuns
you’re not going to have funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the earth
what if we brought them down with us
some york peppermint patties a couple of dr peppers and run to best buy and see if they have a portable dvd player and season one of a show called hannah montana
have her get season two season one it was still finding itself
sorry you guys had to see that
yeah it just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened
money’s a sensitive subject for howie because of the difference in our income
well sure there’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers so even though he’s happy for me it’s just a little tough on him
well if i do well in sales i could end up making a lot more money than you
not a problem i grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life so really it’s what i think love looks like
i’ll be right back i’m gonna go check on him
maybe it’s a good thing we came here it’s like a lesson in what not to do
yeah i don’t want something dumb like money to come between us
it won’t let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married
why are you being so bossy
why are you being a baby
i’m not a baby i’m a grown man and i made the bed now where’s my star
hang on i want to see if he gets the star
as someone from the tropical subcontinent of india you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature
huh that does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are we could take some more simulated instrument readings
my major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay
you tell me i feel like i can’t breathe and i am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs
sheldon if this is too much we can stop
you don’t have to bite my head off
i apologize i just i’m plagued by an internal struggle
if you would just use the bucket you’d be so much more comfortable
it’s dark matter when i entered the field of string theory i was a prodigy i rose to a position of respect and i assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory now here i am in my 30s i’m back at square one and frankly it’s frightening
sheldon you know what i think of when i’m scared voyager
voyager the space probe or voyager the star trek tv show
good because i am too hot and tired to go on about how much i hate voyager the tv show
by the time i was born voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over it had seen jupiter and saturn and all their moons but it kept going when i left india for america i was never more scared in my life i had no idea what lay ahead whenever i feel that way i think about how voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system going further than anyone ever thought it could don’t leave you can do this
it’s too late for koothrappali let’s go
11 minutes that’s longer than i thought
they’re in my shirt they’re in my shirt they’re in my shirt
okay this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money
i’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before me neither leonard it’s my first time too
i’m so sorry i made you feel bad about the money stuff
no it’s not okay i want us to be partners equals adults in a mature relationship
now let’s talk about your birthday party
do you really need me to transcribe this
you’re not doing it for me you’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle voice on recorder sheldon’s mine simulation log entry four my kit kat has melted all is lost
you call yourself a friend i was trying to help you and at the first sign of trouble you ran away leaving me to fend off a family of rats you’re a completely selfish human being and a and a physical and a moral coward
his statements of the obvious continue to annoy
so what are you working on these days
i’m studying onecelled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame
what would a onecelled organism have to be embarrassed about
same as all of us getting out of a car without underwear
speaking of underwear i have some interesting news
okay if it’s sometimes howie wears yours leonard already told us
he was being funny i’m pretty sure anyway i was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in california isn’t that cool
bernadette is a successful microbiologist she should be celebrated for her achievements not her looks i mean what kind of message does that send
i think the message is check out the rack on that scientist
why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty
i just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead
okay what’s the big deal look if it helps me make a sale with a physician i don’t think it hurts to flirt a little i mean laugh at their joke touch their arm maybe crank up the ac in the car beforehand you know to wake up the girls
maybe it’s different in the world of sales but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science
i was kind of excited about the article but now you’re making me feel bad
no i think you should do whatever you want you know maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them i would’ve become a theoretical physicist stop smirking at each other
no thank you delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce it’s because of people like you people like me can limit our human contact i’d shake your hand but well you know
i’m not a delivery man i’m a doctor although i do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients
yeah i bet you leave your patients in stitches that was also humorous
are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis that wasn’t a joke
all right these are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office
hmm you know they have delivery people that will do that for you
i was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the internet and then showing up unannounced at her door
making the extra effort good for you
great timing food just got here
uh mee krob and chicken satay
no but you can have mine
eh well very well oh and on the topic of sharing things that are yours there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak
what why didn’t you say that first
why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce we can both play this game
oh hi uh does penny live here
well uh i met her at my office she winked at me and uh i came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship
okay um look i’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you
oh she did seductively like this and then she touched my arm for two mississippis like you know one mississippi two…
i got it i got it listen um i think there’s been a misunderstanding see penny is my fiancée
really i’ve never seen her wear an engagement ring
so am i to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique
when will i learn it’s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again
oh uh she touched my arm for five mississippis and i bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat which she was always too busy to come over and see you give these to penny you’re a you’re a lucky man
oh uh you probably don’t want her to see this it’s unnecessarily graphic
hold on doctor leonard where are your social skills this man is clearly upset we should invite him in for a hot beverage
he tried to score with penny
so have these two and they’re having dinner with us
it was fine but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article
i don’t know they just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it
well i’m really sorry but i think it’s for the best you want people focusing on your achievements not staring at your breasts in some magazine
i guess it’s really not that important hey up here
sorry it’s just we’re we were talking about them so look i i wasn’t going to say anything but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled i have a little confession i’m the reason it was pulled
i sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing email
i simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality let alone showing them in various stages of undress
because no one wants to see neil degrasse tyson in a wet tshirt bent over the hood of a porsche
well it doesn’t make a difference because they agreed it was in bad taste and now you agree so amy saves the day
no what happened was you got jealous so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity
that’s for me to decide not you
i disagree as a female scientist i think what you do affects all of us
and i think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours oh amy i’m so sorry that was over the line
please don’t go up until my vicious attack you were the one in the wrong
here you go doctor red zinger with one teaspoon of honey
thank you neat star trek mug i actually have one of the phasers from the original tv show
oh easy gene roddenberry needed a vasectomy
wow he really went where no man has gone before
i don’t like to bragbut uh you see i’m kind of the doctor to the stars’ urinary tracts
uh you you want to see james cameron’s kidney stone
he was so happy after he passed it he gave me a terminator
that is amazing how long have you been collecting
ever since i was a kid but uh i didn’t really get serious until william shatner’s bladder infection
what’d you get what’d you get
well he said it was a tribble it could be a toupee but either way it’s pretty cool
i would love to see your collection
anytime uh i’ve got some cool stuff when i first started i thought it would be a good way to meet women but well you know
can i ask you a personal question
um i mean you’re a guy like me so how’d you get a girl like penny
oh well you know just being myself really
oh please you know i’ll tell you how he did it implacable relentless badgering in urology terms he was a drugresistant staph infection and she was a urethra that could not shake him
i don’t know that i’d call myself an infection
a gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra
can we please change the subject
well that didn’t go your way
dr lorvis what are you doing here
uh well actually i came to see you
ah that’s a good question apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available
oh god don’t make it so hard on her look the first someone is the deceitful you the second someone is the delightful dr lorvis
oh this is very embarrassing dr lorvis i am so sorry i did not mean to lead you on
you touched my arm for two mississippis
oh that’s why you were mumbling mississippi
so what other celebrity genitalia have you handled
so uh what’s the deal you take off your ring when you go to work
what no no i just put it on the other hand and turn it around keep that hand in my pocket
well what do you mean why look i make more sales if these doctors think i’m single i did the same kind of thing as a waitress the real question is what is he doing in your apartment
oh he was upset so sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage
no i got upset and sheldon made me a beverage too
okay he just showed up at my door don’t you think that’s a little weird
a little but he’s basically harmless he’s actually kind of a nice guy
okay whatever look my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work you got to get rid of him
why am i the one that has to get rid of him
i can’t do it he’s my best client
all right i’ll get rid of him but you owe me one
hey we’re going to oliver’s house to see his collection you want to go with us
leonard i was wrong heaven does exist and it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in sherman oaks
welcome to my fortress of solitude this is where i go to get away from all my other solitude
oh come on it’s a replica
oh i think i just cheated on my wife
oh i was hoping for a juicy tidbit about ron perlman’s testicles
still lives with his ma yikes right
yeah i’m not quite sure how to respond
wow donkey kong this this was my game when i was a kid
because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small oddlyshaped man
well now don’t get defensive you’re oddlyshaped but you got the girl
so i’ve noticed leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with penny
yes if you’d like to join in the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure
so you think she’ll be single soon
oh if you want to get in on the pool you’re too late all the squares have been purchased
interesting excuse me i have to take care of something
leonard as your friend i feel i should tell you something
i’m still upset about that peanut sauce
oh could you hold the door
thank you they’re for a girl uh i’m being implacable and relentless
she keeps sending me mixed signals but i think we both want the same thing
i guess that’s all anybody wants
well i hope you get it
no i’d look silly in that helmet
why not i mean you want what i want and we had two wonderful mississippis
but what about the other girl
oh right i’ll tell her we should just be friends
penny we should just be friends happy
stick your head in there and find out
you fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo you will not fool me again
i wonder where dr lorvis is he’s been gone a while
maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy
it’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings
okay now you’re messing with me
uh guys we’re locked in here
oh this day just keeps getting better
so you just left them alone playing games in your house
well they seemed happy and i thought that would give me time for you and i to get to know each other better that was before we met
doc you’ve got to see what you’re doing is is a little creepy
you sound just like sigourney weaver when i followed her into a restroom
okay you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you
well that’s not what sheldon says and he seems to know his way around the ladies
hey leonard guess who’s back dr lorvis yeah you care to join us what you locked them in your basement
well they’re they’re not locked in the door just sticks
okay so how do they unstick it
okay nope that’s it we are gonna go over there right now and you are going to let them out
oh good you’re here amy i am so sorry
that has to wait this weirdo locked the guys up in his basement
better than okay i am having the game of my life
dr lorvis isn’t there something you want to say
yes i’m very sorry for locking you in my home
yeah that was very uncool get the hammer get the hammer
well while we wait would you like to see tobey maguire’s prostate sonogram
oh spoiler alert he was worried about nothing
oh hey oh we ran into your mom at benihana last night
oh yeah she loves that place every time they flip a shrimp in the air she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it that’s why i don’t take her to seaworld
i know youyou don’t want to hear it but she was there with stuart
it doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates
they’re not dating they’re just two friends who went out to dinner
and then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins
hey lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating
fine it bothers me you happy
you think you’ve got problems the gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape
all the nonhuman apes are classified as great apes except one that means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef
but the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as it doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon
true sorry kid you’ve got it worse than a gibbon
we brought snacks for movie night
oh great i don’t suppose you also brought napkins clean bowls utensils and a roll of toilet paper
ah you guys are the best
well with all the new stuff i bought for work i needed to make room in my closet
i meant why are they folded but whatever ooh what’s this
that believe it or not is my prom dress
wow you still have it i just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere
what kind of teenager did you think i was
how was your prom did you go
no but i was on cleanup crew
no it was okay the dj let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down whenever i see a bucket of dirty water i still hear lady in red
my prom was pretty terrible too i was so excited about my date but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend he spent the whole night talking about her
okay we get it you had a friend and a date stop bragging
doesn’t matter prom is silly anyways
easy for you to say you probably went with the captain of the football team
no i just made out with him a little while his date was puking
my date would’ve had to clean that up
ooh i have an idea maybe we can have like a prom doover
oh that would be so much fun we could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos
ooh and get our hair done and slowdance
okay guys trust me as someone who’s been to like seven proms it is never as good as you want it to be
yeah let’s see uh four under the seas two enchanted evenings and one night to remember that i cannot remember for the life of me
she and amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing
oh yeah i got that evite ever since i saw pretty in pink i’ve wanted to go to an american prom but then i saw carrie and i did not want to go to an american prom but then i saw never been kissed and i’m back on the prom bandwagon this prom thing’s been a real roller coaster
bernie’s really excited i could tell because her voice got so high the beagle next door started howling
did you go to your prom
no i had a date with a proper education instead of a tuxedo i dressed myself in good habits instead of spiked punch i enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge instead of dancing in a gym i shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…
how come you’re not shopping with amy and bernadette
let me guess you think the whole idea is lame
well who cares what i think what do you think
hmm to be honest it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you
well now i can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch
ooh every single person rsvp’d yes this is so exciting isn’t this exciting
look even stuart’s bringing a date i wonder who it is
you know exactly who it is he’s gonna bring my mom why did you even invite him
because he’s our friend and you two need to get along and why can’t he take your mom you took her to your prom
i didn’t take her she was a chaperone
i saw a picture of you two dancing together
what was i gonna do they were playing our song i can’t take this anymore
stuart we have to talk this thing with you and my mom i hate it it’s making me crazy you and i were friends for years and now you’re bringing my mother to a party i’m going to what the hell
i’m not bringing your mother i have a date
oh so now you’re cheating on my mother
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what are you talking about there’s nothing weird going on with me and your mother
stewie your bath is getting cold
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
next time i might be in a rush it’s good to have a few in the bank
i’d like to discuss this party that amy and bernadette are throwing since you and i are both reluctant to go i think i’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it
we pretend we’re aliens i’m not the best at reading facial cues but i’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more now in the beloved novel hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy an alien named ford prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about earth for the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy which is a travel book within the actual book which is also called the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy
my point is pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism i’ve used many times i did it the first time i went to see you in a play you had no idea commander umfrumf of ceti alpha three was in the audience oh don’t worry he gave you seven thumbs up
here’s a question as an alien pretending to be human are you planning to engage in any postprom mating rituals with amy
not always unless your date drives a van with an air mattress then always
well if it’s part of the prom experience then i’m open to it
i may be an alien but i have urges if amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space well then i will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin i’m not the best at reading facial cues but i can see that you’re a little turned on
you know if you’re not gonna learn how to do this they make some pretty good clipons
bruce wayne doesn’t wear a clipon
bruce wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him
his name is alfred and yes he does
what are you sure it’s my first prom i want to do it correctly
i thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien
i was but penny didn’t want to you didn’t want to bernadette amy koothrappali and wolowitz didn’t want to and even i knew it was weird to hire somebody
yes i’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom including spiking the punch
you’re gonna put alcohol in the punch
oh no this is pomegranate juice it’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cellprotecting zip of antioxidants
if you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket you’d be like the toughest kid on the disney channel so anything else planned for tonight
oh everything getting our picture taken slowdancing being elected prom king pointing out that kings aren’t elected it’s gonna be off the hook
and while you’re at it i know that at this age your hormones are raging but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to
you know ’cause ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night
penny implied the same thing is this true
just relax it’s a joke you don’t have hormones
sheldon doesn’t amy look hot that’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin
oh it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades try not to touch it when you’re dancing
i can’t do this and for your information leonard the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades it grows out of the belly button on my neck
he’s right i was thinking of the lower flermin
ooh i’ll uh text stuart let him know we’re close
oh thanks it’s sally from nightmare before christmas
do you like her because you both have red hair
uh a little but more that she’s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on
did you know in the original book the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper
hey here comes stuart and his date
that’s howard’s cousin that he had sex with
she is my second cousin we were 15 i just said don’t say it
no it’s okay he told me that story a long time ago
it was our first date there was an awkward silence what was i supposed to say
oh the girls really did a nice job
aw i know i wasn’t into this before but i’m so glad i get to take you to your first prom
what makes you think i didn’t go to my prom i went
i took a little lady i like to call loneliness
oh it’s all right we ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation so…
well if i would have been there and saw you alone i would’ve asked you to dance
it was before my growth spurt
well you wouldn’t have asked me either
i would have asked you in my head on the way home while i was having a good cry
i don’t think that’s a good idea
according to an online message board i may be having a panic attack soccermom09 had similar symptoms but to be fair the twins were a real handful that day
you’re making me worry what’s going on
what’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom and there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what mr bob eubanks called making whoopee
what pressure all i said was you look handsome can you please open the door
it’s not just that leonard and penny also made comments about it and i’m not blind even i looked twice when i saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants
so i met jeanie at your aunt gladys’ she passed me the manischewitz i took one look at this punim and i almost plotzed on the kugel
is this what i sound like when i talk about india
so my mother’s okay with this
why would your mother have a problem with me and stuart
‘cause they have a weird inappropriate relationship
weirder than what you and i did in my dad’s corolla
i know i’m having the best time
why would you even come to this didn’t you know i’d be here
it was a long time ago howard
and you’re only second cousins who cares
so you knew and you brought her anyway
oh so she’s good enough for howard but not for me
yeah go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin this is his turf
well i might not have asked you to dance then but i will ask you now
i don’t care we’ll make our own music
my god who’s the dork now thank you for wearing your flats
thank you for wearing your heels
look at me dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom
want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club
i sent them a bikini shot of you years ago this is nice i kind of wish no one else was coming
i know me too but it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama
not until he stops humping his way up my family tree
sheldon this is silly i’m not missing another prom i’m going upstairs now goodbye
i really did think you looked pretty
yes so much so that i started to panic
well you can relax just because you think i look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together
were you hoping we would because it’s prom
i’m always hoping but tonight i just wanted to have a nice time with you and maybe dance with someone who has arms
of course i understand sheldon there’s something else i’ve been wanting to say but before i do i just i want you to know that you don’t have to say it back i know you’re not ready and i don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…
there’s no denying i have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite but that seems even more farfetched the only conclusion was love i know what’s happening this is a panic attack soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated
whoa whoa whoa whoa just because i love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room
okay here we go say cheese iskip say cheese iskip say cousin iskip say…
oh sorry hang on sorry on phone hey debbie i yeah yeah i’m here with jeanie okay but we’re just friends it’s yeah i got to go
this is an easy one you love this guy
come on he’s an underappreciated genius
it’s not you now think there’s a car named after him
of course there is the mini cooper ’cause it’s me
how about this he’s a poor man’s sheldon cooper
oh not fun the doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses
yeah i watched it was like the scary boat tunnel in willy wonka
did they figure out what’s wrong
yeah it’s a deviated septum the surgery to correct it is simple he’s gonna do it next week
because i can’t breathe i snore i get sinus infections
yeah back off he’s all mine
but you don’t have a lifethreatening condition why would you take the risk of surgery
sheldon it’s a routine procedure i’ve heard you complain about his snoring
yes for the first five or six years but i’ve gotten used to it it helps me sleep he’s like my mucuspowered white noise machine
sheldon i’m gonna get the surgery it’s no big deal end of story
very well i’m done talking about it
i believe it was your turn in the game
let’s see oh this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous disfigured freak
i think you could give a better clue
i don’t i’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo
i’m listening to you snore i’m wondering how i’ll ever sleep without it
if it helps you sleep then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman
really leonard insults after i spent two hours in your closet waiting for you to fall asleep
if the surgery is successful the snoring is gone and if you die during surgery the snoring is gone
it sounds like either way i finally get some rest
i have to be honest with you leonard i’m truly worried
i told you there’s nothing to worry about
well i’ve been doing some research and i’ve learned that one in 700000 people die from general anaesthesia
buddy wh do you realize that that also means 699999 people don’t die
i suppose that’s true you’re such a glass halffull kind of guy i’m going to miss that
oh so my uh parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and i can’t think of a thing to get them
damn can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years
anyway any ideas on a gift
well what are some of the things they like
they used to like going to the mumbai symphony but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in then my dad said based on their love life she should know about phoning it in
well they weren’t speaking at the time so he had a servant say it to her oh maybe i could make a gift for them i know how much you guys love the coasters i made for you
remember when i said if you went through with your surgery there was a onein700000 chance of dying
well i’ve been crunching the numbers and so far i’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphinctertightening one in 300
great timing my check sphincter light just went on
leonard what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves
well then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves i bought for you to do the dishes
for the same reason i don’t wear the apron or the hair net
you don’t but the surgeon might hmm and your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at disneyland
sheldon do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery
i do i have the drive to the hospital right here that is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs and don’t expect me to carry you i do that enough in life
buddy i i get that you’re worried about me and i i appreciate that but i’m not going to die
well i do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike
you know who else said that every cocky t rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car
if there was an asteroid strike wouldn’t you die too
i don’t know i’m smart and scrappy i think i’d find a way
tell you what the surgery’s not for a week i’ll think about it
thank you and while you’re thinking about it if you have the surgery in nicaragua during monsoon season i can practically guarantee your death
yes okay i i understand of course yes i’ll call you tomorrow bye
so i found this fencing school in burbank that has a jedi class and if you’re cool being the only adults there they said they are
dude my parents just split up
uh that was my dad on the phone he moved out
oh my god i i’m sorry i mean if you’re not up to it we don’t have to go out we can just hang here
no it’s fine it’s not that big a deal as long as they’re happy i’m happy and when i get to see them for the holidays i’ll get to celebrate diwali twice one at each house that’s double the diwali
how can i be okay i come from a broken home
the doctor said i should be out of surgery by ten
okay and sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool
he was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in he didn’t even question it
18 parts per million and he’s still doing it
don’t worry about that i’m happy to take you to work
well thank you and leonard never lets me have french toast sticks in the car i can’t have syrupy fingers but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl
although now that i think about it leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt
no but last year at magic mountain he got such a bad sunburn we had to cut him out of it
he probably got a new one finish your breakfast look there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it
i’m odd all the time everyone knows that just last night i tried to see how many fava beans i could fit in my mouth
all right don’t get upset but an earlier appointment opened up for leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now
i see take me to leonard
just go to work he’ll be fine
amy he’s my best friend and if you don’t take me i’m going there anyway
fine it’s sweet that you care about him so much
i do and i wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and i wasn’t at his bedside to say i told you so
we had a really nice swim
oh stop it i assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire
that’s for the fire marshal to determine
he wore me down and i was distracted he has on extra baby powder today
he’s gonna be all right that is sticky
come on let’s talk about something other than the surgery
that’s a good idea penny did you and leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements
i think she meant something a little happier
i suppose we could try to make it a celebration but he died so young
he’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry tough crowd
i’m sorry this is very sweet thanks
better i guess the news just hit me a lot harder than i expected
well of course i would be devastated if my parents split up
why your father barely speaks to your mother
well at least he stuck around not like your dad who just took off
as you can see we’re here to cheer you up
sorry raj do you have any sense of what happened with your folks
i think over time they started to resent each other and instead of talking about the things that bothered them they kept it bottled up and the hate just grew
it’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy but sometimes there’s muffin you can do about it you get it right
oh it’s nice you got him that
oh this isn’t for leonard no amy bought it for me
stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in
you know those confounded things make me dizzy
who told you to keep going around
there was a large plant in the lobby it kept looking like the outside
okay listen when leonard comes out he is not gonna feel great so please don’t give him a hard time
penny has a good point this is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck whatever you’re thinking just keep it to yourself
and i’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it
well i’m not making any promises not only did leonard take what i feel is an unnecessary risk he deceived me
okay the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass
the reason i was being a pain in the b is because i was worried about him and no one else was
really you won’t even say a
you bet your sweet b i won’t
obviously i care about leonard i’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him
and i’m not it’s an earthquake i knew it
sheldon it was just a little tremor
a little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy oh i don’t care for this at all oh i need to see he’s okay
sheldon you can’t go back there
can i tell you something this whole thing with raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us
what are you talking about we’re fine and raj’s parents probably split up because of raj
they always say the children aren’t to blame but come on
i’m not joking howie you heard what he said about his parents it was the little things they kept bottled up i don’t want that to happen to us
how can i convince you it won’t
well is there anything about me you’re keeping inside
i’m not answering that it’s a trap
so there are things you don’t like
and here i am in the trap you just keep talking i’m gonna chew my leg off
just tell me one thing that bothers you and i promise i won’t get mad
okay the truth is sometimes you’re too beautiful
okay okay i really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel
okay fine maybe it was a bad idea
i just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other although there are ways to improve our communication one thing i learned when i was in couples therapy was…
who were you in couples therapy with
anyway the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another
oh that’s so sweet i want to do that
okay um i love that you make me laugh
thank you and i love that you’re strong and independent
and yet i still love when you hold a door for me
i love that i’m kind of a slob around here and you’re okay with that
uhhuh and i love that i work and do all the cleaning and you’re okay with that
see i am isn’t this great
come on smile this is gonna be my christmas card
you know this is all your fault
i told you not to get the surgery
okay first of all the surgery was a success and secondly i didn’t even want you there
wow i don’t know which hurts worse my nose or my heart well i’m done speaking to you
don’t be like that you two need to talk this out
yeah ’cause you sound really funny
sheldon i’m sorry i didn’t tell you about the surgery but you were worried about nothing
oh you’re hardly out of the woods no you still run the risk of infection a blood clot the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose the minute you sneeze web i’m moving out
i never thought i’d say these words but come on nose spider
who are you kidding you were so panicked leonard was gonna die you’ll never leave him
yeah once he figures out how to work a door
i was not panicked and i am not overly attached to leonard
you were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me you love me
yeah tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain amy you’re a neuroscientist crack his skull open spray some raid in there
i love that you take pride in your looks even when i have to pee in the morning and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair
i love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink
i love that you have the confidence to speak even without giving it an ounce of thought
and i love how your hair is always on the soap it’s like washing myself with a hamster
hey guys sorry i am so late i was on the phone with my mother
pretty good she bought the book eat pray love and used it to set my father’s mercedes on fire so what’s up with you guys
we’re just saying all the things we love about each other
oh like you and i did at couples therapy
oh i ordered it before your surgery it’s the urn i was going to put you in
okay that’s morbid send it back
i can’t send it back i had it engraved here lie the ashes of leonard hofstadter he thought he was right but his room mate knew better”
that’s funny boy i’m gonna miss these painkillers
hey why did you get two i’m with stupid
hello i’m doctor sheldon cooper and welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags the final episode flagtacular i knew it was coming still scary now i’m sure you’re thinking the final episode who will stand between us and flag ignorance
i know i was thinking that is this a show on flags or mind reading
but the truth is i can no longer balance a fulltime career a popular internet show and a girlfriend
and he really does have one you jerks on the comment board
so as they say all good things must come to an end
233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on
you said you weren’t gonna bring that up
and you said you pressed record anyway please sit back relax and join us as we take our final lap as indicated by the waving of this racing flag and of course white flags can also represent surrender the stewards of gondor and the japanese minamoto clan but i’m sure you remember that from episode sixtytwo white flags who’s wavin’ ‘em and why
you know i thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring but then i found his dentures and realized it’s also gross
doesn’t professor abbott’s family want any of this stuff
i don’t think he had a family
i know you can spend your whole life working and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box
hey hey we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important
i did it’s all outdated or disproved
i don’t know this old pen kind of proves gravity when i tilt it her bathing suit falls right off
oh my dad used to have a pen like that i dated it all through sixth grade
it still feels weird just throwing away his work like this
don’t feel bad someday someone will be throwing out your work too
that someone was sheldon and the day was yesterday hey look at this dear roger to be opened upon your first great discovery love mom wow look at the date he saved this fifty years and never got to open it
roger abbott sounds just like roger rabbit
roger abbott roger abbott roger abbott oh my god leonard i know he’s dead but try it it’s fun roger abbott roger abbott
penny oh my rookie of the year
oh dan my boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine
oh look at you brandnew and already the third best sales rep
yes why don’t you come over to my table
i’ll be right there bernadette’s just parking the car
oh good bernadette cute sweet vicious little bernadette
come on she’s not that bad
oh yeah at the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the threelegged race i mean he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies
i know she can be a little intense but i swear she is so sweet once you get past all the…
hey what are you talking about
oh we were just talking about how much we love working with you isn’t that right dan
over the years here at fun with flags we’ve had an opportunity to learn laugh wonder
and yes even shed a tear or two
like when you do a twohour fourth of july spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded
how many times do i have to say i’m sorry
how about four thousand one for every domino i set up to make that american flag please enjoy these highlights
crikey what flag do we have today
and now it’s time for the speed round of flag or not a flag
fwag fwag not a fwag fwag i am cwushing this
say betsy ross what you working on
i have no idea because the story of me sewing the first american flag is unsupported poppycock
then who did sew it hmm
don’t ask me i’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck
wait that purple flag indicates that marine pests such as jellyfish are present
wow that flag is a lifesaver
no this is stop looking at my legs
not a fwag fwag fwag not a fwag fwag ugh cwap
when stuff like this gets me down you know what i like to do
sing hakuna matata like an eightyearold girl
wrong smartypants it’s everything is awesome from the lego movie
look at these notebooks they’re full of pages and pages of data he clearly spent years on this
mmm it’s just columns of random numbers toss it
well but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him what if what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne
maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with strawberries caviar oysters all good choices yeah that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties
well there’s no discernible pattern that i can see but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check
well maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer
sure we could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants
oh we could run a patternmatching algorithm against wellknown unsolved physics problems
ooh it might be a substitution cipher we could start with basic cryptanalysis
or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with
because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis do you
yeah i’m not even sure if it’s the right word
so dan you have a grandson how old is he
oh yeah i remember him from the picnic he was the one crying like a wuss the whole time
i heard he was being picked on by a mean kid
just builds character like my dad said nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and democrats”
oh i don’t know maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss
well i didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore
okay look i know what a good person you are but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh
what i’m like the sweetest person i know look at me i should be in a tree baking cookies
yes but once in a while people think you’re a little mean
oh yeah you one of those people
no no no no i think the cookie thing
welcome back our guest today is a returning fan favourite he puts the reading in your rainbow the geordi in your la forge and the kunta in your kinte mr levar burton
you do this i delete your contact information
while you watch me do it
well since you’re here i’d like to get your opinion on something in honour of black history month i portrayed george washington carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist what do you think on recording hi my name is george
you heard him leonard no it’s not racist
are we sure this is the place
the doorman said this is the right building
i think if you’re pulling up your pants you’re not a doorman knocks
uh i’ve been looking for a professor sharpe
hold on can i help you
hi we’re from the university we’re trying to get some information about professor abbott
we were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers
any chance you know what it is
yes he was always working on this
i was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system maybe an updated version of hubble’s law i keep seeing the number 90 repeating that could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy
it’s the number of calories in a yoghurt that’s his food diary
yeah he wrote down everything he ever ate he was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever
well he could have been hit by a bus you don’t know
sorry it’s not more interesting on the bright side you didn’t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years
so was there anything that professor abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment
to be honest his research never amounted to anything
you were his colleague how did your research turn out great hey this is the apartment you get when you win a nobel
well you could be very frugal i’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm
i’m not a bully i mean maybe i come off a little strong but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody
no that’s fine but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper
i did say that didn’t i
yeah you did i felt so selfconscious i had to return them
okay sorry can we just go i feel like everybody hates me
oh come on they don’t hate you all right they’re just a little intimidated all you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are
no come on you are not going anywhere all right i am here for you and we are gonna fix this together
even though your dress is ugly
well my little flagketeers it looks like the last episode of fun with flags is at an end if i could i would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you and if you touched the ground burn you i’d like to take a moment to personally thank dr amy farrah fowler who you may or may not know is the first woman to cohost a flag or bannerrelated internet infotainment show
and if i may get serious for a moment hosting this show has been one crazy ride but with all its ups and downs i wouldn’t give it up for the world except for now when i’m giving it up before i sign off i’d uh i’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag it’s good for times like this good night
well that’s it that’s the end of roger abbott
and we still don’t know who framed him
i still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing
i guess the sad truth is not everyone will accomplish something great some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life
that’s a nice way of looking at it
yeah for you not for me i went to space i’m covered
you know what this bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement let’s make a pact when one of us gets their first big breakthrough we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting professor abbott
then of course rubbing our success in sheldon’s face
oh well that’s the best part
dan could i talk to you for a minute
just want you to know i didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson
no it’s not penny told me that everyone’s scared of me
what what why would she say that you know she drinks right
no she’s right and i just want you to know that from now on i’m gonna be much more sensitive i don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me
oh well okay then uh one thing i’ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee
no problem when does that start
who’s been paying for my coffee
yeah it comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse
what else don’t i know about
uh well you know your private bathroom
that was supposed to be for the whole floor
no no it’s okay it only really affected wheelchair kathy and she’s back in the hospital now so it all worked out
well then maybe you shouldn’t have named her wheelchair kathy
oh my god i thought everybody liked me but i’m just a monster
but a cute one like that uh eyeball guy in monsters inc
no i’m the worst i’m a terrible person
come on don’t cry it’s okay
it’s not okay how can i even work here anymore
it’s fine we don’t mind paying for the coffee
i can’t let you do that
maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office
i guess that would be all right
see you don’t have to be mean to get what you want
you’re right now where did we land on my bathroom
how come you’re up so late
i posted the last episode of fun with flags hours ago and not a single person cared enough to comment all that effort for nothing
mm i know how you feel i spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that raj took when he thought no one was looking
it’s not the same thing i don’t think you know how i feel at all
hmm you do get me someone left a comment
too bad your show is done i kind of liked it leonard did you hear that oh the people are heartbroken i can’t take this away from the world fun with flags is back
oh no i’m not going to drink it i just wanted to hear the pop yeah i knew it was coming still scary
knock knock knock levar burton knock knock knock levar burton knock knock knock levar burton
ugh what are you doing here
you told me not to call and i didn’t know how else to give you the good news fun with flags is back and you can be in the next episode
wil wheaton said get a gate i don’t know why i didn’t get a gate
you at least listen to the premise since you were born in germany i thought we could talk
hey how are things going with your parents
you know speaking of attorneys if i ever needed a lawyer i would not hire shehulk
you know what that was almost on topic i’m gonna say good job sheldon
yeah she works at a law firm in new york
yes but she’s the only monster at the firm between you me and the wall i think she’s an affirmative action hire
anyway dad’s gonna be here in town so i won’t be able to do christmas dinner this year
if you’re not up to hosting christmas dinner i’m happy to do it you can even bring your father
i’ve always wanted to do a traditional victorian christmas parlour games goose and figgy pudding
ugh english pudding you get yourself all excited for pudding and here comes a cake with raisins in it i’m not going
i don’t hate you i love you
well you call it love but it has a lot of raisins in it
amy good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme i gave up when no one cared about my tom hanksgiving
i think a victorian christmas sounds nice
you know the best part of working in the clean room no allergies check it out oh that that that’s a lot of oxygen
we should get going to amy’s
can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles and here we are building our own multiwire detector like a couple of badasses
i know if we were still single we’d be tripping over all that booty
ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag oh no
how the hell did a pigeon get in here
you shut the loading doors right
do you know what a disaster this is
you mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it and we just let in a flying crap machine
what do we do should we call someone
and tell them that we compromised all the equipment let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows
okay how do we catch it
well what if we turn off all the lights except for one and it’ll come to it
don’t yell at me you’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling
okay so if i remain calm i’ll get more gems like turn off the lights
great we’re turning on each other that’s just what the bird wants us to do
not at all did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife you don’t pray for the plane to crash
can we please talk about anything else
forgive me how are you and leonard
let me tell you a story
sorry i’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other
hey leonard what’s up what how did that happen yeah okay i’ll be there as soon as i can sorry i have to run to the university
there’s been a problem with an experiment a bird got into the clean room
uh no you had a long flight you stay here and relax
relax easy for you to say your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account forty years the woman never cleaned a thing
you’re just gonna leave him here
here comes santa claus here comes santa claus right down santa claus lane vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins
bells are ringing children singing all is merry and bright so hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause santa claus is coming tonight why’d you turn it off
because in the last ten minutes santa came to town kissed mommy and ran grandma over with a reindeer i had a drunk uncle who did all those things nobody sings songs about him
maybe you’d like it more if you thought of santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children
my uncle was accused of that too it turned out to be legal in oklahoma
okay new subject let’s talk about presents what did you get amy
come on sheldon you have to get her something
why should i she knows that i don’t like christmas and yet every year she forces me to celebrate it not only am i going to this foolish dinner against my will at the christmas tree lot there was mistletoe and she kissed me under it in public like we were the stars of a tijuana sex show
she’s just excited about the holidays
yes and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all maybe it’s time i teach her a lesson
hmm it’d have to be something heinous something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me oh i’ve got it this is good
i’m going to buy her a present
yeah you’re gonna have to walk me through that
with giftgiving there’s an implied social contract if i show up tonight with a present and she doesn’t have one for me she’ll feel terrible
yes maybe she’ll feel so guilty she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again
so your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present
that’s right so stay on my good side or i’ll get you a little something too
okay here’s the plan i’m gonna put the food in the bag and when he lands in the bag to eat it we close it up
it’s all i could find it’ll work
sure if the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker
i told you my plan let’s call building services and get help
and admit that we contaminated the clean room
no admit that you contaminated the clean room
why do you keep assuming it was me
because you do this kind of thing all the time and then you try to cover it up
what about when you flipped the mars rover or lost koothrappali’s dog or almost drove off with that baby
again it looked like my car and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys
fine put the slim jim in the garbage bag
well what if you said it without sounding so condescending
i can try but your plan has the words garbage bag and slim jim in it
oh genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a slim jim
should have put it in the bag first
so if you don’t mind me asking do you think you might start dating again
it’s much too soon for that why do you know someone
no but if things don’t work out with me and leonard i’ll give you a call wait how much do you talk about star trek
okay let’s get this victorian party started i’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play
well there’s a fun one called ball of wool you take a ball of wool and you put it right in the centre of the table then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off
you know what i think your problem is you’re jealous because you and i used to be best friends until koothrappali came along
and you found somebody you could push around
you know maybe i’m best friends with raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me
i said stay out of it
no no no no raj go ahead say what you were gonna say
all i’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now it it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting now i have to hear the two of you and who cares who’s smarter if it’s leonard or me or you know it’s christmas let’s say it’s howard
well if you’re so smart you get the bird out
no you’re the one who let him in
how do you know it wasn’t leonard
no it’s not good enough it has to be perfect
i think the nicest gifts i’ve got from howie show how well he knows me
hmm let’s see what do i know about amy she loves medieval literature chaucer’s her favourite and her eyes sparkle when she watches old french movies i enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along
wow you really do love her
i do now let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless
certainly doesn’t feel like it does it
you know my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time
oh i guess that’s where raj gets it from
well he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young i was always working
hey you know raj is dating a doctor who works a lot him and his mom have a type you you got to laugh at that right no all right
all right let me see if i’ve got this straight a picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate christmas
santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough
there’s an argument for that but i want to make sure
okay on the count of three i’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne howard you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit raj you hold open the curtain so he can fly out
are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket
do you want the fire extinguisher
uh you have to take the pin out
you miss the blanket now don’t you
it was an accident oh my god oh my god
oh no i killed it oh not again
what do you mean not again
when i was ten i was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay i mean i tried to bring it back to life with electricity but it just caught on fire the worst part was it smelled delicious
uh guys i found an article here that says you can do cpr on birds
i’m not doing it you killed him you do it
no i need to do it this is on me
okay mouth over beak and light chest compressions
don’t blow too hard if you pop him i will vomit
i am tasting a lot of slim jim
oh he blinked his eyes he’s alive
i might argue a hanukkah miracle but i’ll take it come on little guy let’s get you outside get the curtain
someone should really close that loading door
well that’s that the room’s compromised they’ll have to change all the filters probably shut it down for weeks
you were right go ahead call building services tell them it was my fault
no we’re both to blame you know let me take the heat on this one
yeah just leave me out of it you know if they come here and see crap everywhere they’re just gonna blame the indian guy
hey i’m sorry we’re still here is everything okay
it’s kind of boring although it did get exciting for a minute when amy inhaled a wool ball how much longer do you think you’ll be
i don’t know there’s still a bird in here we are gonna get in a ton of trouble
honey it’s christmas eve who even knows you’re in there
no our names are on the signin sheet
so erase them and walk out
she says take our names off the signin sheet and leave
mmm amy that pudding was delicious
oh oh in that case it was pretty good
you feeling okay you hardly touched your goose
it smelled too much like blue jay
can i help you clean up
oh you heimliched a ball of wool out of me you’re good
uh what do you say we exchange gifts
oh sheldon we didn’t bring any
i thought you hate giving gifts
yeah i do which is why i got amy this
oh not just something no it’s from the heart it’s holidaythemed and i swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it
look at you on santa’s lap that’s so sweet
of course it is it’s the perfect gift how are you feeling right now guilty sad wishing you were jewish
oh really well how about now on recording happy holidays to my dear amy i hope you treasure this as much as i treasure you not on recording and you got me nothing christmas is ruined let’s never speak of it again well this was fun
actually i did get you something
well you got me something here
they’re your meemaw’s christmas cookies i called and got the recipe
they’re perfect it tastes like her hugs
i can’t believe this you’re happy i’m happy well maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… get your hand out of that box
okay the next game is called hot boiled beans
one person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper hurry up before it gets cold
if you people think this is better than tom hanksgiving you’re all crazy
what colour would you like to be
well i’d like to be green but you know you always take it
that’s not true any colour’s fine with me yeah i could be aa combination of blue and yellow
oh good news we ordered lunch so we can all stay here and play lord of the rings risk
sheldon we said that we would play games with you tonight
oh no we’ll still be playing it tonight this game can easily take eight hours
sweetie you really thought i’d want to do this
well did you tell him that
did you say it out loud with words
i don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game
yeah well you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of middle earth now including the haradwaith territories
i will literally race you to the car
no no no come on don’t leave just try it
no we’re always doing what you guys want just once it’d be nice if you did something we wanted
you know they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into
yeah we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary
oh my favourite george lucas can talk all the way through star wars i say one word and i’m banished to the kitchen
yeah today amy and i are deciding what we’re all gonna do
you got it you girls are in charge
fine now that we’re not playing you can be green
and since you’re green this time i can be it next time
all right let’s see what’s something fun the guys would never take us to do oh i know we could go horseback riding
i actually can’t my hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees i rode a very thin pony once on the first bump just popped right off
all right well what do you want to do
there’s a craft and folk art museum on wilshire
well that’s wilshire’s problem come on you know there there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate
hang on why do we have to hate it
i did not force you to go to that
you walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie i went so you didn’t get beat up
i wasn’t gonna get beat up
you were but somehow i held myself back
you know what you could make us do iceskating the cold air will trigger leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my wellknown fear of getting flattened by a zamboni
now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable
well i’m sorry leonard i’m a problemsolver it’s what i do
i actually can’t go iceskating i have unnaturally brittle ankles
is there any part of your body that’s normal
oh my god oh my god oh my god
no i’m not okay i feel like i’m gonna jump out of my skin
i told you not to wax down there it’s itchy when it grows back
i’m worried about the new horizons space probe
nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about pluto and it’s finally close enough so this morning it turned itself on
we hope the signal has to travel over three billion miles so it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived
now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice
space ice is no joke i can’t even watch frozen anymore
ooh the philharmonic is playing beethoven downtown
before you say yes it’s not the movie about the big dog
how come we can’t think of something we both want to do
because you always pick what we do and i just go along with it
ah interesting we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like and here you are doing the same thing to poor amy
you should point out the hypocrisy of that
oh that wasn’t clear try it again but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples missy
you’re making it too complicated why not stick to the basics go shopping for clothes while leonard and i sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses hmm i know i’d hate that leonard
what do you say sounds kind of perfect
it does somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it
well once again it’s what i do
oh another two hours to go the wait is killing me
i know i get it when i was in the soyuz capsule returning from the space station plummeting toward earth at 17000 miles per hour…
before you finish is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space
a story can do two things
ugh i feel like i’m gonna have a heart attack
you work in pharmaceuticals don’t you have anything you can give him
all i have is our new urine flow drug won’t help with his anxiety but it’s so strong when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack
i can’t stop thinking about it
you know worrying won’t have any effect on what happens
maybe you need to do something more productive
okay if i make this shot in the trash can the probe will have arrived in perfect working order
so in addition to being crazy you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess
the man who crashed his stationary bike
i didn’t crash it okay my playlist was too uptempo i got lightheaded and i fell off okay it all comes down to this
you happy now you can relax
what kind of scientist are you everyone knows you got to make two out of three
that’s easy for you to say your chair’s not facing the lingerie section boy that’s a lot of panties
you guys comfy this might take a while
i don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes
no you’re right we should do what you do have our mom send us pants from the walmart in houston
they have a man there who understands my personal style
uh i’ve got some bad news there’s no cell service in here
oh well that’s all right there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented
i’ll look them up son of a biscuit
no it’s not fine what kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have wifi i’m going to call their corporate office son of a biscuit
let’s see my armies are going to attack the shire from buckland and i roll a five and a three
okay and to defend i roll two sixes i win
boy doublesixes again you know if i hadn’t seen it with my own eyes i wouldn’t believe it i wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here
i don’t know but the girls do a lot for us it’s the least we can do
oh that’s true i suppose it’s only fair we make compromises
look at you being all mature
i don’t know why you’re so surprised if there’s one thing i know about after living with you for so many years it’s how to compromise
i i’m sorry you make compromises for me
on earth in our lives that that that we’re living
oh yes i just yesterday you had a a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch did i say anything no i compromised and kept my mouth shut like you should’ve because everyone was laughing at you
that is not a compromise a compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how
oh i learned how amy taught me
what then then why don’t you do it
uh well it’s scary and sometimes i get the pedals mixed up but more importantly driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose i can’t take that away from you so what do i do oh come on i’m practically feeding you the answer i compromise
hey uh thanks for keeping me company
i’m happy to i think getting out of the apartment will do you good so where we headed
if it’s okay with you i’d like to go to temple
buddy trust me you don’t want to convert to judaism i mean i know i make it look cool but it’s not all briskets and dreidels
oh okay it’s not like indiana jones and the temple of doom right some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out
dude that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians
i’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious
well because i’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple you never talked about believing in god and last diwali i watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a brazilian steak house
religion is a very personal thing i do go to temple i just i don’t talk about it
so as a scientist you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you
that is so offensive does everything you know about hinduism come from indiana jones
no there’s also apu from the simpsons
well lots of scientists believe in god okay newton uh faraday uh pascal all were believers even einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that god does not play dice with the universe
well of course he believed in god he slept with marilyn monroe
actually there’s no proof of that
you believe in your religion i’ll believe in mine
uh not really a great outfit for work unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division hey can i ask you something
do i really force you to do things you don’t want to
i promised myself if i ever got friends i’d do whatever they said really i’m lucky you found me before a cult did
well you know that was a long time ago you’re a different woman now you’re smart you’ve got great friends you’ve got a boyfriend you’re pretty you have zero fashion sense but anyway tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want
absolutely you name it we’re doing it
basket weaving at the craft museum
oh here’s another one i wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an a but i don’t put it there because i don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast
is it my turn to talk about the compromises i make
i wasn’t done but go ahead he said compromising
because of you i’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home i’m not allowed to whistle i don’t wear shoes that might squeak
well you’re a physicist not a circus clown
sheldon do you realize i don’t live with the woman i love because of you no other reason just you
yes it’s true the last time i brought it up you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away
well given my history on the subject t seems a little reckless to bring it up now
you have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you it’s exhausting
you know what you think you’re so tolerant but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot yeah you think that i don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls but i do hmm i have excellent peripheral vision on a good day i can see my ears
sheldon i i’m sorry if i hurt your feelings i’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while
well i’m sorry too and if you want to live with penny then i think you should
yes yeah just put on your squeaky shoes and eeeeeeeee your way out of my life
i’m not upset i’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it
i’m not leaving your world i’m just talking about living across the hall
i understand either way i want you to know that i’m aware of how difficult i can be so i just want to say thank you for putting up with me
how are you guys getting along what why are there tears
everything’s fine we just started talking about living arrangements
are you crazy you know he’s a flight risk
that’s exactly what i told him
sheldon we know this is a sensitive subject and leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready
well what if you did it gradually
all right how about we start with two nights a week i live with penny
how about one night and i let you whistle
there we go compromising again we really are the best
here we go my first hindu temple
you see behind the fountain that tower that looks like a pyramid it’s called a sikhara it symbolizes the the connection between the human and the divine
huh i always thought it was mini golf
yeah just uh is there anything i should know before i go in
really so every other place you’ve been you thought this was fine
i know you’re under a lot of pressure so i’m gonna let that pass
sorry you’re right i’m so stressed but you know what whenever i walk into that temple i realize that whatever happens it’s okay we’re all part of an immense pattern and though we can’t understand it we can be happy to know that it’s it’s working its will through us
whether you call it god or the universe or the self we’re all interconnected and that’s just a beautiful… son of a bitch that guy just dinged my car s seriously you were just gonna drive away like my life isn’t hard enough right now a space probe might be destroyed my parents are going through an awful divorce the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs
you saw her she looks like jim carrey from dumb and dumber
raj you just got a text the probe turned on it’s fine
i thought this was gonna be boring but it’s actually kind of fun
don’t tell amy that we’ll be here every sunday
sheldon that really is an excellent basket
it’s not a basket it’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century china
well roomie it’s only one night a week but it’s a start
i know i’m really proud of sheldon
yeah i’m proud of him too
can you keep it down some of us are trying to sleep out here
okay we’re headed out see you later
before you leave could you test these noisecancelling headphones
hello can you hear me sheldon i haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years
uh bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada
your george lucas autograph is really a me autograph
yeah once i was too lazy to walk across the hall so i used your toothbrush
ooh and one time when you were asleep amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever
aw now i’m sad i didn’t hear it
so what do you need the headphones for
well i’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay i’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment see i’ve got uh my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature uh i have fleecelined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty and then oh last but not least this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade richard feynman
is that why you had to take him to office depot last night
i don’t want to talk about it there the place is all yours
oh i will nothing more fun than a paradigmshifting evening of science
and you thought it was soaping me up in the shower
okay here we go proton decay proton decay time shift proton decay proton decay time shift proton decay proton decay
how could there be with these constant interruptions
i love him but if he’s broken let’s not get a new one
what are you doing it’s time to go
i’m not going to work today and would you like to know why
ah you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day
call me if you need anything
i’ve been cooped up in here too long maybe i need some fresh air
you sounded in distress i was worried something unpleasant was happening to you like a murder or spontaneous coitus with leonard
oh i’m just doing this awful workout i hate it
well if you hate it then why are you doing it although i could ask the same question about coitus with leonard
i don’t know i guess i like that i hate it it makes me work harder
the exercise sheldon shouldn’t you be getting ready for work
i’m not going would you like to know why
uh you’re sad about not getting anything done last night so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it
boy i’m not nearly as mysterious as i think i am
i invented a game you want to play
it’s called emily or cinnamon i give you actual quotes i’ve heard raj say and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog
go ahead make fun you can’t embarrass me i’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater
okay who was he talking to emily or cinnamon i want you to know the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it
i may not be liking this game so much
okay emily or cinnamon check it out i got us matching sweaters
we all got the christmas card cinnamon
you know a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet it’s not strange
ooh emily i heard him say that to emily hey i thought you were staying home
yeah i was but after talking to penny i realised something i first she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are and second the reason i may not be progressing in my research is i’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself
according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson in order to maximize performance one must create a state of productive anxiety so i’d like to ask you all to do something for me keep me on my toes just throw me off my game essentially go out of your way to make my life miserable
hold on what’s in it for us
33 seconds okay that’ll be our baseline
you know i don’t want to tell you how to do your job but when a mouse completes a maze it gets a food pellet
it also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers
and his last meal was a food pellet you’re a monster
all right next we’re gonna introduce an anxietyinducing stimulus measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problemsolving rate
very well and good luck i’m a pretty laidback guy
ready begin why’d you pop it
i’m sorry i was aiming for your heart
look i know you don’t like it but that’s the point of the experiment i need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone and you said no to tickling polka music or watching me eat a banana
my mother said that’s how good girls do it
perhaps this was a waste of time
sheldon you’re a remarkable scientist just be patient i’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for
and if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery what does it matter
only do solid research i come to you for help and you insult me i thought the least that you would do would be…
look your anxiety levels are right in the zone
really oh that’s fantastic now wait they’re dropping why are they dropping
oh that is infuriating ooh look they went back up again terrific oh no they went back down
all right guys what game do you want to play
let’s see how about emily or cinnamon
you know what i think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things maybe the truth is you’re jealous of all my relationships
oh maybe i am who wouldn’t want to be the girl or possibly dog to hear the words you’re so lucky you have the shiniest hair
that is a tough one uh i know he brushes both of them
gentlemen i have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me i’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners from now on when i make an assertion i need you to challenge it
so you just want us to disagree with whatever you say
and you think that’s going to help
well i don’t think that’s gonna help at all
oh no it will see by keeping my mind engaged i’ll become more focused
stop fighting me on the premise it’s scientifically valid i’m going to advance propositions i just want you to challenge me
i don’t think that’s what you want at all
why of course it’s what i want why would i say it’s what i want if it’s not what i want
because it is what you want and it’s not what you said
i ask you for one simple thing and you can’t even do it
you guys are the worst thank you i think that was helpful
so whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to hawaii
that would be so romantic for you and leonard
yeah clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector
if i were going to hawaii i’d spend all my time at the keck observatory did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the hubble
really want to go to hawaii
knock knock knock ladies knock knock knock ladies knock knock knock ladies
well as you may know i’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels and i thought what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk
what exactly do you think goes on here
well conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex you know who has the best cervix which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now men’s buttocks and how you want to pat and squeeze them
we were talking about penny’s job
and how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated cranky and crampy continue
sheldon we are just people we talk about the same things you guys talk about
you talk about if werewolves can swim see leonard says yes but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten what do you think
let’s just talk about our periods
no hold on all canines instinctively know how to swim why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities
well they’re not a hundred percent wolf they’re a werewolf that’s only part wolf it’s like comparing apples to oranges
thank you oh and technically it’s apples that turn into wereoranges when the moon is full hey this is fun we should do it sometime when you aren’t all pms’ing bye
oh uh i need to keep my anxiety at the right level so i’m using darth vader the joker and godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot uh i tried including taylor swift in the mix but turns out i love her
well at least listen to it through headphones i’m trying to sleep good night
boy taylor was right haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
you’ve been working so much lately i’m glad you didn’t forget about date night
maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me
i can do both my brain is working at optimal capacity i can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time
sheldon sheldon i’m worried about you you’re not eating you haven’t slept in days and to be honest that cap is starting to smell
i know it’s replaced godzilla as my principle source of anxiety
okay so it’s one vote emily one vote cinnamon penny you’re the tiebreaker
it’s just so perfect that we’re both libras
wow this is hard i’m gonna say cinnamon
that was the last one i promise we won’t play any more
thank you ‘cause if she ever found out it would hurt her feelings
that can’t be much fun for amy you know at work today he tried his first red bull
he chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car
don’t you think you should make him stop all this
i don’t know he’s not really hurting anybody
you didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment
he is getting a lot of work done he had a pretty interesting take on proton decay
wow if he cracks that it’s a game changer guys it’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe
hmm it would okay back to emily or cinnamon how can such a little girl eat such a big steak
sheldon i want you to take that cap off
that nagging tone is helping my anxiety yeah but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill that’d really put the zipadee in my doodah
i’m sorry but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night
sheldon stop it i’m not kidding take the cap off and put the notebook away
but after months of struggling i’m finally making progress
you don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive
or do i hmm sir isaac newton wrote his principia while convinced he was an armadillo
yeah well maybe it is maybe it isn’t i have been hallucinating lately
sheldon this has to stop you need to get some sleep and take care of yourself
amy i have gotten more done in the last few days than i have since i made the switch to dark matter what if i stop doing this and it all goes away
your thoughts and ideas come from you not from your anxiety
hmm perhaps but i’m not taking the cap off
it’s one thing to make yourself miserable but you’re making everyone around you miserable too now i’m telling you for the last time take the cap off
oh really what if i don’t and before you answer that can i have my dessert
and then she threw me out me her very own boyfriend when all i’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in
yeah well women what are you gonna do
i knew you’d understand armadillo isaac newton
hey what are you trying to pull the president of science isn’t in here
you lie down he’ll be here in a minute
okay hey i thought you were trying to trick me
no no comfort is the enemy you know what’s comfortable slippers and blankets and panda bears imagine a panda bear with richard feynman’s face on it warm up the car leonard it’s poster time
no i don’t want to go to sleep you can’t make me
yeah darn straight you can’t try to tell a grown man to go to sleep
you know he can be a lot of trouble but when i see him lying here asleep like this i just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face
you look like you got some rest
oh i’m feeling much better and i’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels
i turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out so my levels right up there
hey guys mind if emily joins us for lunch
so i hear you guys have been playing a little game
well um we were just kidding around
well you may think it’s funny that raj is sweet and sensitive but i think it’s sexy ugh why is there dog hair in your mouth
so tell me about your day how’s it going with the particle detector
yeah i listen to what you say you’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium
you know when you talk like that i want to take you right here on this table
and you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight so how’s the detector going
well it’s tricky working with superfluids whatever container you put them in they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own
kind of like sheldon’s ant farm
exactly except you don’t have a lunatic running around yelling i fed you sugar water why are you biting me come on this is boring you really want to talk about this
no i do i didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing
okay well this is cool uh there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities viscosity density surface tension…
hey if you’re pausing for dramatic effect i’d keep it moving
no no people don’t talk about surface tension if you imagine our threespace as the surface of an ndimensional superfluid bubble… this is exciting this is really exciting i have to go find sheldon
okay well if you find him use the kitchen island that coffee table will not support both of you
which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negativeenergy density as spacetime so what do you think what do you think so what do you think
what is it wrong have you seen it somewhere else
i know this isn’t my area and i could never do the math like you can but could this be something
well you could have set newton’s gravitational constant to one and ugh the whole thing reeks of blueberry you know i can’t stand these scented markers
no one told you to taste them come on is is this good or not
i like it i think you’re on to something
you do you’re not messing with me
not at all in fact i have got something for just such an occasion i was starting to think i might never get a chance to give it to you good job
not just a sticker that is a sticker of a kitty saying mewow
for a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump
you worked out all the math
oh i did more than work out all the math i wrote a paper
you wrote a paper on my idea
i wrote a paper on our idea
when did my idea become our idea
when i mixed it with sheldony goodness and cooked it in the easybake oven of my mind
this is good our idea is really good
well the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright
you know if no one’s thought of this yet this could be a big deal
only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the preprint server i have it ready to go but i wasn’t gonna do it without you
wow it’s all happening so fast should we just sleep on it
we could but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch
my name is right on there with yours that is a surefire mark of quality that might as well say directed by joss whedon
come on click the mouse with me
i don’t want to talk about it
okay movie night what do you want to watch
whatever happened to that ape movie you were in
oh god probably nothing i think i saw the director twirling a sign outside the verizon store
‘cause it would be fun to watch
well now we have two reasons
fine but i’m telling you it’s terrible
well maybe it turned out better than you think
sheldon this is superfluid helium put this in your mouth your tongue will freeze and break off
hey your paper got mentioned on the quantum diaries physics blog
uh it’s basically a summary of the theory but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board
let me see let me see one calls it insightful and innovative we’re insightful and innovative
oh nice to meet you mr insightful
oh the pleasure is mine mr innovative uh another one says the concept shows some real outofthebox thinking do you hear that mr outofthe
how are you today mr canyoubelievethesejackasses
okay okay uh the analogy between spacetime and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false i wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish
it’s anonymous and user name general relativity
uh don’t lower yourself to their level
look i am simply going to defend our work scientist to scientist and failing that suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and nonhuman lovers
sheldon my name’s on that paper too there’s no upside to doing this
upon review i’ve changed my mind about the cooperhofstadter hypothesis that spacetime is like a superfluid in fact it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory maybe spacetime is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket much like cooper and hofstadter
you mess with the bull you get the horns i’m about to show this guy just how horny i can be
doctor please help me i think i might be turning into a killer gorilla
why do you think you’re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla
because regular gorillas are vegetarians and i just bit the fingers off your receptionist
careful she’ll bite your fingers off
okay well i’ve been poking around the internet and i think i found something we’ll enjoy watching even more
oh just a video of bernadette in a beauty pageant
okay i learned my lesson making fun of people is wrong
i haven’t learned my lesson play it play it
hi i’m bernadette maryann rostenkowski from yorba linda california
you look like a talking cupcake
and you should pick me for miss california quiznos 1999 because i want to singing tell you what i want what i really really want l tell you what i want what i really really want i wanna i wanna i wanna i wanna really really really be miss california quiznos 1999
play it again play it again
well maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level
read it back one more time
my good sir we are neither crackpots nor wannabes in fact we are experts in our fields and while you hide behind your anonymity we stand behind our paper and later tonight your mother
and you don’t think that’s too rough
we’re just standing behind her it’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her
how could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants
yeah well amy writes little house on the prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the internet
sorry i had to get the spotlight off me and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training
okay we are reading that right now
we got embarrassed tonight come on
why is it about you and sheldon
oh my god it’s about her and sheldon
it’s not about me and sheldon it’s about a young woman in the 1800s named amelia and the timetraveling physicist named cooper she falls in love with
you know i’m gonna read it either way
amelia and the timetrav… found it it was just past dawn on the prairie and like every morning amelia prepared to do her chores except something about this morning felt different
why why did it feel different
maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field a man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings
you know there was a time when i was alone and had no friends i’m starting to miss that
he still hasn’t responded what’s taking him so long
do you really want him to write back
yeah i do then no matter how he responds i am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh really
i’ve uh created some other user accounts so i can post positive comments about their paper
this wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off
no you have to read it how dr angus mcdougal of the university of edinburgh would this wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off
he wrote back cooper and hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper it should come as no surprise given they work at cal tech essentially a technical school where even the physicists are basically engineers engineers do you know how insulting that is
guys this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you
yeah but it’s still so aggravating
yeah well all the other comments said really nice things focus on those
yeah dr dmitri plancovik of moscow university said dis paper great i love it more than wodka
i’m done hiding from bullies i’m taking this into the real world
i told him we’ll meet him facetoface anytime anywhere
are you crazy you don’t know who this person is delete that
oh okay okay calm down skype tone it’s him he’s trying to video chat perhaps i shouldn’t have taken this into the real world
“time travel i don’t understand” said amelia cooper stared at her ‘which word don’t you understand time or travel”
wow even in your fantasies sheldon’s kind of exhausting
he’s like that in the beginning so she can change him it’s called good writing and wishful thinking
it stung amelia when he spoke to her this way in her little oneroom schoolhouse she was always the smartest student regularly besting the boys in her class but this was no boy in front of her this was a man
cooper told amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold like computers and living past 30 he asked her if she had any questions all she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers but she was too afraid to hear the answer
so instead she asked if in the future montana ever became a state
in the 1800s that was considered flirting
i’m so sick of people being mean on the internet
well i think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face
interesting i can’t think of a single thing i wouldn’t say to someone’s face
you know what at least you guys did something you know you you had a theory you wrote a paper you made an actual contribution all guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work
he’s right i say we call this person back we’ve got no reason to hide
all right do it call him let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished
click it with me one two three click
oh brother you should see the look on your faces
you really didn’t like our paper
i like your paper very much the premise is intriguing
then why are you attacking us
if you were sitting in a chair for 40 years you’d get bored too anyway got to go i promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework ciao
stephen hawking liked our paper said the premise is intriguing
good to see you again mr stephenhawking likedourpaper
and you as well mr ourpremiseisintriguing
how do you do mr i’lladmitthat’sprettycool
yeah you keep setting me up for failure
with a heavy heart amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine she regretted giving cooper the part he needed
because she wanted him to give her the part she needed
what no i really want to know what happens and bernadette really really really wants to know what happens
you’re just making fun of me
i was just kidding i’m sorry and the story’s really good
no it is does he stay do they kiss does she find out about montana
fine as cooper prepared to depart tears filled amelia’s eyes he took her hand in his and said “i can’t stay but i will never forget you” he brushed his fingers against her cheek then quickly stepped into the machine “please don’t go” she whispered but it was too late the engine hummed to life
she turned away wiping her eyes she couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around it was cooper
“what about the future” asked amelia he looked deeply into her eyes and whispered “there is no future without you” he pulled her in close she began to tremble all over she felt his warm breath…
you will not believe what stephen hawking just said
given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire draw the water from the well and heat it it would be rude to complain but since you asked it’s a little nippy
i can fix that i couldn’t help but notice your unusual undergarments
they’re not undergarments they’re underoos where i come from they’re known as underwear that’s fun to wear
and what’s the significance of the spider
oh that represents spiderman he does whatever a spider can
there’s a lot of rhyming in the future isn’t there
you’re right this is even weirder than i thought
you want me to stop reading
as he stood for amelia to dry him…
so tell me cooper are the ways of physical love different in the future
i’ve invented a science joke would you like to hear it
how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb
who cares he stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke
of course that’s how you know it’s a good joke it not only entertains it informs
uh barry uh how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb
did you know edison didn’t actuawy invent the wight bulb
just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for amy
your idea weawy hewped me out my wightcone quantization paper’s onwine alweady the wesponse has been amazing
well that’s fascinating i can’t wait to read it
oh no me as well uh please email it to sheldon at bazinga dot biz why dot biz because i just gave you the business and also bazinga dot com was taken
anyway thanks again cooper suck eggs
since when do you help out barry kripke
well i’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity and i thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory it’s not a big deal
oh really when i was doing string theory and hit a dead end why didn’t you try to help me
i did you said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away that leaves two frogs
that’s pretty funny that does sound like me but that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along
sheldon we’re all scientists i helped out a fellow colleague you’re being petty
i’m being petty you know barry and i have a professional rivalry you heard him he told me to suck eggs if we were friends he would have suggested i suck something more pleasant why are you laughing did you learn something
okay ma say hi to aunt gladys yeah i love you too bye
your mom having fun in florida
mmm she loves it she finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are anyway she wants us to go to the house and check in on stuart because he might be lonely
well i’m her son how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if i’m lonely
yeah well sometimes you work late
i know you don’t like stuart being in the house but the store’s about to reopen i’m sure he’ll get back on his feet
that would be great i’d love for things between me and mom to get back to normal
well normal’s a strong word but sure
if i was okay i would’ve said hello and not the much more ominous hello
did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top too
no she helped barry kripke make an advancement in string theory
oh that sounds like a good thing
well it would be except that i left string theory because i decided it was a dead end yeah and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong my rival no less i’m sorry you had to see that
i’m sorry i didn’t have a camera
why would she do this to me
well i’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose besides aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science
no i said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science
all right well if i’m understanding this right and all she did was help out another scientist i’m thinking you might have to let this one go
ugh let it go i have heard that my whole life every time something upsets me somebody says let it go you know like it’s my fault and it’s not okay to feel the way i feel
i don’t know what to tell you i mean why don’t you talk to her
is that all you have shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go gee penny life’s giving me lemons what should i do
well you could shove them somewhere
yeah you should have burned it down years ago
i keep telling you i didn’t burn it down
we know we know because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime
you really did a nice job
and thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom’s through all this i couldn’t have done it otherwise
i appreciate that and i’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture
yeah she said i could use it doesn’t it look great
not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs
why don’t you just clean out the whole room take the string art clown i made her in third grade and the ribbon i got in swim class for putting my face in the water
what is your problem she said it was okay
well i’m her son and i say it’s not okay
some son looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art
well maybe i should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you then i could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother
why don’t we leave so you can cool off
i think that’s a good idea take him out of my store
your store my mother gave you the money to reopen i’m not going anywhere
why don’t we go get the food for the party
smart looks like we’re being helpful
mmm when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation
kripke you know of all the people barry kripke i’m so… are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you
oh give me that just out of curiosity if i were to let something go how would i do that
i don’t know just think about something else
can i think about the spiny anteater
the spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with barry kripke that didn’t help at all
you know some people try visualization
okay imagine your problems are a pen
now imagine you’re holding that pen
now open your hand and let it go
but i just got this pen it’s got my initials on it and everything look
i may have a better way that you can teach me
what if i told you that over the past few months amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab
what she didn’t give me any puzzles
boy i just can’t seem to get these scissors back together can you do it
darn it there’s something in my eye and i need to sort these coins by size can you help
penny i really want to eat this banana but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box
okay that’s great now let it go
i can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp
well excuse me amy was testing you i was rooting for you good job on that banana box by the way
why would she even do this
she’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them that’s when amy said want to make this interesting
make this interesting you bet money on me
no no we designed an experiment involving you see now isn’t that interesting
it’s not interesting it’s incredibly insulting
okay maybe this will help imagine you’re holding a pen before you go too far not a special pen with your initials engraved on it that’ll make the next part really hard
oh my that’s it get out
i don’t understand why you’re mad at me you should be mad at amy like i was this afternoon hey look at that i let it go
i think i left my pen in there
i understand why you’re upset but he worked really hard to get the store ready and it’s just furniture
it’s my mom’s furniture it belongs in the house i grew up in next to that pile of tv guides and in plain view of what for a tenyearold was a quality piece of string art
howie if the store succeeds stuart has a source of income and he can move out of your mother’s house seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that
that is a good point but i didn’t marry you for good points i married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous i’m being
this is why i had to rewrite our wedding vows
hi we’re here to pick up an order for comic center
sure let me go check on that
dude i i think that’s nathan fillion
and he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like i do i always did feel a connection with him oh i have got an idea
we’re not selling his tomatoes on ebay
no if we got captain reynolds from firefly to do a signing at stuart’s store that would be amazing
so should we go talk to him
i don’t know i mean if he’s not nice it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again
what the the guy who plays jon snow was a jerk we still watch game of thrones
he was a jerk because you rearended him
i was distracted it’s weird seeing a member of the night’s watch with a kayak strapped to his car come on hi excuse me s sorry i i don’t mean to bother you but we’re just really big fans of firefly and dr horrible
oh uh i think you made a mistake i’m not an actor
don’t say that i mean you’re not dame judi dench but you’re pretty great
oh yeah i get it you think i’m nathan fillion but i’m not so if you don’t mind i would just love to eat my lunch
come on sorry to bother you
don’t know why he’s so grumpy i got mistaken for that guy in life of pi once and i’m still floating
oh hey did you see that i i figured out how to open the door all by myself maybe i’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate
i know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests
it’s not a big deal i run tests like this on undergrads all the time if you fill out some paperwork at the university i can get you five dollars
i don’t want five dollars i want my dignity
so what are we talking like ten bucks
are you sure you’re not him uh you can tell us we’re scientists not crazy fanboys
and you’re eating alone at a deli i don’t buy it you’re not him
i just wanted to eat my lunch in peace but i really am him and thank you very much for being a fan if you want uh let’s take a picture
wait hang on if you’re really nathan fillion what’s the line from firefly about your bonnet
i swear by my pretty floral bonnet i will end you
although i knew the line doesn’t make me nathan fillion
do you want the picture or not
i want a picture with nathan fillion
ah it’s good enough for facebook
i can’t believe they did that
i know it’s so insulting at one point they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box
wait sheldon gave me a banana in a box he was testing me too
and how could a chimp even solve that that was impossible
really you couldn’t get it out
so you guys were testing us both what is the matter with you
eh what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings
that sounds like us i still don’t understand why you’re upset you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps
well except barnabas but he was on adderall
i’m sorry but it’s making me crazy
can you please just let it go
oh i can help you with that imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen while your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket
hold that thought on phone hello
how can i make this up to you
the answer’s in this puzzle box let’s see if you can open it
you could have at least warned him about the furniture
that’s what i said when we moved it
no stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own
uh that was my aunt ma took a nap she never woke up
but i think it would be comforting
when i lost my own father i didn’t have any friends to help me through it you do
i really thought he was gonna say let it go
okay thanks bernadette travel safe okay bye well they’ve booked a flight they’re heading to the airport now
still can’t believe she’s gone i mean that woman took me in if it wasn’t for her i i would have been homeless
one of us would have taken you in
yeah i don’t recall any offers but you know what uh i i’m glad it worked out the way it did because i got to know this wonderful person
yeah mrs wolowitz was pretty special when i first moved to america howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home which says a lot because those first few years she thought i was the gardener
whenever i saw her she’d say i was too skinny and try and feed me
she did that to me too
don’t take this away from me
i didn’t care for her yelling but now that i’m not going to hear it again i’m sad
if you want i can yell at you later
let’s have a toast to mrs wolowitz a loving mother to all of us we’ll miss you
i just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours
that doesn’t sound right my research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging
honey neither of us comes off good in that story
yeah i i i saw that article you’re talking about uh the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy
and then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes
oh that’s nonsense i proclaimed my love for you and the last time i looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis
other than the fact that i had it that was a magical night
raj would you ever try an experiment like that with emily
what i don’t need science to win her heart i have my family’s wealth for that
i’m telling you you can’t create love in a few hours right
oh careful you’re poking at the whole foundation of the bachelor
yeah but we don’t have to debate this we’re scientists we can conduct our own research i propose that we imprison two street people and…
you didn’t even let me finish
so you can experiment on all the apes you want but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings suddenly i’m the monster
why don’t you just do the test
in the interest of science i’d be willing to
what you’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings
please can i do it with him please
i’ve been listening to sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years tag you’re it
yeah but what if the experiment works
i’m not gonna fall in love with sheldon
that’s what i said before i knew it he pontificated his way right into my heart
uh fun fact pontificate comes from the latin word pontifex which means bridge builder or pope
just out of curiosity penny if this experiment does make us fall in love would you drive me to lake geneva wisconsin for gary con it’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of gary gygax the cocreator of dungeons and dragons
you know what i can honestly say if we fall in love not only will i drive you there i will buy you all the dragon tshirts you want
you guys are really being calm about penny and sheldon doing this thing if it were me i’d i’d be a little nervous
well even if the study’s nonsense i don’t believe in tempting fate same reason i wouldn’t use a ouija board or pick a fight with an asian guy he probably doesn’t know karate but why risk it
well that’s what the bullies at bruce lee’s high school thought and then bam karate
well are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment
the two of us could do it
yeah sure that might be fun
hang on okay given the choice of anyone in the world whom would you want as a dinner guest
hmm i can honestly say penny
oh then i choose a janitor ’cause i’m about to throw up
i’m in love let’s do something else
ooh uh emily gets off work soon why don’t the four of us go out
should we call howard and bernadette
i don’t know what time their plane gets in but let me let me shoot them a text
did he say anything about the funeral
not much but he seemed to be in a pretty good place
are you kidding me you lost my mother’s ashes
all right fine where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me the first well
i just need some information uh what’s the flight number
and can you describe the bag
um well it’s uh black there’s a red ribbon tied to the handle
the world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment
yup be right there i assume you don’t want wine
correct you’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery
what heavy machinery let’s just start
well as a texas gentleman i’m inclined to say ladies first although i’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins perhaps we should flip a coin or if you’re familiar with the rules of rock paper scissors…
question one given the choice of anyone in the world whom would you want as a dinner guest
just says anyone in the world i guess that means living
ah that’s just as well as much as i’d love to meet euclid inventor of the geometric proof he probably wore sandals and i cannot look at toes during dinner oh i know the person i’d most like to have dinner with is myself
you sure that’s your choice ‘cause i’ve had that dinner
well i haven’t and while they say never meet your heroes i just don’t see how i could disappoint who would you choose
oh i didn’t think of iron man you know maybe after myself and i have dinner we can meet you two for dessert
so what do you guys want to do
well we’re the ones tagging along you pick
ooh have you ever been to an escape room
um it’s kind of like interactive theatre except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out there’s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie
oh so kind of like what’s happening with penny right now
what would constitute a perfect day for you
uh well i’d probably sleep in do a little yoga then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing
i don’t think so leonard can’t stand yoga the beach massages or dancing
yeah well he brought a book okay what’s yours
uh i wake up uh i enjoy some french toast with butter and syrup uh then a wormhole opens and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race
who do you think made the french toast with butter and syrup
are you being polite or scared
we have to look for the clues hidden around the room
uh wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie
ooh okay let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear
mr and mrs wolowitz as far as i can tell your bag arrived in los angeles
i don’t know perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake
so some stranger has my mom is that what you’re telling me my poor mother can be anywhere in los angeles right now
i i wish i was telling you that um but the passenger could’ve gotten on an international flight
oh okay great so your entire job is to find lost luggage and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet earth
i’m sorry w would 500 frequentflyer miles help that could get you to sacramento
if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability what would it be
well not to steal from the bible but turning water into wine sounds pretty good
i don’t think you’re taking this seriously
come on i’m just having some fun with you
i believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability
fine honestly if i could have one quality i wish i could be as smart as you guys
well i can’t read people’s minds actually that’s not true i can read men’s minds but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing
when are we going to get robot eyes
well what i meant was i often misinterpret how others are feeling like i can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me you know like uh if they’re mad at something i’ve done or just in a bad mood it it’s incredibly stressful
really you always seem so confident
well i’m not and if i could read people’s minds life would be so much simpler
well now i wish i had the ability to make that stuff easier for you
wow i just felt this wave of affection for you
you sure it’s not too much bible juice
keep it down we’re working here
okay we’ve got the cipher decoded
how’s it going with the globe
we used the coordinates to locate the cities
i’m putting the city names in the grid now i’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe
solve puzzle too fast slow down
just saying no refund for finish early
sure you don’t want to go home when the bag’s returned they’ll deliver it to us
no i’m not leaving without her
the day she left for florida she asked me to drive her to the airport i was too busy and i made her take a cab i was too busy
there’s no way you could’ve known be right back excuse me
you better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman
which book are we looking for
here it is there’s a black light
oh okay uh brothers and sisters i have none but this man’s father is my father’s son who am i looking at yeah yeah we get it you want brains calm down
well if i don’t have a brother my father’s son is me and if i’m this man’s father then he’s my son the answer’s son
ooh there’s a picture of the sun over there
i bet the key’s behind it
so that’s the key to the door that’s it
we spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun
it’s like when you bought that remotecontrolled helicopter and it just flew away
sorry guys really thought the puzzles would be better
well to be fair we do all have advanced degrees
remember that before you post on yelp
if you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone what would you most regret not having told someone
so it would be today huh well i suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday
well that’s always been a secret not even amy knows
well i don’t enjoy presents and the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words george lucas director’s cut
so why did you finally tell me
the point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other
well thank you for sharing it with me i won’t tell anyone
that is so funny i never would have pegged you for a pisces
you’re making it difficult to love you right now
great news your bag was returned
oh thank god it’s okay she’s here ma’s here
ma i’m sorry i didn’t take you to the airport i just want you to know that i’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish and i promise to keep you close for the rest of my life
oh no that thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom
that’s it we’re done with the questions
all that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking
okay wait hang on bladder check we’re good to go
and begin this is kind of creepy
we’re not supposed to talk during this part
do you want to stop i know you have trouble with eye contact
well you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a formula one race car so i’m just concentrating on that plus it’s easier around people that i’m comfortable with
aw sweetie i’m comfortable around you too
of course you are i’m warm and soothing i’m like a human bowl of tomato soup
i meant more like a little brother
oh well i suppose i do think of you as a sister and sometimes a mother
just thinking about the day i met you and leonard
it was a monday afternoon you joined us for indian food
can you believe it’s been eight years
yeah and you’re still eating our food
i can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life
i remember it perfectly but i have an eidetic memory if you’re interested i also remember how much you owe us for the food
that’s it that wasn’t so bad
no it wasn’t uh now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment i think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and i’m not in love with you and psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences
well maybe but i’m still glad we did it i do feel closer to you
and i you and yes that’s how you say that yeah so given our newfound intimacy i’d say we have some hard choices to make
gary con do we fly or drive do we wear costumes and if so who gets to be gary
thank you for walking me home
i just want to make sure you get there safe
well this is me it’s been a very interesting evening
aah and after i let you be gary
i was unstoppable i mean i was i was on fire it was like my mind and my body were totally connected like like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone
admit it you’re a little turned on
as you know amy and i have been together a long time and a lot of things i never thought possible now seem possible
after a careful evaluation of our relationship we decided that the time was right to take a step forward
do you want to say it
this is why i’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice
okay that was tricky ’cause when it comes to alcohol she generally means business
well we’re we’re very happy for you
thank you acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us
no it’s true it means that we care so much about each other there’s enough left over for an eightounce reptile
after much deliberation we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet they don’t shed fur they don’t make noise
for halloween we can dress him as a cobblestone
yeah and if he ever goes berserk i know i can outrun him coincidentally that’s also why i chose you as a roommate
well congratulations who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family
well i thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here and you never get a chance to stay over so i killed her
but remember our agreement you can joke about murdering people but you have to say just kidding
and the more important thing to remember is that i’d never hurt you oh crap i have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient
that’s okay i can come back later
no no don’t be silly i won’t be gone long just stay here
okay cool oh and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while i’m here alone right ‘cause that’ll be awkward
oh don’t worry she’s in palm springs
well her torso is just kidding i put her in a wood chipper
oh dear lord oh dear lord
it’s okay you made it we’re fine
that was a lot of puppies
let’s forget about them and pick ourselves out a nice turtle oh how about this one up on the log
oh i don’t know he kind of looks like a jerk how about this one
well he’s barely moving he looks half dead
i know i like him too hi little guy how’d you like to come home with us you’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house
but that’s not your fault like you we’re taking it ridiculously slow you’ll stay with me when he’s at comiccon or away for work
or if they accept daddy’s application to live on mars
oh there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on mars and i applied to be among the first to go what should we name him you know i came in thinking seth but he kind of looks italian
you applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet and couldn’t be bothered to tell me
well based on your reaction it looks like i made the right choice isn’t that right giuseppe
hey hey listen i i have a little confession to make
aw is this your first time
no i got you something for valentine’s day and i was too embarrassed to give it to you
well ’cause i got it at the dirty store
you went to the dirty store without me
in sunglasses and a hat after i parked two blocks away
well get it get it for me
okay uh well i hope it’s fun i mean it it comes with paints and and it’s kind of creative and artistic
okay did you go to the dirty store or michaels
no no we cover ourselves in body paint and then then we get on this big canvas and do our thing
whoa that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off
you’re making fun of me forget it
no no come on i want to do it
yeah let’s you me and your very very pale feet make some art hey when you got back to this store i want to go with you
okay but it’s a drive the one i went to is in san diego
okay but you got a lot of receipts for the lego store in here
those are business expenses you can write those off
a two hundred dollar r2d2 is a business expense
oh bernie you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited on phone hey what’s up
oh emily ran back to the hospital so i’m just hanging out at her place what are you uh what are you doing
just playing video games while bernie does the taxes
what are you a little kid is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces too
she doesn’t have to i filled up on jelly beans
so uh what game are you… oh crap
i can’t get emily’s nightstand to close
she’s gonna know i was looking in it
why were you looking in it
well there’s a question i better have a good answer to before she gets back
okay calm down there’s probably something jammed behind it just uh pull it out and see what’s there
hang on oh no oh no oh god no
you know what you sound busy i’m gonna let you go
dude the whole front came off now she’s gonna know i was snooping
raj was snooping through emily’s drawers and broke one
i thought it’d be a little more just more
i’m not even sure why we were out of breath uh i mean did we move at all
maybe along the zaxis but x and y are looking pretty sad
okay come on we are not old boring people we can do better than this
uh th that’s true how late did we stay up last night
damn straight almost 1am and we weren’t even watching tv we were watching netflix like the kids do
yeah is it a comedy is it a drama nobody knows now come on we are gonna do this
yeah you get the paint i’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes and then we do this
i can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home
no one told you to poke the turtle’s face
i was playing got your nose that’s how you get children to like you
i’m surprised you even care if he likes you since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get
ugh this again amy i’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today i don’t need another one
sheldon i know the odds of you even going to mars are incredibly small but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever
so you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet
i would at least mention it before filling out the application
huh that’s exactly what leonard wolowitz koothrappali bernadette and penny said
and who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission anyway you could barely survive a tiny turtle bite
first of all this has only made me stronger but beyond that all i did was fill out an application
you know what go to mars sheldon
is there anything i can do to cheer you up
what if i play the star trek theme on my nose
okay let me see the damage
well i think you broke the dowels you’re not gonna have time to glue it back on you’ll have to nail it
does she have any pillows or wine glasses
great neither of those try a hammer
did that feel good you feel like a big man now
i was going to make you red zinger but since mars is the red planet i went with peppermint
why do you even want to do this
actually as part of the application i was required to make a short video answering that very question you want to see it
i’m dr sheldon cooper and i’d like to tell you why i should be chosen to go to mars i’m exceedingly smart i graduated college at 14 while my brother was getting an std i was getting a phd penicillin can’t take this away being in close quarters cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable in fact animals don’t trust me because i smell like nothing literally nothing during the sevenmonth space flight i can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour hey leonard is there any peanut brittle left in that can
you mean this weirdly suspicious one
i don’t get it there’s actually peanut brittle in… please go to mars
but on a more serious note the most important reason i want to go to mars is that i believe as a scientist it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward now i know that life on mars will be difficult but life here on earth is no picnic also picnics are no picnic where should we go for lunch oh i know the ground in conclusion thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime to mars
afterwards leonard blew his nose and pie came out
right there right there oh god that’s it
how did you get paint in your eye
because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles
this looks terrible she she’s gonna know
it’s fine you just need two more nails
okay where should i put them
well maybe this is what you get for snooping
you know it it’s bad enough that i have to deal with this…
fine what were you doing in there
uh w well okay look i i don’t want to lie to you i got curious i was looking around and i broke the drawer on your night stand
you were looking in my night stand
so the first time i leave you alone you snoop on me
you’ve never snooped around my apartment
come on think back it would really help if you had
i can’t believe you don’t trust me
but we’re not going to are we
what happened to snooping is wrong
howard you’re going to jail for tax fraud who cares
i mean i was on fire i i was in the zone like an athlete
sweetie i beat you at this too
so where do we want to hang it
what are you kidding we’re not hanging it
but it’s an expression of our love
and our butts not hanging it
seems a shame to throw it away
yeah we could give it to sheldon and tell him william shatner painted it
god i love you i love you so much
i think i’m gonna go home
why i really don’t understand what’s happening here
you know sheldon at any other time learning that you had plans to go live on mars would be a slow news day but a couple of hours ago we were getting a turtle and silly as it sounds i thought that meant something
amy oh why didn’t i give her sleepy time tea amy wait getting a turtle meant a great deal to me too
sure unless something better comes along
do you want me to withdraw my application
what i want is for us to be planning our future together
and in that future are we on the same planet because i’ve seen people make the longdistance thing work
okay does that planet have to be earth
are you asking me to go to mars with you
i am yeah if i’m going to a barren lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none i want you there with me why don’t we go back to the apartment and fill out your application
okay i suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting
oh i know we could be the first to plant a flag on mars we could be the first to watch mars attacks on mars we could be the first to say good lord what on mars are you talking about
you know we could also be the first people to procreate on mars
you just can’t keep it in your space pants can you
think about it if we had a family there our kids would be martians
they would wouldn’t they we could give them cool martian names and we could teach them about martian history like who planted those flags and uh where did that copy of mars attacks come from
i guess we’ll have to make a new video together as a couple
good idea and since you’ve had such a rough day i’m gonna let you throw the pie in leonard’s face
that’s okay at some point we were bound to have our first fight
well it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy but the truth is you were right and i was just angry at myself
can i ask you one thing
did you look in my closet
you promise you didn’t look in the closet
i promise why what’s in there
don’t worry about it good night
two one six four two zero one nine eight nine and that little lady is pi to a thousand places
i’d say i’m sorry i asked except i didn’t
oh look it’s the scientific american that covered the paper leonard and i wrote
i have mixed feelings about doing interviews i like the part where i talk i do not like the part where the other man talks
sheldon this article doesn’t mention leonard at all
it only refers to dr cooper and his team did you even talk about him
all i did was answer a few questions about the theory and then expressed my gratitude that scientific american doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards
why the theory he came up with just got mentioned in scientific american he ought to be thrilled
oh maybe you’re right he is kind of a lump
think about it how would you feel if you were referred to as part of leonard’s team
so you see what i’m getting at
well i don’t know we’re all groot just tell me
leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are and he was overlooked he’s going to feel bad
but it wasn’t my fault i didn’t exclude him and i didn’t write the article
remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at disneyland and they let that other kid do it
for the record that kid was a terrible choice if you cry when you drop your churro you do not have what it takes to rule england
thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff
of course i know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions my uncle was a worshipper of krishna but after he died you know what we found a statue of shiva it may not be crips and bloods okay but in india it’s a thing
well it’ll be good that you’re there howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go
well it’s hard a lot of ma’s stuff brings back fond memories
is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets
yes it reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick nobody’s looking fill your pockets with ketchup
leonard have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill
good good and your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t and i’m okay with that
actually your name is on the electric bill
oh right this is a disaster
i don’t even know what you’re talking about and i agree
okay i have to tell you something but you’re not going to like it
an article was just published in scientific american about our theory
no no they loved it they uh couldn’t say enough nice things about it
you know how the pennysaver only has my name…
they didn’t mention you in the article only me
i know it’s not fair let the anger go buddy you just you relax all your muscles except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter let’s keep those tight
it is they’re what hold back the urine and the faeces look maybe maybe you shouldn’t read it it’ll only make you feel worse
you should know i had nothing to do with that
uh at least they’re talking about the theory i mean that’s what’s important
you know you’re right yeah you know it’s like when stan lee and steve ditko created spiderman stan lee may get all the credit but steve ditko knows he was just as important even though stan lee gets to be in all the marvel movies and and he’s far richer and he’s a household name you know whereas you know you say ditko and that sounds like a company that makes dits
well i’d give more examples but well everyone in your position’s so forgettable
it’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house
yeah well i tried putting him out on the curb but nobody took him
hey just so you know the power’s out
i called they said a transformer blew it’s the whole block should be fixed by tomorrow
wait when did it go out
in the middle of the night
it’s not just food this is the last food my mother ever made this is her last brisket this is her last meatloaf this is her last i have no idea what this is but it’s the last one
no all ma’s food is gonna be ruined
well why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer
you don’t want to do that refreezing not only removes moisture but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture what i saw a teachable moment i dropped some culinary science
i’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do we’re gonna eat it
there’s like twenty pounds of food in there
all you said was i had to get rid of things you didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first
okay then how about this let’s invite everyone over to dinner it’ll be like ma’s feeding us one last time
me too oh look we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it
i mean who even reads scientific american
it’s kind of a big deal
if it’s such a big deal how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule
can we please just stop talking about it
i’m sorry what can i do
no no i’m gonna cheer you up here we go
my baby is sad and i’m gonna make him happy again
look i know shopping cheers you up but it’s just not really my thing
well what about this helicopter you control with an ipad
does it have a camera in it
it does have a camera in it
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
i spoke to the reporter at the magazine
what happened did you tell him it was my idea
thank you what did he say
he said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist
why did he think you’re the lead scientist it was my idea
you know for an extra four bucks i can have this thing here tomorrow
well i know it was your idea but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it
you know what i did it what’s four bucks
if you’re trying to make me feel better it’s not working
well then what if i told you that i added your name to the cable bill
oh that’s just as well they had me on hold for 20 minutes and i hung up knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard also wolowitz invited us all to dinner so i’m ready whenever you are
all he had was an idea
well that is an important part
oh please i have ideas all day long reverse seaworld where dolphins are allowed to pet people a new clothing size between medium and large called marge snow white retold from the point of view of sneezy why won’t doc prescribe him something we finally find out
fine then grumpy what’s he so grumpy about maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side
i’m the one who thought of it
well didn’t he do a lot of the work
yeah but now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything
and that’s why you get an ipad helicopter
is it my fault i have a much bigger reputation than he does
is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically
is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist i didn’t correct him
hey look at that pretty bird
he always needs all the attention he’s such a baby
i swear he is never ever playing with my helicopter
okay i’ll start heating some of this stuff up
oh man this is the boutonniere from my high school prom a piece of cake from my bar mitzvah
no if i find my foreskin i’m gonna kill myself
okay so we’ve got um three briskets four meatloafs one lasagna
one jewish lasagna two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each and one giant container of matzoh ball soup
ma always kept it on hand in case i got sick she thought she could cure anything with her cooking even the time i got food poisoning from her cooking
yeah i’m okay let’s get started
i’m never gonna talk to her again
should we tell everyone not to come
no i want to do this
okay well i’ll keep it together if you can
glad you guys could make it
wow it looks really pretty in here
yeah turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood
so stuart have you thought about what you’d do if howard sells the house
hi hello oh and a special hello to leonard who needs to be mentioned by name
i just want everyone to know uh tonight’s not a sad occasion
yeah we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before
good food good friends and sometime around midnight heartburn that makes you pray for death
do you need any help in the kitchen
no we got it you guys make yourselves comfortable
all right hey you two we’re here for howard right now okay
so i heard you two uh wrote a paper together how’s that going
mm and not a vegetable in sight
that’s not true we’ve got tomatoes right here
all these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight feels like we could be an 18th century french salon
indeed penny a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day
oh so it’s like the view
sheldon the view is a daytime talk show hosted by women
oh i’m aware it features whoopi goldberg she played guinan on star trek
i would like to propose a salon topic
the lead in the hunger games is a woman marvel has made tor a female
you know tor the god of tunder as i was saying is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality
certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now
it’s true at the store i had to put a seat on the toilet
we won’t know if there’s equality until female thor has a baby and the avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work
i wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of thor
okay new salon topic salons dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes discuss
i don’t believe it matters what the topic is what’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way it’s all about the execution
of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration uh new salon topic what’s more important an idea or its execution
yeah good for you leonard that’s a lovely little notion kind of like i wish i could talk to my uncle in chicago yeah now stand back while i invent the telephone hello oh hold on leonard it’s your uncle he says you just got burned
no it’s okay we’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion at least i am howard what do you think
well i guess as an engineer i lean towards execution i spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real
well said old chap i thought eloquence had died here it stands before us starting today it’ll go gettysburg address i have a dream and what he just said
oh now he’s a genius all you ever do is make fun of him and engineering
leonard please his mother just died
guys if i wanted to hear people be bitchy i’d go to my real salon
leonard lots of people could’ve had that idea but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way i did
lots of people also didn’t have that idea like everyone in the entire world except for me
oh well apparently leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world including those fighting for our freedom yeah well i don’t know about you but i support our boys overseas
hey you already ruined thor give it a rest
so i’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit
i didn’t hog anything unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it
you want some of this i’ll give you some
hey sheldon leonard living room right now
she said my name first that must kill you
i don’t know what you think you’re doing but this is a very difficult time for my husband we’re eating the last food his mother ever made and you were gonna throw it at each other like children whatever it is you’re fighting about put it aside go back in there and be a good friend to howard or there’s no dessert for either of you look at me when i’m talking to you and don’t think…
you guys ever notice sometimes bernadette sounds like my mom
i don’t think i’ve eaten that much in my entire life
it’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years took that long to walk it off
you see penny the israelites were in the desert…
right now i’m just trying to burp without throwing up
hang on physics today mentioned the paper
who cares did they mention leonard
good news i found more tums
leonard i’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at berkeley
oh i like to laugh but say it anyway
okay um what do you say to a graduate of the uc berkeley physics department i’ll have fries with that because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences
you know when they chase you out of there you only have to run faster than sheldon
are you all set for your trip
yeah i think so i just restocked the old prk
public restroom kit everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places
i don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and purell
and rubber gloves uh air freshener um noisecancelling headphones oh danger whistle um pepper spray ooh a multilanguage occupied sign uh let’s see we have seat protectors uh booties for my shoes a clothespin for my nose oh and a mirror on a stick so i can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo
you still worried some berkeley girl is gonna steal him away
yes who do you think gave him the danger whistle
would you like to play a physics car game i invented called i can’t spy it’s all the nailbiting tension of i spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum
if it’s half as much fun as one times ten to the fourth bottles of beer on the wall i’m in
i’ll begin uh i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us
will you please play the game i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us
i don’t know um if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second given the surface area of this car is about 60000 square centimetres that means 39 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos
i don’t want to play anymore
we haven’t been on a road trip in a while this is fun
we get it you won the game stop bragging
no listen we wrote a paper together now we get to go to a university and talk about it that’s pretty cool
i suppose it is in fact if you’d like to celebrate with a little music i’d be okay with that
what this road trip just got crazy
play that funky music white boy
i’m surprised you know that reference
so i put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell we just need help taking it all out to the driveway
can i be in charge of pricing i’ve been going to garage sales my whole life can you believe i got these pantyhose for a nickel
all right amy’s in charge of pricing and being 75
hey penny can you give me a hand with this
sure oh we had one of these growing up i used to play all the time
i had a table too but i didn’t have any friends so all i did was serve
you know you can leave one side up and play against it
and if i had a friend they might have told me that
excuse me why is there a sticker on this it’s my tardis from doctor who i was planning on moving it in the house
i think you just answered your own question
come on one day this may double in value and be worth half what i paid for it
sweetie we have a lot to do we don’t need to decide this right now
well i guess as long as you’re keeping an open mind
so they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music yes
and this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well
let me ask you this do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays
so it’s like the musical equivalent of russell’s paradox the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself
well then i hate it music should just be fun
making great time gonna be there pretty early
will our hotel room be ready
aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective
if we do we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks see
seems a little confrontational but all right you know we won’t be very far from skywalker ranch
oh that’s true it’s not like we can get in there
i don’t think george lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in
yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere tatooine was in the middle of nowhere hoth was in the middle of nowhere that’s code leonard he wants us to drop in
we do have time i mean we could drive by and just look at it
yes oh i’m so excited and i just can’t hide it
i’m about to lose control and i think i like it
so when do you guys think you’re gonna move in
we’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do
it’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and jewish mother tchotchke crapfest
have you made a decision about the tardis i think i can sell it if we call it big british portapotty
we’re not selling it it’s mine
you can’t just decide how about i armwrestle you
that’s not fair it’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest
you could play pingpong for it
how is that fair you grew up with a table
yes but i mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the transformers and the thundercats for control of a bra i had found in the woods
bernadette for every episode of doctor who leonard has made me sit through i will play on your behalf and send that tardis back to gallifrey where i hate that i know it belongs
that’s not fair she has upper body muscles
dude threetime sanskriti school for wellborn boys badminton champion
that’s right okay raj can play for me
ooh you just chose champions it’s like we’re reenacting the ancient german practice of trial by combat
yeah it’s also like when the mountain fought the red viper in game of thrones
leonard makes you watch that too
no no i like that show it’s got dragons and people doing it
so it’s settled the fate of doctor who’s tardis will be decided by a game of thrones inspired deathmatch on the battlefield of thundercats versus transformers
if you still have that bra i’ll give you a nickel for it
there it is it’s just a gate on a road
wasn’t even that hard to find
i know you want to get a picture
i want more than a picture i want to go in
well so do i but they’ll never let us
is that the attitude that helped you get penny
no but i don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me
there’s a speaker box drive up push the button and let’s see what happens
okay yeah what do we have to lose i’m a little nervous
well get over it confidence is key in these situations
you pushed it are you out of your mind
um uh uh uh we don’t have an appointment and and we don’t belong here but we we’re like crazybig fans i mean uh buh buh crazy for star wars crazy not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in
you’re blowing it we want to meet george lucas and become his friends and play with him
hello this speaker’s not working just pull up
all right we’ve defeated the first challenge now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate
we’re trying to get past a security guard not rescue zelda
i think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy but one quest at a time so what’s the plan
uh i’m just gonna be honest with the guy
honesty will never get us in
all right my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed
who are you here to see
uh i’m just gonna tell you the truth
we don’t have an appointment we we’re just fans of mr lucas’s work and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around
sorry guys we get this a lot can’t let you in
what if i told you that i was the voice of yoda a recording session i must attend
i’m sorry don’t listen to him we’re actually physicists we’re giving a lecture at berkeley later today we just we had some time to kill
hey listen you seem like decent guys i can’t let you in but i got some hats and tshirts i can give you
thank you so much see maybe honesty is the best… what are you doing
shedding the yoke of my oppressors you blind sad little man
i can see the ranch leonard oh it’s rustic it’s lovely i’d take a picture but people are chasing me i’m gonna make it i’m gonna make it they have tasers but they wouldn’t dare use… aaaaaaagh
come on raj you are the king kong of pingpong you are the menace of table tennis put her away ’cause i don’t have a third one yes woo
hey raj if howard can’t keep the tardis how great would it look at your place
i don’t know much about doctor who but if um you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the tardis which is pretty cool ’cause on the show the inside of the tardis is bigger than the outside but then again i don’t know much abouti doctor who
don’t listen to her you and i go way back we’re like brothers
we are we are oh no what a terrible serve sorry brother
this is ridiculous i want a new champion amy were you serious about being able to serve
uh it it’s been a long time i don’t know i’m probably pretty rusty
well if you can switch champions so can i i want raj
oh come on like you even care
i care oh wait no i don’t good luck raj
you know i thought our friendship meant more to you
do you think they’re gonna call the police
i don’t know maybe they’ll call imperial officers to take us to a holding cell on the death star
oh i think that’s below the pay grade of an imperial officer stormtroopers are really the ones who…
he’s right uh stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police
uhhuh i’m normally very nice but you shut up too
so what are you in for
honestly i just wanted to meet mr lucas and say thank you you know growing up the movies had such an impact on my life i never really fit in anywhere till i discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where i belong
oh i uh i hopped a fence and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a chewbacca statue
excuse me leonard they have a sculpture gallery
all right i talked to my supervisor and we’re gonna let you go with a warning but if you ever come back we will call the police and press charges
we understand thank you so much
no you’re not going anywhere kissy face let’s go i have to take your picture to post at the guard gate
uh one question about that picture can it be with george lucas ooh grumpy you are
okay this is the match that decides it all first to 11 wins serve switches every five points and just so you know when this started i was going to put the tardis in a discreet corner of the house but i’ve since turned mean and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it game on
except raj is gonna win isn’t that right raj
uh yeah i mean her serve was pretty good
come on get in her head be intimidating
okay uh i’m gonna own you bitch
onezero two three four fivenothing wait did you play badminton or sadminton
don’t listen to him all she’s got is a serve now grab a fresh tampon and put her away
what and that’s not offensive where’s the line
well that was an exciting 40 seconds
it was and now the serve is back to you and the game is over
you know amy i uh can’t help but wonder how sheldon would react if the tardis was at your place
don’t listen to her just hit the ball
if this doesn’t get him into your bedroom nothing will
are you still mad at me
yes we missed our lecture we were almost arrested and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed wookiee
boy some people are just glasshalfempty
the glass is empty sheldon it’s completely empty if you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst he would be dead do you know why
before i answer was he a smoker i think you’re looking at this all wrong
fine then tell me how i should be looking at it
well not only did we go to skywalker ranch we got in and no one we know can say that and for all the times you find me irritating today you got to watch someone shoot me with a taser
you did flop around a lot
i’ll take your word for it i was too busy trying not to defecate
you know when they were escorting us to the detaining room i looked through a door and i’m pretty sure i saw a display case with the ark of the covenant
and i saw jabba the hutt riding by on a motorcycle although that was right after the tasing so who can say for sure
i guess this could count as an adventure
it was and even though we’re not allowed back there they can never take today away from us unlike my sense of smell which hasn’t returned since the tasing no i got nothing
amy the daleks are right on my tail quick we need to reset the time circuits oh no i left my sonic screwdriver behind
really should have thought this through
no i’m not settle this those little animated pictures on the internet are they called gifs or jifs
well the g stands for graphics that’s a hard g so i’d say gif
the guy who invented it says it’s jif
i’m sorry do you mean the guy or the juy
well i’ll give you three guesses why i’m so irritated
something happened different from the way you wanted it
i guess news travels fast it’s true a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman and i wasn’t included
oh sheldon i’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist
yeah i bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass
you’re just saying that to make me feel better
look you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this
i was gonna say or but why bother
hey i got you a little gift
oh that’s a lot of girl scout cookies
you know me i’m from india i can’t resist children begging so how’s it going with the title to the house
great it’s all done the lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over i didn’t have to meet him i didn’t have to talk to him i don’t even know where he is
wow so you’re not curious at all
hmm what if he’s in prison what if he’s a spy what if he’s in a beatles cover band i’m just saying if he’s got your nose and haircut he’d make a killer ringo
thanks again for agreeing to do this
oh it’s cool i’ve never been on a podcast before
well you picked a good one to start wil’s had lots of great guests jonathan frakes brent spiner michael dorn gates mcfadden
i only figured that out because i’ve never heard of any of them
i deserve that i invited you on my show and i drove here
okay so this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show uh we’re gonna take some calls we’ll talk about what it was like on the set of serial apeist 2 it should be really fun
yeah so how many people listen
most people download it later but usually a few thousand people listen live
what a few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff
again right in the ears straight to the feelings
can you please pass the salt
sure it’s not like i was invited to richard feynman’s house and have anything better to do
is this how the rest of the night’s going to be
i don’t know the future do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the earth destroying feynman’s house and everyone in it
then buckle up you’re in for a cranky night
according to the codicil of the relationship agreement which you insisted upon we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night
you know i just put that in because of uterus stuff
well it applies to you too
i was afraid you might bring this up so i have a workaround there you go as far as you’re concerned i’m smiling although i must admit i’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant
so bernadette have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place
you know i’m thinking ripping up the carpets maybe lose the wallpaper all new light fixtures
you know if you knocked out this wall it would give you an open floor plan and then it’s a little scary but could be fun indoor fire pit
hey i grew up in this house okay no one’s knocking anything down
okay okay when he’s at comiccon i’m bringing in a wrecking ball
um this is a little weird but a lawyer was trying to contact my father because his name was still on the title for this house
well wait so if we have the same father are are you saying you’re my halfbrother
bernadette weird things are happening out here
i think i started to suspect it was a bad movie when i looked at the script and saw the title serial apeist 2
uh spoiler alert after the monkey sees it kills
i’ve just been handed a note i’m going to read it wil do you want more diet coke also we have juice
i i didn’t want to interrupt
uh that voice you just heard belongs to leonard penny’s fiancé uh leonard why don’t you grab some headphones and join us
so while leonard gets set up let’s take a call hello caller you are on with penny and wil from serial apeist 2
okay well i’ll apologize for the first time but the other nine are on you
thanks a lot caller you know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following
yeah i was at a sciencefiction convention and i saw a woman dressed as your halfape character
oh if she was with an indian guy dressed like a banana that was just my friends howard and raj
all right it’s time for a very special guest caller a friend of mine who you probably know as the director of such movies as clerks or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed clerks hello kevin smith
hey kevin it’s really exciting to talk to you
oh you guys are very sweet so penny listen i saw your movie
oh wow i wish it was better
oh don’t worry about it have you seen some of kevin’s films
you’re cruisin’ for a beatin’ wheaton anyway man i dug the ape movie penny and i thought you were like really great in it
you know i’m in the movie too
yeah whatever penny penny how come you’re not in more stuff man i’d cast you in a minute
oh yeah man i’m actually in preproduction on a movie right now way different than anything i’ve ever done before it’s called clerks 3 you should come over and read for a part
oh my i would love that
well maybe i can do both
i don’t think you can do both
i don’t think i asked you
stay out of it kevin smith
do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things
probably not it’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities
you know what i used to be a fan of evolution but i’ve since evolved and now i think it’s dumb
being left out is a terrible feeling no one understands that better than i do
hey look at that even in your example you’re all by yourself
when there was a lice epidemic at my school everybody got it except me i tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair but i just got attacked by bees
i can just picture them all right now at feynman’s house probably discussing schrodinger and at the same time not discussing schrodinger see they’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that
and at the same time not
it reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in i hated that so much
you know there’s nothing i can do about getting you invited to the symposium but if you wanted we could build a fort
i’ll get the blankets you google how to have childlike fun
you know what i’m being a bad host let me get some more coffee
oh let me do it howard
so josh what do you do
i’m studying oceanography down in san diego
oh how nice i loved finding nemo
enough chitchat how do we know you are who you say you are
okay you got me there you here looking for money
a kidney cornea piece of his liver
you’re in a beatles cover band and you need howard to replace your dad as ringo
why don’t you help with the coffee
okay but something smells fishy and not just because you work around sea animals that actually sounds interesting and i’d like to learn more about it hey you okay
not really this guy shows up out of the blue and now i have a brother my father has another family
i get it what do you want to do
i don’t know i i’d just like him to go away i can’t deal with this
all right i’ve got your back
thank you come on and i’d like to point out this wall just provided a lot of privacy
i can’t believe my brother’s an astronaut that’s amazing what was it like
listen dude it’s time for you to hit the road
hey hey the young man asked a good question
so for those of you just tuning in we are listening to a really fun fight between my costar…
no no no we’re not fighting we’re just having a conversation
all right we’re listening to a really fun conversation between my costar from serial apeist 2 and her fiancé who doesn’t believe women should have dreams
what is the harm if i audition
well what if you get it
i don’t know i make a movie become rich and famous win an oscar a golden globe and live an incredibly wonderful life
don’t you listen to him buddy you’re awesome you’re one of the greatest directors of our time
i don’t have a part for you wheaton
i’m just trying to protect you how many times did i see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress
okay instead of protecting me why don’t you try being excited when something good happens
i’m always excited for you i’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money
decent i make twice what you make
for those of you at home leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does let’s listen
i went to school for half my life i have a doctorate i’m still paying off college loans
well how much do you owe maybe i can help you out
wil can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit
for those of you at home i am shaking my head no
wonderful i just finished hanging the lights
yes oh but enter through the side batman is a loadbearing blanket
i know this isn’t the printout this is my real face
what are we doing this is a fort let’s sit on the floor
roughing it okay everything looks so big from down here this must be how leonard feels
i’m surprised you could hear me with this thin mint in your ear yeah pretty cool huh
yeah anyway i should probably get going
howie have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic
sorry i have a long drive
well i hope i get to see you again
i hope so too i’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with
hey i threw out the first pitch at an angels game
he did it with a robot
you had sex with a robot
hang on if you’re making all this money where is it
what does that mean under your bed
no it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds i’m not overly conservative i’m young so my guy said i can afford to take some risks
wait a minute you have a guy
why would i have a guy i don’t have any money
oh sweetie you should really get some money
for those of you listening at home how great is this
wil i’m begging you just please turn that off
leonard why are you making such a big deal out of this so our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years this is the way life is and i’m sure in time they’ll change again
great you’re not only more successful than me now you’re more mature
okay look would it make you feel better if i did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a kevin smith movie
that would be great thank you
i’m just gonna jump in here real quick leonard a moment ago you were dead set against penny resuming her acting career but now you’re all for it is it fair to say that she played you like a violin
so i have to ask was the robot sexy
it was actually just a mechanical hand
‘cause that’s all you need right
okay so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest or fort off are fort knox fort ticonderoga fort sumter and fort cozy mcblanket
i’d say knox over ticonderoga ’cause it’s got the gold
and mcblanket over sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count oh ten o’clock date night’s over
wait no we haven’t picked a winner
we both know this one’s gonna win
well of course we do fort knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library
come on i’ll help you take this down
well wait what if just this once we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later
well as long as we’re suspending the parameters i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover
very well i will agree to a familyfriendly grated boygirl sleepover
pg some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers
grated with a warning for families with babies and toddlers
do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas
would it alarm you to know that i hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up
it would but you know how much i admire preparedness how did you know we’d be in the living room
who says this is the only one i hid
okay well you kids have fun i’m gonna go to sleep
well leonard don’t you want to see the inside of the fort
oh come on i really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in
okay fine sheldon may i please visit your fort
i want to say no but it’s too glorious get in here
okay have a seat on the floor
hey would you like to hear some songs i’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences
yeah well i like music i like science i like making fun of sheldon hit it
there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his nameo james clerk space maxwell and james clerk maxwell was his nameo there was a scientist who had a theory and james clerk maxwell was his nameo ames…
uh okay okay uh we we get it
perhaps you’d prefer this one the itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all because it haseight legs and two body parts
thank you do either of you know beyoncé i’d love her to get behind it
you guys know the new discovery class missions that nasa’s been working on
well they’re looking to include a message from earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life
oh when i encountered alien life i discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot
all right you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler he’s allergic to earth nuts but i’m the alien
anyway i’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system
and i was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it
are you kidding yes what did you have in mind
i’ll tell you exactly what you should do avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm
yeah absolutely you need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities
any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space so the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic
ooh how about a 3d tactile communicator rigged for crosssensory transposition
exactly what i expected two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were you two are out congratulations leonard you’re on the team
i would have included the others but you know exactly what would’ve happened they would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around
i get it uh just this morning sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my grapenuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict
you should have told him to mind his own business
yeah that’s better than what i did say which was fine i’ll eat them with club soda
what makes them think they’re always in charge of everything
huh what does that make us
we could be betas they’re second in charge
or we could be omegas they get pushed around by the alphas and the betas
whatever there’s no alphas here and this is your project you’re in charge how do you want to start
i don’t know how do you want to start
i don’t know should we call sheldon and howard
no we can do this by ourselves
okay great how do you want to start
i don’t know how do you want to start
knock knock knock sheldon knock knock knock sheldon knock knock knock sheldon
i bet that started off as a joke but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it
yeah i kind of want to do it again
i don’t recommend it you’ll be doing it the rest of your life anyway if you’re looking for leonard he’s with koothrappali
uh no i actually came to talk to you
how nice here are some topics that interest me quantum mechanics trains flags
no no it’s about my acting career
oh sorry that’s not on the list
oh wait no how about we split the difference and discuss why austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy
okay look here’s the thing i like pharmaceutical sales it’s going great but i have an audition for a movie and if i get it it could screw everything up
hmm i know exactly what you should do unfortunately i cannot tell you
i’m attempting to turn over a new leaf earlier today it was pointed out to me that i tend to force my ideas on people
you’re really not gonna tell me
no that train has left the station now we can play this one of two ways you can say trains tell me more or you can just look at me like that and i’ll start
i am making molecular cocktails this sphere is actually a cosmopolitan
oh how do you drink it
oh just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit
i think i’ll have a beer
first take a picture with me
well raj and i always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together so i taught myself and i’m putting this on instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd say cheese
is this about the space probe he’s working on without you
howard you’re grown men you guys don’t have to do everything together
i know that’s why i’m spending tonight with you
no he is so i have a dominant personality we all know that
i’m sorry what do we know
in social groupings i just naturally wind up in charge
don’t take this the wrong way but how many of these little booze balls have you had
you don’t think i’m a leader
i was kidding of course you are
right i couldn’t change if i wanted to
you better not change because i love who you are now will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself
so often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks now while commonly known as a cowcatcher i prefer the more accurate cow exploder
okay sheldon let me ask you a question
if i was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie which train should i get on
are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice
all right then you should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information
oh you’re right i’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet huh you are a wise man
well penny who’s smarter the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice
oh i guess you’re right maybe it is the person who asks
no it’s the wise man that’s why he’s called the wise man you know how i know that i’m the wise man
i’m sorry what was i thinking
uh just out of curiosity why didn’t you ask leonard for advice about this
‘cause i already know what he’ll say wah wah wah you shouldn’t do it
ah it’s just like he’s here
okay so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space like the golden record on voyager were heavily criticized
well aliens could only play the golden record if they figured out how to build a record player
eh although to be fair i watched et build a telephone out of a speak  spell and an umbrella dude was like a little brown macgyver
that would be more helpful if et were real
well my feelings were real when he was about to die
my god when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him
they zip him up in that bag
okay let’s talk about something else
all right so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple
and doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it
it’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see i mean they might communicate in a totally different way than us
like when my dog is mad at me she tells me by peeing in my slippers
that’s actually a valid example animals do deliver messages through scent
bees talk to each other by dancing whales have their songs
yeah penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different
okay so what it sounds like is what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight but other senses as well
the most basic sense that any spacefaring civilization would have to possess is touch
ooh ooh ooh we could make a videoplaying device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium
all we have to do is rig up a 3d communication system
we we can totally do that
yeah you know what else it is
exactly what sheldon and howard said
well thank you for peeing in my slippers
it’s the eye of the tiger it’s the ear of the bat it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus
hang on not that your song isn’t terrible it is but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar
you didn’t let me finish and also regarding the bat it has sonar
look i know you guys are upset but we’ve talked about it and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project
well well well did you hear that sheldon
i’m sorry i was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark
we want you back on the project with us
well well well did you hear that howard
look we admit it the idea that you guys came up with was really good and i’d love your help
i suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that
it wasn’t so are you in
great now that we’re all on the same page let’s get together tonight and work on it
get together tonight leonard stop trying to control everything and give poor raj a chance to come up with what we should do go ahead raj
okay i think we should do it right now
okay it’s just an audition why am i nervous maybe it’s a good thing just means i want it and i can have it this feels right why did i ever give this up out loud i’m starting to remember
so i’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled when you talk instead of bringing up a new idea respect what was just said by building on it
uh building on that we should order dinner
how is that building on what he just said
building on what sheldon said i could go for chinese
hang on building on what leonard said no one built on what i said
building on building on that there’s a new buildyourown pizza place on colorado
building on that i’d like to remind you i’m lactose intolerant
i saw the menu they have soy cheese
bah you didn’t say building on you’re out
yeah you’re missing the point sheldon
you’re out and you’re out i win who wants pizza
hey i haven’t seen you auditioning in a while
yeah uh i got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep
well kind of but now i get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect
yeah it’s going okay but i do miss this sometimes
‘cause i got to tell you i am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat
okay since we agree on the delivery system for the message maybe we should talk about what the message could be
well i think we should show what earthlings look like
the plaque they sent up on the pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it
yeah i never cared for that it’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are
oh don’t be offended you know of the four of us you have the most veallike consistency
well maybe there’s a way to appear nonaggressive but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary like smiling and waving with one hand but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger
you want to send a passiveaggressive message out into the universe that’s ridiculous
oh you mean passiveaggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth
perhaps howard meant passiveaggressive like asking our group to help on your project and then only choosing leonard
look i’m sorry i hurt your feelings but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over
what about when we went to comiccon and dressed like jabba the hutt you got to be jabba’s head and i got to be his fat slug butt
you let a guy sit on me
he was dressed as princess leia it made a nice picture
i’m just saying sometimes raj and i feel pushed aside
yeah like when you took sheldon to texas and showed him all around nasa you didn’t even think to ask me and leonard
you know what you’re right i should have asked you
yeah and if he does ask you go it’s amazing
okay and if we’re talking about being left out of things you guys went to skywalker ranch without us
oh i recommend that too that was a magical experience
wait a minute sheldon spent a whole day with james earl jones and never told any of us
i sure did oh my goodness well from jabba’s head to ice cream with darth vader i’m having a heck of a ride yeah look clearly good things happen when i’m in charge now why don’t you boys step aside let me knock this project out
sheldon you’re not in charge raj is in charge
leonard who’s really in charge the person in charge or those who put him in charge
he’s right if you think about it we’re all in charge
no the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these
i mean the whole experience reminded me about how much i hated about that world you you know the anxiety the depression the negativity i don’t want to feel those things i want to sell drugs to people who feel those things
i can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie
i did i mean i walked in read for the part then stunk up the place but then i walked right out
well i’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job
i do and you know i don’t think i’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it
properly at all it’s just words i’ve never heard
well thank you you’re a good friend and you changed my life
you’re welcome hey now that you’re making some real money maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thankyou dinner
and you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it and it would be awkward to exclude her
greetings from planet earth just turn left at alpha centauri you can’t miss it
it’s like the best one they make i just can’t get it to work
it streams hd video straight to your phone while it’s flying
nice where were you when i was single
okay we should leave in about an hour you all packed
uh yeah i just need to throw in a few last minute things you know makeup underwear clothes
if your bathroom floor counts as a carryon you’re packed
leonard have you ever given a high school commencement speech before
aren’t you afraid of being blinded
at the end of the ceremony all the students throw those pointy hats in the air it’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye
fine i wonder if they make i told you so cards in braille
look the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring ooh do you own a tshirt cannon
why would he own a tshirt cannon
i don’t know why do i own one
i think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with penny
mm i thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds i even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me
well now you get to go back as a successful scientist
with a beautiful girl on your arm
and a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball
how’d you get ready so fast
oh i pack light once i got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long tshirt and a belt
why did you need a belt
it’s called an evening look i’ve never been to new jersey before
it gets a bad rap from shows like jersey shore and real housewives
so it’s not really like that
no it’s like that well i’m excited to show you around
you think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there
yes we’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press but i’m not doing that either receives text uhoh i just got an alert our flight’s been cancelled
yeah looks like there’s a big storm all up the east coast
well can we get on another airline
so that’s it we’re not going
yeah i worked hard on that speech too
oh you could tell it to me
oh thank you but i’m okay
are you sure i could pretend i’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni
okay the wifi extender is on the camera’s on they’re both on the same network we should be getting an image
all i see is a black screen and my own reflection i look sad
step one rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times
why would they say at least is it ten toggles is it a hundred toggles you know is it a thousand toggles ten thousand toggles a hundred thousand toggles
you see where i’m going with this
just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow
all right that seems simple enough initiating calibration sequence one two three four five six seven eight nine ten well i suppose ten is technically at least ten but they’re still getting at least one angry letter
now i rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green
initiating rotation sequence don’t look at me initiate what does red and yellow mean
it means the calibration failed we have to start over
oh very well reinitiating calibration sequence one two three four five six seven eight nine ten… eleven it’s a good thing i didn’t send that letter
not much just wanted to see how my son’s doing
are you still dating that dermatologist
if you could feel how soft my skin is you wouldn’t have to ask
oh and there’s something else i wanted to ask you why did you spend a month’s rent on a toy helicopter
oh you’re where that bill goes
i’m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle it’s time you learned responsibility and the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance
no daddy no there are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility i know you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week
no my mind is made up starting now you’re on your own
but daddy i i miss my family so much and with you and mummy getting a divorce i feel sad and empty buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void so while i can’t hug you every day flying that helicopter…
just to be clear financially or midsentence
no red and yellow no red and yellow
we did it oh if it’s this much fun to rotate imagine when we fly it
okay now all i have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off
oh all right playtime’s over let’s open this baby up
sheldon i have a master’s degree in engineering i wipe my bottom with warranties except for applecare that pays for itself in the long run
i got you a little something to cheer you up
really sex last night pancakes this morning am i dying
a cap and gown why do i need a cap and gown
because you are giving your commencement speech
i called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over skype
really that’s amazing and you gave me the robes to give it in thank you
yeah now about those uh they came from a costume shop and all they had left was sexy graduate so they might be a little short
short and sexy that’s my wheelhouse
boy oh boy that’s a lot of pieces
you know what they all do right
well i how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits
that right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit
so can you get it working
i’m an mittrained engineer i’ve built components for the space station
i thought the zerogravity toilet didn’t work
it worked fine it just wasn’t designed for russian cosmonauts and their potatobased diet
i have to return the helicopter my father… what did you do
well don’t worry he went to mit he can solve any problem as long as it doesn’t originate in a russian man’s colon
no you have to put this back together right now so i can return it
you can’t return it howard wiped his bottom with the warranty
i think metaphorically but he was in the bathroom for a while
howard my father cut me off i have to get my money back for this
okay okay you’re right it’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life be a man on phone hello mummy
hello rajesh what a nice surprise
well i’ve been thinking about you how are you doing are you happy mummy
such a sweet boy for asking can’t believe you come from the poison seed of your father
well i like to think i take mostly after you anyway speaking of daddy i had a very strange conversation with him he said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life
what does that mean active social life
well let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to let’s talk about you
rajesh is your father seeing someone
all i know mummy is that he’s a single wealthy doctor and now for some reason there’s no money for your little boy
well however much money your father was giving you i’ll give you more
thank you mummy i love you helicopters for everybody
i don’t think this is gonna work
just let me see sweetie you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown
a surprised you know that b i wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you
yeah you’re gonna be on skype they’re not gonna see your legs
well i’m gonna go put on some pants just in case but i have to say this is very freeing
add a belt and i’ll take you some place nice
okay i think i’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip
very impressive you know when you’re done with that can you look at this it doesn’t make smoke anymore
mm sorry ah maybe it’s for the best i hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados
i have the tool you wanted
you guys don’t have to go to the trouble i’m back in the money now i can just buy another helicopter
it’s not about the money it’s about solving a problem it’s why i became an engineer it’s what i like to do it’s what i’m trained to do it’s who i am
oh look at you the little engineer that could
why don’t you just call tech support
there’s two kinds of people in this world those who call tech support and those who make fun of the people who call tech support
i call tech support all the time
members of the faculty students i’m excited to speak to you today i can’t help but remember the last time i was in this auditorium two guys from the lacrosse team played keepaway with my asthma inhaler but enough about my tenyear reunion i’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible even though weather nearly prevented it
oh hello i i didn’t know he was gonna point it at me so don’t do drugs and stay in school
all right the power supply is reconnected i think we’re back in business let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside sheldon we got wifi
four hours of our lives gone check
all right all systems go in five…
that’s what my train used to do
give me the number probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual i have raj’s phone rings
it’s my father you jerks hello daddy
what did you say to your mother
nothing i was just calling to check in make sure she’s doing okay
well after talking to you she seems to think i’m some sort of playboy
really i don’t know where she’d get an idea like that you know mummy and her crazy imagination i’m so lucky i take after you
you think you take after me
well i try to i certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model reentering apartment who wants to go to vegas in a real helicopter
it was l frank baum who said no thief however skillful can rob one of knowledge and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure wow i’m boring myself sorry i can’t see any of your faces right now but i bet they look like this uh you know i i wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is but i hated it maybe high school’s great if you look like this but i didn’t even feel like i existed at that school and now that i think about it i bet a lot of you feel the same way so for the remainder of my speech this is for the invisible kids uh maybe you never fit in or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school or the heaviest or the weirdest maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss by the way 19 and geraldine coco wherever you are thank you maybe you don’t have any friends and guess what that’s okay while all the popular kids are off doing whatever i don’t know what they were doing ’cause i was never there
my point is while you’re spending all this time on your own building computers or practicing your cello what you’re really doing is becoming interesting and when people finally do notice you they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought and for those of you who were popular in high school it’s over sorry thank you and congratulations
what happened to me when did i become an old man baffled by modern technology next thing you know i’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to
it is awful isn’t it listen to that noise
hang on hang on it’s working i did it
no idea but i did it
maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside
i don’t know must be getting a wifi signal from somewhere else
initiate landing sequence initiate landing sequence hey the camera’s working oh look it’s me
yes it’s a robot uprising call the police
so you really think they liked it
oh sweetie it was the best speech i…
don’t worry everyone in here is safe
leonard what time does your mom’s plane get in
i don’t know some time tomorrow morning
don’t you want to know for sure
no need to as soon as she flies into california airspace i’ll feel a disturbance in the force
it’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award
well my mother’s been there for every honour i’ve won since i beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy how does this look
aw it’s so nice she’s gonna love it
sure his mom gets roses when i want them they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals
you act like i didn’t get you that mushroom log on valentine’s day
he’s right roses die but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years
you know your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship maybe i should get her something so she warms up to me
if you could run out and get a phd that might make her like you
really it didn’t work for you
do you think the moms will get along
uh i don’t know they’re pretty different
maybe they’ll be best friends one of them is brilliant one is sweet and simple sound familiar
shelly i’m so proud of you and leonard for getting this award
i tried to read your paper but it was very hard for me to understand
oh it’s quite straightforward actually it describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an ndimensional superfluid
interesting you can believe that but god filling an ark with animals twobytwo is nonsense
what did they feed the lions mother
the floating bodies of drowned sinners of course
listen leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science can you please keep the bible babble to yourself while she’s here
of course not i love you i’m just embarrassed by the things you believe do and say
well i love you too my little bowl of lion chow
so have you and penny set a wedding date
no we’re kind of taking it slow
you’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year one has to wonder if there’s a problem are you having satisfactory intercourse
i change my answer it it’s amazing it’s hot we can barely keep our hands off each other
seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess but then you always did have that unresolved oedipal complex
see this right here what you’re doing can you please not do that around sheldon’s mom
why are you attracted to her too
of course not she’s she’s just a very sweet and godfearing lady and you have to be respectful of her beliefs
leonard i’m an adult i know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life
oh doctor hofstadter it’s so good to see you again
likewise i read your paper it was very impressive
we just spent two hours in traffic did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper
of course i did but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s selfesteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval
that’s so sweet you think i have selfesteem
doctor hofstadter i want you to meet my mother mary
nice to meet you too how was your flight
lovely almost as if someone not saying who was watching over the plane
we talked about this i don’t mind you still living here but we got to have some rules and rule number one is pants
you must be very proud of your son
oh yes he recently argued a case before the supreme court
oh you mean this son uh sure he’s terrific
beverly would you like to see the math i worked out to support our hypothesis
you mean my hypothesis i hypothesized it all by myself
calm down dear mary i’m curious when did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind
ooh good question everyone loves stories about sheldon cooper boy genius
well i would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed
ooh this is a good one
now the first thing you have to know about shelly is ever since he was a little boy he was always concerned with the wellbeing of others and he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity so he was gonna power the entire town for free
tell her about the uranium tell her about the uranium
oh well oh this is adorable when he arranged to get some yellowcake from chad i thought he was talking about twinkies from one of his friends
but i wasn’t ‘cause i didn’t have any friends
no it turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my visa card to buy uranium from an african warlord in the country of chad
sounds like sheldon was a handful
you still are uh mom hey tell mary the story about how i made a van der graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner
all right he broke the vacuum cleaner
i mean for a while everything was vampires now it’s all zombies i wonder what the next monster fad will be
we haven’t had a good invisible man in a while
clearly you’ve never seen me try to talk to a woman
guys in the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games i got the car washed picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank
okay i don’t know when i became the mother to three lazy teenagers but it stops today you guys are cleaning the kitchen top to bottom
hey i don’t even live here
yes or no do you have clothes in my laundry right now
i do and some of it’s wool so dry flat if possible
oh and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree
well i had just begun puberty it was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life
oh true but all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen
hey sorry got caught up at work hi beverly
good to see you again dear
ah yeah now that’s what i’m talking about
so mom you haven’t seen penny since we got engaged
oh yeah let me show you the ring
oh lovely must have been very expensive
oh no not at all no we uh found a place online that uh repurposes diamond drill bits
we did not that’s not true can i speak to you alone for a second
really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring i think
did i misspeak about the ring
yes and we’ll get back to that but uh even with your mother here you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom you’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers
do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning
yes you are a super weaner
well now i have to correct you as a bit of an elephant seal buff the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup so i believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler
yeah you’re right that is the term i’m looking for you are a dirty double mother suckler
okay well now that we have the terminology straightened out how dare you
we’re not in a rush we’ll set a date when the time is right
it doesn’t matter sweetie the moment a man lays with a woman they are married in the eyes of the lord
uch the bible is uch to you
no i’m sorry that was inappropriate as a psychiatrist i know how important people’s superstitions can be to them
you want to talk about superstitions sheldon sent me the books you wrote all that nonsense about superegos and ids what bull dropped that on the barn floor
hey look at that you both believe in jewish bearded guys
at least the bearded man that i believe in preaches love and compassion all yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama
it’s fascinating how can someone as enlightened as sheldon come from someone like you
i know the answer you’re not gonna like it
when i was pregnant with shelly i was driving to church and i was praying to the lord to give me a son smarter than his dumbass daddy and i looked over and i saw a jesus bobblehead in the subaru next to me nodding yes what is that supposed to mean
well do it some more maybe you can knock some sense into yourself
why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe you know like shoes or how cute little chinese babies are
it is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you
oh don’t flatter yourself she likes everybody better than she likes me
well it’s carrots so gonna say very
sorry we have to do this
bernadette’s not wrong she does work hard around here
yeah maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much
i saw her pull you home in a wagon
for your information i twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck
face it dude bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to and that was not a healthy relationship
you’re right it’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash bernie i made a mess
i’m terribly sorry that i upset your mother
oh it’s all right she’ll forgive you she has to or she goes to hell
i can’t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies
well you doled out affection as a reward for achievement a proven way to raise a child or train a rat
but look how well you turned out
i’d feign modesty at this point but who would believe me still you need to consider how successful leonard’s brother and sister are
while my brother and sister are mouthbreathing idiots
do you suppose you would’ve flourished more in a rewardbased environment
perhaps but my mom made me spaghetti with choppedup hot dogs whenever i wanted so who cares
not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself i always had to earn it
oh leonard i’m sure she loves you very much in her own cold godless way
yeah and you certainly don’t have to earn my love
of course you already knew that when you bought me this princesscut drill bit
when your mom gets back i’m gonna need to apologize for the way i spoke to her
well come on now she did kind of start it
doesn’t matter a good christian would’ve turned the other cheek on the other hand a good texan would’ve shot her so i just kind of split the difference hey who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs
i don’t really feel i deserve it
that was a big sticky mess but i think i got it
look at that you cleaned it up all by yourself
yes i cleaned it up all by myself honestly i don’t know why you complain so… okay maybe i missed one spot just leave
i’m so glad that you and i were able to bury the hatchet
me too and i respect your right to your beliefs
and i will pray for you
okay mom let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else
one moment there’s something i need to say to you
leonard i always made you earn my affection but today i realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child
therefore i would like to initiate a new protocol wherein i shower you with unconditional love
it’s the hardknock life for us it’s the hardknock life for us ‘stead of treated we get tricked ‘stead of kisses we get kicked it’s the hardknock life got no folks to speak of so it’s the hardknock row we hoe cotton blankets ‘stead of wool empty bellies ‘stead of full it’s a hardknock life
can you believe it’s been five years since our first date
i know do you think i should start watching the flash tv show
yes i thought i can’t decide if i should watch the flash tv show i know i’ll ask amy anyway
you’re right you did kind of kill the mood
i didn’t kill anything you did talking about your stupid tv show
excuse me starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly i’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here
really that’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with sheldon do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed while after five years all i can get out of you is a distracted makeout session on a couch
irony’s not really my strong suit but i have been getting better with sarcasm if you want to give that a try
i don’t want to rush you but i’m closing a little early tonight
uh no i overheard bernadette tell howard she was making him a meat loaf and you don’t have to not ask me twice
if i stick a light bulb on this wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom
oh is this freaking you out
i guess i’m just more of a pottery barn crate and barrel kind of guy maybe pier 1 if i really want to cut loose
no no no hey you should totally get it in fact i’ll buy it for you
raj you don’t have to do that
well now we know next time we go to the farmers’ market the order is petting zoo first then buy vegetables
oh good you’re here i need your assistance
can it wait until i put a bandaid on a goat bite
oh your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals
mmm so what do you need help with
amy’s mad at me and i’m not clear why
okay were you talking before she got upset
that’s probably it what’d you say to her
well i just asked her if i should start watching the new flash tv series
baffling right we were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers i stopped so i could ask the question next thing i know goodbye kissy face hello yelly face
well sheldon when you’re kissing a girl she expects the attention to be on her
it was i asked her if she thought i should watch the flash
i’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show
oh no not just a season if i’m in i’m in for the whole run even if the quality declines
i get it smallville almost wrecked you
yeah exactly you know i waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly fly
wait what is wrong with you two he was talking about television during their date night
oh not just date night our fifth anniversary
okay see that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat
if that happens don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can
you guys ever notice that emily has a bit of a twisted side
you mean ’cause she has weird tattoos
no because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard
she and i were supposed to watch the new avengers movie tonight but it was sold out so i said what else do you want to do she said let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave
like a random person or somebody she knew
well if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along then you know she holds a grudge
the only issue is that everybody has their own thing and as long as it’s two consenting adults i guess i don’t see the harm in it
well what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone
well then i guess bring a blanket the grass gets damp at night
i don’t know guys maybe this relationship isn’t for me maybe i should break up with her
right you’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you can you believe this guy
i think if raj wants to break up with a girl he can do it
how are you saying that with a straight face
buddy other than jenny craig you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life
you’re one to talk you’ve been complaining about stuart living here for the past year i don’t see you showing him the door
that’s not the same thing emily’s a person stuart’s more like an infestation something you spray for
baloney okay you two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as i am
that’s not true we were just laughing right in your face
yeah i wish i’d fought harder for the rest of ’em
no and i’m confused it’s been nearly 24 hours amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now
hey i don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship
yeah you’ve been going out for years you haven’t even slept together
that’s right it’s called foreplay and i could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship
but you’ve been engaged for over a year now and you don’t even have a wedding date
well we will we’re just not in a rush
yeah it’s just things are good right now
and we’ve been busy with our paper
yeah we’ll pick a date when we pick a date
you know i can see why amy’s mad at you
did you eat all my yoghurt
you mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do
you know which yoghurt i mean
i didn’t touch it must have been stuart
maybe raj is right maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out
we should have done it months ago
i know but his store was reopening and then there were the holidays and then he was sick
yeah right sick he didn’t have jaundice he just looks like that
agreed when he gets home i’m dropping the hammer
ooh i like when you take charge
oh i’m not taking charge you’re the hammer
so why haven’t we picked a date
well of course i know why but just for fun why
not in a rush busy with work…
you still want to get married right
oh my god yes why would you even ask that
i don’t know because we don’t have a date
well you want a date pick a date
it’s not just the date we haven’t talked about anything big wedding small wedding indoor outdoor
outdoor oh i can rsvp no right now
okay indoor it is big or small
is your dad paying for it
all right well i want it in a church
fine i want to release butterflies
okay well then it’s settled small indoor church wedding blacktie no butterflies
you still didn’t pick a date
oh yes we’ve got the moon and the trees and elizabeth mcnulty who apparently died when she was the same age i am
makes you feel alive doesn’t it
so does enjoying a meal at a welllit restaurant but here we are
of ghosts no of you little bit
i’m sorry i’ve upset you i shouldn’t have asked so many questions
yeah maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff
well look at that even when i’m causing problems i make the world a better place hey next why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and penny’s love of the ol’ glugglug
uh sheldon i think we’re good for now
ah well very well so does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date
here we go again why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date we’re committed to each other we’re happy a ceremony isn’t gonna change anything
so you’re never getting married it’s his whining isn’t it
it’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it
look all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now
ew 50 we’ll be old and gross
yeah but we’ll be old and gross together
my aunt and uncle were married 63 years towards the end it was like watching cheese melt
are you saying you want to get married
after all these years i’m really happy for the two of you
now get out of my spot
bernie stuart just pulled up so remember the key is to be firm show no weakness
howard joel wolowitz you get back here
never should have told you my middle name
sure uh let me just put this stuff in the fridge i felt bad for finishing your yoghurt so i bought more and howard your favourite fruit is in season crunch berries
it’s hard not to they taste so much better than real berries
well you’ve been living here a while now
i know i may sell comic books at work but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me
his middle name is david go
look i care about you a lot but we are very different people
are you breaking up with me
no no i’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and i’m dark on the outside
so anyway what i’m trying to say is… phone rings
it’s just my dad probably calling to wish me a happy birthday i’ll call him back you were saying
look raj be honest with me if you want to end things just do it don’t expect me to do it for you
end things i’m trying to tell you that i love you
wow there’s a denny’s in vegas you can actually get married in
yeah but we could get heartshaped pancakes
i’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel
i know you think people are gonna be mad
maybe but this isn’t about them it’s about us
it is it is about us
and you know what the best part is we took our time i mean we met we were friends for a couple years then we got together and then we got untogether then we worked out all our problems and now we know everything about each other we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets
uh well there there’s one thing i feel i should tell you
you know so we can go into this with no secrets between us
remember uh a couple years back when i was on that research ship in the north sea
okay well there there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on
okay um well there was this girl
nothing really it was just kissing
and then nothing i stopped it but it still bothers me and i wanted you to know
did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been
you know can i ask you a question
why are you telling me this now
well like i said we’re about to get married and i i want a clean slate no secrets
really because to me it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it
would you rather i didn’t tell you
no i don’t want there to be secrets between us
see now i’m confused i mean what what am i supposed to do
uh keep your mouth off other women
i can do that uh uh from now on this mouth you and food that’s it
look i’m not happy this happened but i think i can get past it i mean we weren’t engaged at the time and it was just kissing
it wasn’t even very good she was a smoker i’d just been seasick
and it’s the happiest day of our lives
hello listen i’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be and i think…
i’ve been thinking about them too sheldon being your girlfriend is so challenging emotionally physically i’ve been incredibly patient for years
okay well this isn’t easy to say because i love you but i need some time to take a step back and reevaluate our situation
well gollum you’re an expert on rings what do i do with this one
so what package are you thinking
mm this one comes with music and flowers oh they even stream the whole thing live on the internet
‘cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short nearsighted scientist let’s give them hope
whatever put us on the internet i’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section
if you’re not into this we can do it another time
no no i want to look we’ve put this off long enough let’s do it
aw that’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together phone oh excuse me sheldon hey
leonard have you gotten married yet
some important new information has come to light women are the worst i thought it was paper cuts but i was wrong no piece of paper ever cut me this deep
no of course not they thrive on our suffering
buddy i’m so sorry is there anything i can do
yes if i ever talk about going out with a girl again roll your eyes at me like i do to you when you say dumb things
sheldon uh okay just because you’re going through this with amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad
hey i just heard about you and sheldon are you okay
not really can you come over
uh actually i’m in vegas leonard and i are about to get married
hold on you’re getting married and you didn’t invite me
well it was kind of a spurofthemoment thing
wow hope i can catch the bouquet from here
why did i just hear amy’s name
penny’s on the phone with her
did she say anything about me never mind i don’t care well if you care you can find out and tell me just don’t be shocked when you find out that i don’t care
okay will you relax you’re not missing anything special
she’s upset look it’s gonna be a great wedding look at you in your little suit
amy’s upset is it about me
no i think it’s because we’re eloping
your marriage is causing her pain yeah great i take it back go ahead and do it yay for love
oh what are you doing here
when last we spoke you said you needed time
well it’s only been 11 hours
the lord of the rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours i made you watch that you said it was an eternity
sheldon when i’m ready to talk i’ll let you know
very well you seem to be headed somewhere may i walk with you
boy i’m glad we’re going out again
why is there someone else just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost could you
if you must know i’m going to howard and bernadette’s to watch the wedding
and who’s this guy you’re taking
oh you’re going to a wedding alone that’s sad
i’m not gonna be alone i’ll be with my friends
your friends well i think you mean my friends and why wasn’t i invited to this
maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward
we make everyone feel awkward that’s our thing
they’re running a little behind should be pretty soon
hey if you’re hungry there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door
thanks but i don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs
i don’t think the strippers prepare the meal but okay look it’s not how i pictured it either but i’m still glad we’re doing it
and you promise you’re okay with everything from the car
oh my god would you stop bringing it up
you’re right i’m sorry we have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it so what do you think should we run next door and grab a bite
what if they call our names
oh don’t worry they gave me this vibrating coaster
oh and the fairy tale continues
we were together for so long i honestly don’t know what i’m feeling
well that’s understandable you forgot it’s called happy
i’m not saying anything bad just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon
i know what you’re going through my my my last breakup was pretty tough
hey it’s a true story i don’t need the third degree
for god’s sake sheldon what are you doing
i didn’t want to come in i was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable so i’ll just stay out here and pretend that i don’t have to go to the bathroom
sheldon you being here might not be making things better
i see and is that why everybody was invited but me
they didn’t invite everybody but youbernadette invited me and stuart lives here
so when you hear the music that’s your cue any questions
oh the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals
we can use the potpourri from the bathroom
yup just want to get married
great i’ll see you two up there
was that a yes or no on the potpourri
raj you’re probably wondering why amy and i aren’t showing any affection to one another
didn’t even crack the top ten
well you should know that she recently broke up with me
i said i needed time to think
i’m sure you guys will figure something out
you hear that raj is devastated
i see what’s happening sides are forming well if bernadette’s on amy’s team i pick howard
fine i guess i’m stuck with raj
before i go any further have either of you prepared your own vows
well i don’t have any you’re kind of making me look bad
it’s okay i don’t have to say them
no no no go ahead i’ll come up with something mushy you’ll cry we got this
penny we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began i like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us so that we could be together and make each other whole
right um okay leonard i mean you’re not only the love of my life i mean you’re my best friend and you’ve got a friend in me you got troubles i got ’em too there isn’t anything i wouldn’t do for you we stick together and we can see it through ’cause you’ve got a friend in me
is that the song from toy story
yeah i mean not like our wedding beautiful
amy i don’t understand are we broken up or not it’s like you can’t make up your mind
it’s because you’re not giving me any space to think
well you should think fast because men can sire offspring their entire lives but those eggs you’re toting around have a sellby date
you know what sheldon you’ve made this really easy you’re immature you’re selfish you just insulted me to my face i don’t need any more time to think we’re broken up
yeah come on i’ll give you a ride
yeah i’m so glad you guys could watch
we’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section
no no no hang on i believe i’m supposed to carry you across the threshold
who do you think carries sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the tv
okay let’s do it you gonna make it
thank you finally there’s a mrs hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me
well the night is still young
it’s just when we were kissing i couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl
oh no no come on i have a friend in you you said so
yeah okay listen if you’re imagining that it was sexy it wasn’t we we were both drunk and she smelled like an ashtray the boat was moving a lot so i chipped her tooth
did you feel guilty after kissing her
yes i felt guilty as soon as it happened i feel guilty every time i see her
what do you mean every time you see her
what do i mean boy that’s a toughie
well no not socially but you know just at work
you work with her how could you not tell me that
i wanted to tell you in the car but you told me to stop talking
oh okay so you’re saying this is my fault
no of course not okay look instead of fighting why don’t we dim the lights um get naked and make a baby i was trying to lighten the mood it’s not easy you try it
i just wanted to let you know that you can remove amy from your nightly prayers unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head
no i’ll be okay but i think that i’d like to send the ring back to you
well let’s not be hasty are you sure it’s over for good
it’s over for me i’m done with women like when i swore off pop rocks they both hurt you on purpose
you want to tell me what happened
are you going to say it’s all part of god’s plan
well honey don’t send it back yet your sister’s married and i’m not letting your brother give my grandmother’s ring to that whore he’s dating
wasn’t mary magdalene a woman of ill repute
when your idiot brother redeems mankind he can date whoever he wants
i know it hurts now but it’s gonna get better
you’ve got so much to offer
any man would be lucky to have you
i just hope i did the right thing
i’m sure you did maybe that’s the problem you always do the right thing maybe it’s time to do the wrong thing
i asked you over and over if you were okay why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t
i thought i was okay but it turns out i’m not
okay listen i may not have been entirely faithful but you you are not easy to lift
wow well marriage must agree with you well you are just glowing
well whatever it is it agrees with you
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
leonard told me what happened so i took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage
oh that’s so sweet of you
yeah i know turns out being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days i blame madonna
i’m sorry to hear about you and amy
well i’m sorry about leonard thought i raised him better than that
you know it’s bad enough what happened but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university
oh you don’t need to worry about her she’s brilliant and attractive she can do way better
wait a minute i know this may sound far fetched but i’m on the market now you know if i dated mandy that would teach both leonard and amy a lesson
oh you’re right i could never be with a woman whose selfesteem was so low she’d be with leonard
yeah i know forever who would have believed these things would happen to us
right i can’t believe amy actually went through with it
hang on you knew that she was going to end it with me did you try and stop her
i told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy
do what makes her happy she plays the harp and her car is paid for how much happier can she be
okay look it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend
i see well i think i’ll be going
no no no no we are done here would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me
thank you and slam it hard because i am pretty steamed
all right leonard hang in there talk to you tomorrow
what happened they just got married
i don’t know it’s a mess they had a huge fight in vegas
i don’t know sounds pretty bad penny’s back in her apartment all by herself
would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women
sure let’s make it an even hundred
you would never kiss me and make me say i love you and then break up with me
and you know why ‘cause you’re a man the champagne of genders
well i may be a man but i think i’m the one that screwed up on this one
yeah well and you admit it like a man all you hear women say is i’ll just have a salad you know where’s my lip gloss i think this element should be called radium that last one was madame curie
you know what she was kind of an honorary man she had a penis made of science
can’t believe i’m spending my wedding night with you
really i never imagined it any other way
how am i supposed to sleep i’ve been married less than 24 hours and my wife isn’t speaking to me
perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light in one day you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve
me neither but i just had a tickle in my throat not profound marital problems
please tell me how i can fix it
glad you asked as i see it there’s a simple solution your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman it seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship you should find another man and dally with him and by dally i mean some hardcore mouthonmouth action
okay that is the stupidest thing i’ve ever heard
actually i think he’s onto something
you can’t be serious ‘cause i messed up and made out with a girl you’re gonna do the same with a random guy
i will tell you what is happening i am saving my best friend’s marriage
sheldon i don’t think you understand how being broken up works the only way i can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us every time i see you it retraumatizes me i go through the pain all over again
i understand we’re no longer a couple but i would like to remind you that we made a baby together
a precocious little internet show known as fun with flags
great see you in about half an hour
sheldon i am not doing fun with flags with you
sonny and cher made it work their variety show kept going long after the divorce and here we are still talking about them
no one’s talking about sonny and cher
you must be thinking about donny and marie ’cause you and i are clearly talking about sonny and cher
sheldon this has to stop i know it’s hard it’s hard for me too but i’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together
well if you want to see less of me maybe we should go out again
i can’t believe you made out with mandy chao
well trust me i wish it never happened
and you knew about this this whole time
and you didn’t think to tell me
leonard asked me to keep it to myself
let’s leave leonard out of this for the moment this is about you and me
wait wait wait how is my dayold marriage falling apart becoming about you two
hang on what do i need to do to make you trust me
you think it’s hard having one wife try having two
i bet you told bernadette all about how he was screwing around with mandy chao
oh we didn’t screw around we just got drunk and made out
whatever it would have been nice to hear it from you
i’m here to return your belongings that’s what people who’ve broken up do
and you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so i would open the door
on the contrary you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities we’re not friends with benefits
wait don’t you want to go through it to make sure i haven’t forgotten anything
you wore it the night we went iceskating remember
you mean the night that i went iceskating and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia
we made one heck of a team huh
it’s not yours oh my how embarrassing for both of us
hey you broke up with me it is none of your business whose naked bosom i’m smooshing around like pizza dough
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy hmm tables work too good to know
hands off i’m mad at you
look i know it’s a lot of money but the guy at the store said in five to seven years it’ll pay for itself
doesn’t matter what are you mad about
i’m mad at you for blabbing to me what leonard did on the north sea and i’m mad that i’ve had to hide this from penny for two years
and you have every right to be mad about those things so why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month huh i mean don’t even look at it
i mean if penny finds out i’ve known all this time and haven’t told her she’s gonna think i’m a terrible friend i wish you never told me
and i wish leonard never told me he’s the bad guy here
and you let penny marry him compared to that who cares if i bought a george clooney limited edition manscaping kit
hi i’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is really um okay is there any kind of discount for length of marriage ‘cause we’re just talking hours here
all right look i’m sorry i said i was okay with everything before we got married i hate that we’re going through this but i don’t know what to do
if you don’t mind waiting for a groupon we can try marriage counselling
hey uh buddy can we have some privacy
oh of course wouldn’t want to intrude this is yours
okay when i’m done with him i’m gonna need more information
nothing odd i just wanted to rub amy’s nose in it
okay look i might be overreacting but how am i supposed to get past this when i know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman
now forgive me for eavesdropping but as i see it there’s a simple solution
wake up wake up wake up
well right now penny’s imagination is running wild but if they meet that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears like when that sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch
uh first of all you made that guy cry
and we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that
secondly i can’t think of a more horrible idea than penny meeting mandy
what you actually want to meet her
no but now that you’re being weird about it maybe i should
i’m not being weird am i being weird
yes and that’s coming from me
fine you want to meet her
no i just want to know that when you’re at work there’s nothing going on
how many times do i have to tell you i have no interest in this woman
yeah well maybe she has interest in you
in leonard oh even the sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely
i guess my big problem is i never saw leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this
anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment
i don’t know what to think but then again i just found out about it
you know i fell in love with leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys i was used to dating i mean i knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met
come on you know leonard’s not like that
i want to believe you i really do am i being naive
oh i don’t know this is all so new to me i’m still processing
you know he never would’ve done this when we first met he’s cockier now
that’s because you made him more confident
you know if you think about it without you he never would’ve grown into the person he is now i mean sure more women might notice him but i think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice
i never thought about it like that
oh me neither not until just now
hello i’m dr sheldon cooper and welcome to sheldon cooper presents
you guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor
bernadette and i have occasionally gone to one to you know stay on top of things
and i’m just hearing about this now
dude just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that i have to tell you everything that goes on
you don’t have to you should want to
why are marine biologists always so cute
i don’t know but i’d like to get lost in her bermuda triangle
then i won’t say i’d like to cover threequarters of her surface area
not yet this is fun ooh i know i’d let her free my willy where you going
i’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to penny tell her she has nothing to worry about
i’d like to spongebob her squarepants
uh do you mind if i sit
so um i’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat
you know what we did when we were drunk
oh no did i sleep with you too
oh well good for me so what can i do for you
uh okay well um i got married recently
never gets old no no to a girl anyway i told her what happened between you and me and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work
it was just a kiss why would you even tell her
because i didn’t want there to be any secrets between us
i don’t know sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship
no i don’t think so although penny did say exactly that
okay well that’s something to think about
you know on some level i’ve always believed that i don’t deserve a woman like her
oh you’re gonna think about that right here
i mean she’s really beautiful she could have any guy she wants which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me
maybe you should talk to a therapist about this
too expensive you’d think i’d be used to women withholding their love i mean my mother did i mean no matter how hard i tried she just didn’t have any interest in me
i wonder if that’s why i have such a dysfunctional relationship with sheldon i had a dream the other night that i was in a cave and i was nursing a baby but the baby had sheldon’s head on it
and your wife is worried about me
hey leonard when you’re done we came up with a bunch more
and then the czech republic says to slovakia i don’t think you understand how being broken up works can you believe that you’d think that the czech republic would try to hold on to what it had given that it’s not as young as it used to be and i don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders
but enough about the czech republic let’s talk about the time moldova made romania a birthday cake and romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t and yet romania gets dumped i’ll pause here while you mull that one over i know right
so you said you had something to tell me
okay yeah um do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding
i’ve been thinking about it and you might be right but the good news is that i’m pretty sure i know why
penny after all these years i still feel like maybe i don’t deserve you
okay that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with but i get it
yeah yeah sometimes i worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you
i don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me why would i want to be with someone like me
you know what i mean and you know maybe the way i’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this too
well how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together
good because i’ve loved you since the moment we met and i will keep loving you until the end of time
oh oh my god that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me
yeah that’s because you’re beautiful and your beauty fills my heart with love and song
it’s getting kind of cheesy leonard
huh if you think that’s cheesy buckle up penny hofstadter will you please stay married to me
oh damn it you topped it should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official
sheldon i can’t believe you got us a wedding gift
i don’t know why you’re so surprised i watch movies i see what people do
plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in san francisco
yeah there’s fisherman’s wharf and alcatraz and cable cars we’re gonna have so much fun
oh no no i just i said whee
how dare you go on the internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of czechoslovakia
you saw through that one did you
i don’t know what you were thinking but take the video down now
she watched it i’m gonna get that girl back
i only watched it because you emailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad
she was listening through the door she wants me
sure hey want to hear a fun fact about mustard
is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars
well that was fun good for you leonard
hey you’re early the movie doesn’t start for an hour
actually we’re not going to the movies we are here to kidnap you
well you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend
well i’d hardly call this kidnapping where’s the blindfold where’s the duct tape where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and i try to keep you on the phone but you hang up seconds before i can trace it and then i say i’m getting too old for this crud
yeah penny packed you a bag
you’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend
oh not just him you’re coming too
oh and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that
i told you to put tape on his mouth
and i told you he bit me
it’s bad enough i’m being taken against my will i don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon
well sheldon there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting
this van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero richard feynman
yeah a buddy of mine let me borrow it
this was feynman’s van that’s so cool
yeah nothing’s been changed since he drove it
i bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy
yeah and talked about physics with them
so are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed
uh okay let’s see they’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea
leonard don’t be fooled i’m from texas mehico is spanish for mexico
uh mariachi bands wild dogs beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside
okay calm down there’s a theme to this weekend we are going to mexico in feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house feynman bought with the money from his nobel prize
come on leonard’s doing bachelor stuff you sure we can’t take you to a strip club
nah if i want to see a naked dancing man i just flush the toilet while leonard’s in the shower
i know we’re not making a fuss but in the spirit of bachelorette parties i made cookies in the shape of male genitals
you really didn’t have to whoa that is anatomic
thank you the veins are gummy worms
oh that’s leonard he said they’re about to cross the border
i hope the boys don’t get too crazy in mexico
oh yeah right lock up your daughters or sheldon might lecture them about the north american free trade agreement
boy that was a long night for me
uhoh according to this mexican customs website visitors may not bring more than five laser discs 20 compact discs or 12 vhs tapes
we don’t have any of those
how can you be sure vhs was king when feynman drove this van for all we know there are hidden compartments lousy with jane fonda workout videos
if there was a hidden compartment don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now
are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations
you don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to mexico
you can never be too careful i got one last year before i went to epcot
oh it’s good i just wish leonard would work up the courage to tell sheldon he’s moving in here
you guys still aren’t living together
we are i mean he sleeps here but it’s only a matter of time before sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the leonardshaped pile of pillows
speaking of sheldon how’s single life treating you
fine i guess i’ve been focusing on me i was thinking about changing my wardrobe
but then i decided i don’t want to go changing who i am just because of some man
you know it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup
actually i was thinking of making one small change
you really never had that done
my mom said pierced ears were for whores pirates and genies
okay well you’re a grown woman now
i know but sheldon had this clause in the relationship agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a klingon
we’ll take you to the mall to get it done
why i can do it right here
really you have a piercing gun
no all you need is a needle and an ice cube i’ve done it like a dozen times
oh come on i’ll be gentle let me take your ear virginity
hey watch your speed i hear the mexican police target tourists
oh not a problem if anything goes down we just put koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head
dude how many races can you offend in a single breath
i don’t know have you watched the olympics with me
sheldon can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century it’s like the batmobile if batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool
perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us maybe between this and his beach house we will be inspired to greatness
i usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans however even i must admit feeling richard feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing
hey i have to return this van keep your creative juices in your pants
what if it’s banditos shooting at us what if we get kidnapped what if we end up in a factory making bart simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives
i am getting too old for this crud
amy i noticed your status still says in a relationship on facebook
you’re right i should probably let all of my facebook friends know penny i’m no longer in a relationship
did you change yours to married yet
uh no not yet there’s still a few people i haven’t told personally
oh just my parents and my entire family
well i don’t want to hurt my dad you know he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding
they started to then her water broke you know if he finds out we eloped it’s gonna break his heart
how long do you think you can keep it from him
yeah isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait
well not necessarily you know dad’s not getting any younger so if i wait long enough i’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical
when did you learn how to change a tyre
every selfrespecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road
if i see one scorpion i am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down
are you turning it the right way
no i took the other four off and when i got to this one i thought you know i’m in a rut let’s shake things up
here let me try you’re right it doesn’t turn the other way
there you go you’re all done
that wasn’t so bad nice boy if my mom could see me now she’d lock me in the sin closet
actually the joke was on her i could still see the tv through the slats
i’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close
bet she’d still tell her if she got married
you’re not gonna let this go are you
well it’s kind of sad that they don’t know i mean they love leonard
fine you want me to call i’ll call why am i so nervous
it’s understandable amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with sheldon
yeah how did it go did she make you crawl into the breakingup drawer
uh well actually to be honest i haven’t told her yet
you’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about sheldon
i’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss i don’t know what you’re talking about
fine i’m calling home but when i’m done you’re calling your mother
easy for you to say you never had to watch 60 minutes like this
ah she took your brother out to celebrate he just got his tenth onemonth sober chip yeah she’s gonna make him a little necklace
okay i’ll talk to her later uh dad there’s something i need to tell you leonard and i got married
last week i’m sorry i should’ve told you it was a spur of the moment thing i feel terrible please don’t be too disappointed
well then i’m happy for you
aw thank you daddy that means so much
well i understand it’s hard to tell someone something if you think it’s gonna upset ’em
it is you’re the best dad ever
yeah uh hold that thought i’ve been sitting on a little news myself
you know that rototiller i got for the tractor
oh you should see it it is a beautiful piece of machinery anyway uh i backed over your pet pig with it
yeah he’s uh not dancing anymore
i did not kill him the vet took care of that
you didn’t tell me for a year
well apple doesn’t fall far from the tree does it love ya slugger gotta go
it’s called lamaze breathing it helps you push
great he’s pushing with his uterus
there’s got to be a smarter way of removing it
yeah this is nothing more than a physics problem
right archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it and i shall move the world
of course all we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this
exactly i’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever
let’s see a lever a lever
everybody hold on let’s take this problem one step at a time first we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver and the sooner we decide it’s leever the sooner we can roll up our sleeves not slehves and get to work
before i made that call my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my greatgrandmother
no he was a beloved member of the family
it’s not funny you’re up call your mother
oh maybe later your pig dying made me sad and a little hungry
you saw that huh hi mom how are you doing oh good how’s work that’s nice i’m fine hey listen i’ve been meaning to ask how come aunt doe and aunt florence never got along
okay just give me that amy broke up with sheldon she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies hang on she wants to talk to you
i don’t think the lever’s working
there’s gotta be something else we could try
if this was star trek we could use a phaser to blast it off
no it’s too broad of a beam you’d need something more precise like superman’s heat vision
ooh the green lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it
if you need a green hand why not just use the hulk
oh please the hulk would never get across the border with that temper
guys excuse me not that calling one of the avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice but we’re scientists don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science
yes we could use science but it’s your bachelor party lighten up
we will we will percussive shock you
we will we will percussive shock you
buddy you’re a boy make a big noise playin’ in the street gonna be a big man someday you got mud on your face you big disgrace kickin’ your can all over the place i have an eidetic memory sometimes it’s a curse
i had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source
they’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat let’s hope the lug nut expands
what if that burning food attracts animals
we have plenty of food for the animals
yep a sixfoot wiener in a flash tshirt
it’s a bachelor party lighten up
it’s burning salsa i’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off
what an innovative solution perhaps i don’t give your mit education enough credit
yeah i saw it on mythbusters
all right this rust combined with the aluminium recovered from the van is now thermite
great couple of pinches ought to do the trick
is that enough to melt the lug nut
well let’s start small we can always add more
you put up a good fight lug nut but you’ve met your match
hey look the lug nut’s off
what what are you doing back
we got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off
if it makes you feel any better i pierced amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet
my dad killed my pig with his tractor
i spent the night in mexico with sheldon
what a wonderful day thank you
oh we’re glad you had fun
blue icees and a trip to the container store it’s like i died and went to the postmortem neuroninduced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven
i still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie you’re a young man
age is a state of mind leonard in here i’m 90 why are you taking your bins over there
it’s just where i need them you know she doesn’t have a lot of closet space
uh well honey you know now that leonard and i are married it kind of makes sense that we actually live together
so that’s all this day was a plan to butter me up before delivering bad news
no i thought we were friends you asked for a sip of my icee if you had your own straw i might’ve said yes
sheldon please we already feel bad about this
you know what they don’t sell at the container store something large enough to contain my disappointment although if anyone did it would be them
thank you for letting me come speak with you
as my relationships with penny and amy are currently strained i’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement
i tried reaching out to my mother but she was in bible study leonard’s mother is on a book tour my meemaw was taking a nap and after a while siri started repeating her answers
yeah i know top ten pretty exciting
well in addition to amy leaving me leonard’s moving in with penny it’s difficult not to feel abandoned
well why don’t you look at this as an opportunity you had other roommates before leonard maybe this is a chance to find someone new
perhaps i could find someone better than leonard someone i can rub in his face chris pratt’s all the rage right now i wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom
hey you know who would be the perfect roomie
stuart he’s been living with us for a while now i’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair
well sheldon’s looking for a roommate
have you seen this archie comic it’s actually archie versus predator
i don’t know maybe jughead’s a terminator
do you guys know any musicians
i was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week you know give this place more of a staying in business vibe
what kind of music are you thinking of
i like all kinds of music but my favourite genre is free
hey we’ve always talked about playing together
well it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing
oh we could play filk music
it’s been around for years it’s like folk music but with a scififantasy theme
i like it it sounds exactly like something i shouldn’t be expected to pay for
dude if we do this we’re gonna need a cool band name
you know i’ve actually had one i’ve been sitting on for years
it was for this power trio i tried to put together in junior high but i was short two friends
me too but i uh might have lyme disease
just a few more signatures and we’ll be finished initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key okay as my future neighbour i’d like you to have a key initial here to acknowledge you received it
i’m proud of you you’re taking this really well
well it’s not like i’m never going to see you two again which brings us to article 23 subsection c please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion
do i really have to do that now
no but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish that’s on you all right oh and lastly please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen in which case all glory to the hive queen all right now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document and we will officially no longer be roommates
let me help you l e o n
so i have an idea for a filk song it’s kind of a a power ballad superhero crossover tale of epic proportions
is it cold in here ’cause oh my
okay so it’s a it’s a david and goliath story it’s about man against god it’s called hammer and whip the untold story of thor versus indiana jones
thor versus indiana jones you just blew my filking mind
okay i don’t have it all worked out yet but i was thinking something like um oh indy oh indy the skies are so windy is that a flying man with a killer bod wait that’s no man it’s a norse god
oh yes definitely hang on thunder clapped as thor raised his mighty hammer indy rapped that’s one bad mammajamma
that is that is so good
right mammajamma just came to me
okay and here’s the hook thor and dr jones thor and dr jones one plays with lightning the other plays with bones
thor and dr jones thor and dr jones one plays with lightning the other plays with bones
hey remember the ark of the covenant
that’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off
i appreciate your interest in the apartment i just need to ask you a few standard questions
it says here you’re a chemist which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches
looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem
in general would you say that you smell better worse or the same as you do right now
i was going to ask you what is the best fruit but then i realized what i want to ask you is why is there a bandaid on your forearm but then i realized what i really want to ask you is just can you just go
you’re healthy you have a job in the sciences i’ve got to say if this credit report comes back good you’re the frontrunner
i’m not gonna be your roommate sheldon
but i met with 11 people and they all walked out and that hollywood phoney chris pratt never tweeted me back
i’m sure you’ll find somebody else
i suppose what happened to me amy years ago i was completely disengaged from my feelings i’d say it was a happier time but i was disengaged from my feelings so who can tell
i don’t know how to help you you know feelings are a part of life
they didn’t used to be you and leonard and penny you all poisoned me with emotions i was like the tin man perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart
i don’t think that was the point of the movie
fine then i was like pinocchio before that jerk geppetto went and made him a real boy
so what are you thinking for dinner
well honey you don’t live with sheldon any more you can have anything you want
you’re right but what mexican italian german indian greek cuban chinese pizza barbecue korean korean barbecue
hey we’re going to dinner you want to come
oh i wish i could but i realized i’ve become too emotionally vulnerable so like an operating system i’m restoring my life to the last stable version which was in 2003 the day before i met leonard
hang on wait you actually think it’s 2003
no just because i’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean i’m delusional and since it is 2003 i don’t know who you are so please exit the premises before i call the police on my stylish new flip phone
i guess i’m just you know worried about sheldon
well come on he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s he’s fine
what else can you do move back in with him
no of course not i just feel bad
well so do i but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom you know not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning
i did like that he had the weather on it
trust me this is the right thing
i know and it’s not like we’re abandoning him plus we can facetime him whenever we want you know once iphones are invented in his universe
i can’t believe sheldon asked you to be his roommate
i can’t believe he ran my credit
hey if you’re open to living with someone great i’ll give you a thousand dollars to take stuart
you really should’ve gone on the internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one
i’m sorry i just thought you might have a pasty weirdoshaped hole in your life
hey i know sheldon’s quirky but he’s also brilliant and insightful i think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair
hey we brought you thai where is everything
in my present it’s in the future in your present it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man i met in the home depot parking lot
i know what you’re doing you’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you but it’s not happening
no what i’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me
will you knock it off we’re across the hall
as the kids are saying today talk to the hand
thor and dr jones thor and dr jones one runs from loki the other runs from stones so what do you think
runs from stones means that that big boulder but i couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder
right yeah right but what do you think
cute it’s not cute cute is children dressed as vegetables
just be honest you don’t like it
i didn’t say that i i just like music you can dance to
you can dance to this um uh uh thor and dr jones thor and dr jones one plays with lightning the other plays with bones
i’m telling you dude the song has no groove you can’t dance to it
who cares i thought the whole point of footprints on the moon was to write songs that make people think
you can do both like michael jackson’s billie jean while you’re dancing you’re thinking like darn it whose baby is it
where’s this coming from a few hours ago we both loved this song
i still love it i just think there’s room for improvement
you played it for emily didn’t you
you are such a wimp she didn’t like it now you don’t like it
no no i’m just evolving as a musician you’re the one who’s stuck in the past
the past was lunch you know what’s really happening here your girlfriend is breaking up our band
she has nothing to do with this i am my own man
oh please your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to sleep with you
really remember when you were gonna get circumcised for rachel bernstein
that had nothing to do with rachel it was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury
i don’t need this i’m quitting the band
then get out of my house
buddy i know me moving in with penny feels like a big change but it’s not
how can you say that amy’s gone and you two are married now so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone too
okay you don’t know what’s gonna happen
no i do eventually you’ll want more space and you’ll move into a house and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week it’ll only be a couple of times a month and then it’ll only be on special occasions like when bernadette divorces wolowitz or or or like when koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body or amy’s wedding where she’s marrying someone better than me
okay look we don’t need to rush into anything all right maybe instead of leonard moving in with me we just leave things the way they are and sometimes we’ll sleep over there and sometimes we’ll sleep over here
wuh what about what you said in the restaurant
well it’s not forever it’s just for a while if you want we can think of him like he’s our dog
you can i’m happy when you come home and i’m scared of fireworks by the way on july fourth we’re all sleeping here
all right great just give me one minute and i’ll get started on a new roommate agreement yeah nothing from pratt we’re good
indy’ whip snapped thor’s hammer missed
indy held his ground and straightened his fedora
thor said that’s a nice look in nineteen fourtyfoura
thor and dr jones thor and dr jones one plays with lightning the other plays with bones thor and dr jones thor and dr jones one plays with lightning the other plays with bones
play something we can dance to
is that the prototype drive system for the highg rover
no bernadette got me a fitbit so she can track how much i’m exercising
that’ll teach her to care about your health
yeah i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i die young
when was the last actual exercise you got
the other day when she tried to put that fitbit on me and i ran away from her
according to a recent study simply thinking about exercise even while sitting still can have physical benefits for all you know i could be exercising right now
it wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active
you make an excellent point ooh i think i’m getting a runner’s high
look at all these activities the university has rock climbing club archery flag football
had me at flag lost me at football
yeah i think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise but do you really think sports is the right choice for you
what are you saying we’re not coordinated enough to play sports
okay leonard sweetheart you twisted your ankle playing scrabble
i got a tripleword score with a double letter q if that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance what’s the point of having one hey barry kripke started a fencing club
interesting sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal and i would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport
no throwing no catching no running
no gym shorts that can be yanked down
and as an added bonus the word touché comes from fencing it would be our only opportunity to use it in a nonmetaphorical sense
what about a game of tag on a french schoolyard
sure so how can we help
well i know more women are buying comics than ever but for some reason i i can’t get ’em in here
all right well what have you tried so far
uh i’ve i’ve been stocking more femaleoriented titles uh in the bathroom i folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle and uh you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area
really in a comic book store
oh don’t worry i i’ve got a camera right up here so i could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs anyway so what do i got to do to to get you in the door
well for starters you might want to rethink some of this artwork i mean this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog
well you don’t know the backstory maybe she kept jumping up on the couch
i feel cool like puss in boots
i always wanted to be a swashbuckler when i was a kid
technically swashbuckler is a combination of two terms swash referring to the sound of the sword swash and then buckler meaning a small shield which you don’t have
gentlemen welcome to the fencing cwub before we start i just want to warn you fencing isn’t a joke i hope you’re not here because you think it’s going to be wike star wars
yeah i’m here because i think it’s gonna be like game of thrones
and maybe a little princess bride
ooh ooh i forgot about princess bride that’s my answer
well sowwy to disappoint you but fencing is a sewious spowt if you’re not wiwwing to put in the effowt you might as well just weave now
we’re not afraid of physical activity
yeah i already ran 18 miles today
awwight let’s begin with some fundamentals this is the en garde position feet are in an l heels in a stwaight wine elbow is about a fist from the wib cage notice my dominant weg faces fowward
well i’m not sure i have a dominant leg they’re both pretty submissive
when you’re in a public restroom which foot do you flush the toilet with
okay show me en garde good knees bent swightwy over the toe nonsword hand up for bawance
oh god i am going to feel this tomorrow
the first move is called an advance you move your fwont foot fowward heel to toe back foot fowwows so fwont foot fowward heel to toe back foot fowwows now you twy advance and advance and advance
this is easy i didn’t need to wear a cup
good the next move is called a wetweat step back back foot first toe to heel fwont foot fowwows on thwee
when can i stab one of my friends
in fencing we don’t call it a stab we call it a touch
uh yes i’m aware but if i say i want to touch one of my friends i’ll get called into human resources
okay on thwee cooper and koothwappawi advance the other two wetweat one two thwee vewy good switch it up one two thwee switch again one two thwee phone rings excuse me can i call you back no i’m teaching a cwass sure sure an hour tops yeah okay okay yeah okay thanks and one two thwee
have you thought about advertising directly to females
hmm okay well alright what if i put up a sign in the window that said women come in don’t be afraid
hey have you read the online reviews for this place
eh the internet’s so negative i try to avoid it
all right well heather h says the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once kelly m says the creepy guy who runs it asked me out then called himself stupid before i could say no jessica k says i told the weird owner that i liked his shirt he took it off and gave it to me
with your foil extended kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg now you twy and again and again
look at us we’re like the rockettes
en garde leonard prepare yourself for a rigorous touching
my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
i thought you were puss in boots
oh yeah right sorry my name is puss in boots you killed my father prepare to die
i’m looking forward to him teaching us gloveslapping

again that doctor didn’t insult your honour just checked your prostate
my name is little orphan annie you killed my father prepare to die
my name is darth vader i am your father prepare to die
well good it’s nice to see your mind off amy
not that it’s any of your business but she broke up with me
good to know what’s that supposed to mean
oh i hate to say it but it sounds like he’s interested in her
oh buddy i get that you don’t like it but it’s not really up to you
yeah but he’s dumb and his face is dumb
look even if it’s not him amy’s probably going to date someone at some point
of course she deserves to be happy
listen i should warn you that maybe asking amy out isn’t a good idea
and now the crazy version of what i just said
if you intend to pursue amy you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it
and how are you gonna do that
by challenging you to a duel
you’ve had one wesson i’ll destwoy you
that is why the duel will take place at high noon three years from today if you’re worth your salt as an instructor i should be ready by then yeah and be warned i’m going to touch you all over
wow that that was crazier than i thought
all right i’m not saying it’s true but let’s let’s consider for a moment that possibly i’m the problem
okay fine what i mean what can i do i get so nervous around women
well you’re talking to us now i mean you don’t seem nervous
well that’s ’cause i’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked by the way thumbs up ladies
do you not hear how creepy that sounds
okay don’t be offended but what went wrong with you
i i guess i assumed at this point in my life i would be married or in a relationship or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself
i mean i can’t say for sure but i swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car anyway the longer i’m alone the more desperate i get
stuart believe it or not i understand you know before i met sheldon i was alone for a really long time i was so desperate for people to like me when i met these guys it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity
okay we’re all feeling it yes i’ll go out with you
suddenly the rabbit thing makes sense
i’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar sheldon
look at this blister like it or not we’re athletes now besides a bar is where i belong i’m having female problems
if you’re cranky and retaining water i have a theory
sheldon instead of focusing on amy dating other guys maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl
why you never thought you’d end up in a relationship and then you met amy maybe there’s someone else out there for you
true but penny’s married and so is bernadette and your girlfriend has red hair and white skin which really rubs up against my clown phobia
maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends
there’s that prostate doctor but i’m still mad at her oh there’s a woman i’ll make her my girlfriend
whoa whoa walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work
you’re forgetting something ladies love jocks
how many sips of that beer did he have
excuse me i’m recovering from a recent breakup and i’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better and as ash ketchum said to pikachu i choose you
i don’t know what that means
well we gave it a shot how about you
ah what might have been and you give my regards to barnum and bailey
stuart took that rejection like a pro
well he knew he was on the breast cam
i don’t have much experience turning men down it wasn’t so much fun
oh you get used to it some guys you have to turn down over and over
and sometimes we marry them anyway
barry kripke just asked me out
oh look at you two guys in one day
i told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows
hi how are you i was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime
well what are you gonna do
i don’t know i guess i assumed that i would eventually date other people but this is happening so fast
well i was hoping the next person i dated would be a little less like sheldon
i think she means not a weirdo
all right well what happens if you imagine him naked
oh i don’t have to imagine it
i smell funny i taste salty
and kind of delicious i wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me
i know it only takes one doctor’s finger
we should let you guys talk
i’m doing all right i tried fencing today
it was pretty easy and i think my background in mathletics helped barry kripke was there i should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out
well actually he he already did
okay but don’t get too attached to him in two years 364 days he’s a dead man
interesting i asked two women out today and they both said no
i didn’t know you were interested in dating
i’ve been told it’s a good way to move on
oh okay anyway um it’s nice to see you you look good
thanks and i taste good too
why does your fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday
before i tell you perhaps i should soften the blow you’re face is pleasingly symmetrical
a swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our superfluid vortex experiment
oh well that kind of stinks
that kind of stinks why aren’t you more upset did i soften the blow too much because this here is more like a picasso painting
what are we going to do
i’d love to but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month
a month what are you kidding me that would have been a good time for you to soften the blow
that shirt brings out the blue in your eyes
let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve
did you know that i almost didn’t wear this shirt today
hey barry we’re in trouble we need liquid helium does the department have any we can use
sowwy there’s a showtage and what we do have i need for my quantum excitation study
but you won’t need much for that
twue but if it’s successful i’m having a pawty with bawwoons
come on barry there’s a swedish team trying to run our experiment before us can’t you spare any
be honest if the shoe was on the other foot would you do this for me
he said be honest so i was honest didn’t your mother tell you it’s the best policy so what do you say
why do you need kripke can’t you just go to party city for helium
we’d have to go to every party city in california
sounds like you on cinco de mayo
hey people were still talking about that party on siete de mayo
leonard if that swedish team beats us i will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again which is a shame because swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpickdelivered meatball
if you need liquid helium so bad i know a guy who can get you some if you don’t ask too many questions
how does he get the helium
how many questions are too many questions
hey you know who went out on a date the other night stuart
so is she like homeless or framing him for a crime
he’s using some kind of dating app on his phone
oh which one maybe we can get amy to try it
i don’t know stuart can you come in here he tried to explain it to me it shows you pictures of people nearby you swipe them around it looks kind of like a game
oh and if you lose the game you have to go out with stuart
can you show us that dating app
oh yeah sure this thing has changed my life
wow so how many girls have you met
two i probably don’t need to mention there’s an entire number between that and zero
well so how does it work
uh well it it shows me all the single women in a fivemile radius who are using the app if i like the way they look i hit thumbs up if i don’t thumbs down
oh what would make you give a girl a thumbs down
first time it happens i will let you know
oh hey i just heard back from the liquid helium guy
he’s got what we need and can meet us tonight
really you know i don’t like buying things at night january 7th 2009 i went to the ralph’s at 11
the man restocking the cereal shelves
that’s right and what did he do
he handed you the box directly and called you stretch
do you want liquid helium or not
of course i do i don’t want that swedish team scooping us
then i’m going to tell him we’re in
leonard wait this is highly unethical
we’re just bending the rules a little we have grant money to do the experiment so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need it’s not like when dr goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a russian girl in an apartment in van nuys
was she helping him with his research
sure so are we doing this
well but where does he get the helium
remember don’t ask too many questions
uh but this is violating university code
a little but if i may quote einstein the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man
huh all right do it tell him we’re in
i can’t find that quote on the internet did you make that up
before i answer may i just say your skin has never looked better
aren’t you just made of sugar
i’m not sure how i feel about this
oh come on just let him put the app on your phone
yeah stuart got two dates with it
one of which would’ve ended in sex had she not said no okay all set
okay let me see nope nope nope oh he’s cute
doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone
hey i thought you were gonna be out late
if you wanted me to stay out later you should’ve given me more spending money
what are you guys up to
we put amy on a dating app and we’re seeing what’s out there
oh fun let me see uh no no uh definitely not
what was wrong with that guy
uh he’s indian we’ve already got one of those ooh we should find a nice latino really round us out
uh excuse me can i have my phone back
hang on i’m trying to find you the next great love of your life the man who will father your children okay yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks
oh of course an nondescript white panel van you may be familiar with it from the sentence their bodies were found in a nondescript white panel van
uh i’m leonard this is my friend…
wait hold on hold on how do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away
exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us you give us the helium first
oh how do i know you’re not gonna drive away without paying me
guess i’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas
look you can trust us we’re respected scientists
well he is i’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself it’s ironic but the point is we can’t trust you you’re a sketchy character in a parking garage
yeah well from my perspective that’s how you two appear to me
well i never thought of it like that boy frame of reference will just sneak up on you won’t it
my friend does make a decent point about the money i don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front
ah no money no helium seems we’re at a uh stalemate
not technically in chess a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves uh you have plenty of moves available you could beat us up and steal the money you could kill us you know really you’re only limited by your imagination
huh all these years i’ve been using stalemate when i really mean impasse i feel foolish
i don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a mexican standoff what are we gonna do here
oh whoa whoa how can it bea mexican standoff everybody knows you need three sides for that
not necessarily uh many argue the essence of a mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm
let me give you an example earlier today i decoded the headers on your email and i know that your name is kenneth fitzgerald from that i figured out where you live and where you work now to make this a mexican standoff i would say something like uh you give us the helium or i’ll turn you in to the authorities
yeah exactly see you’re getting it
yeah well i know where you work all right and if you mess with me i’ll report you then i’ll pound your asses into the ground
perfect now we really are in a mexican standoff is this one of those times where i’ve won the battle but lost the war
i told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night
all right let’s all just calm down nobody wants to report anybody
no i don’t like this i’m out
no no no wait don’t go just let me explain we’re physicists and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year
spacetime can be interpreted as the surface of an ndimensional superfluid
hmm could be could be go on
okay but now there’s this swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery we really need this helium
and i’m sorry i lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love although i am currently single if you know anybody
here’s the money can we do this
okay it’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off i expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in sweden
it’s actually pretty common in our field there’s not much you can do about it
well for the right amount of money if you know where they live there’s uh plenty we could do about it
did you hear that leonard there’s plenty we could do about it do you have a card
okay here we go now everyone can see all right where do we stand on crosseyed mike
you know he won’t be looking at other girls
unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose
okay okay okay thumbs down next
ew check out his tiny teeth he looks like a mandolphin
well if he’s good in bed she can throw him a fish
i love you amy dolphin noises
okay i’m starting to feel guilty aren’t we being a little mean
that’s a fair point we wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face
you may want to leave the room
will you stop with that already
i’m trying not to attract attention
and tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that
she said buenas noches what was he supposed to do
leonard we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught
well you can’t be sure of that what if the helium dealer rats us out what if kripke asks where we got it what if the university checks my family tree and finds out i don’t have an uncle harvey
the dealer doesn’t care kripke has no authority over us and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot help me hook this up
well did you see this sticker
it’s partially torn off but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter u
yeah but what if it’s property of us government there’s a national helium reserve in amarillo texas if this was stolen from there we’re accessories to a federal crime
let’s not jump to conclusions a lot of things start with u
that’s true there’s the us air force us department of defence us navy you and i are going to jail
listen we can do the experiment as planned and beat the swedish team to the punch or we can kiss our dreams goodbye because we were to afraid to break a few rules
okay does everyone remember the rules if he’s shirtless one sip posing with a pet two sips pet and shirtless chug like it’s your job and pull
i had a great time last night
you went on a date last night are you seeing someone
no it it’s not like that
and i’d love to take you out again”
yeah well normally i wouldn’t but my daughter’s having a sleepover and there’s only so much screaming and katy perry a man can take
anyway if you could just give us our money back you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way
yeah well is there something wrong with it
no nothing we just changed our mind
he has glasses and i’m a knowitall we are not built for prison
yeah i hear you well you’re good guys so i’ll uh i’ll take the helium off your hands
but you ain’t getting your money back
you’re taking advantage of us we clarified nomenclature together
look i enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy but uh this is business
you know what it’s fine keep the money we just want to be done with this
no problem but i am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee
well it better not be more than a thousand dollars that’s all i’ve got on me
that’s exactly how much it is
i can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it
yeah why wouldn’t you tell us
because it’s new and weird and i’m just trying to figure it all out and i knew if i told you guys i had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it
so are we allowed to ask how it’s going
it’s going fine it’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee
what i thought we were all… never mind
i i thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people
well i don’t have much experience dating so i decided it would be good for me to you know get out there a little
and how many guys have you gone out with
well the swedes might beat us but at least we won’t get gangnoogied in prison
is ernest goes to jail the only prison movie you’ve seen
hey i’ve been thinking i was being petty you can have my hewium
but you have to add my name to your paper
i don’t know seems fair you can’t do it without me
can you give us a minute
take your time i’ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect
i don’t like being extorted like this especially by him of all people
me neither but what other choice do we have
i promise this is the last time
it says right here on wikipedia a mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties
how can you trust wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties
or amongst if they were feeling whimsically archaic
all right enough with the chitchat are we gonna watch ernest goes to jail or not
absolutely but don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow
did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life
hmm i’m doing okay and i was very popular at 13
oh no at home the servants would sing to me laugh at my jokes i wish i knew their names
does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids
you tell me you woke up in bed with one
listen to this i just received an email from wil wheaton leonard nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away it’s about mr spock and his impact on our culture
why is he writing to you
well they’re looking for fans to interview and wil thought i’d be good for it
absolutely not yeah penny you spent some time in front of the camera any words of advice
yes don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so
this is a documentary about mr spock i’m sure if there’s nudity it will be tasteful
not really visigoths are kind of up my butt right now
howard uhoh make room visigoths ‘sup
we need to talk about redecorating this place
look i get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way but i want this to feel like my house too
oh honey of course it’s your house why else would you be cleaning it all the time
all right let’s start over i’m redecorating the furniture the carpeting the walls i’m changing everything that depresses me when i look at it try not to be one of those things
is it about how i can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died
hello amy it’s sheldon yeah i i know that we’re broken up but i’m leaving this message because i thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about mr spock or as i like to call it a spockumentary yeah i’m going to use that joke in the interview so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time you know hysterically hmm and with a tinge of sadness that i’m no longer in your life
i’m the one who thought of spockumentary
and i’m laughing like i did the first time i heard it
hey sheldon this is adam nimoy
oh it’s nice to meet you i admire your father’s work very much it’s not every day i get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum
i told you this guy is gold
oh making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left but before she died
okay listen i’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house
let’s just redo one room and see how it goes
that is reasonable but what room
no way no this is the room i associate the most with my mom
i want to change my answer
i guess we didn’t use it very often unless we had company which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
great i’m gonna go pick out paint samples
all right we’re just gonna have a conversation pretend the camera’s not here
all right but this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt
how long have you known adam
and what are you getting him back for
let’s start with your name and occupation
dr sheldon cooper theoretical physicist caltech
and what is your earliest memory of the character spock
the first episode of star trek
what was it about spock that appealed to you
i think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere the dream of a cold rational world entirely without human emotion spock came from a planet governed only by logic you know on vulcan when your brother asks why are you hitting yourself the answer is i’m not you’re moving my arm to which he says fascinating and then you both watch educational television
aw when he says things like that i just want to hug him and make everything better
my brother was mean to me too
yeah you probably had it coming
do you have any spock collectibles
i have many my most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend penny that’s her over there
hi look at that i’m in a movie my shirt stayed on
of course excuse me this will just take a moment
when did we get a wall safe
when there was no more room in the floor safe
when did we get a floor safe
when we got the security camera
aquaman protecting your home since 2012
oh my god we’ve done things on that couch
yeah you don’t have to tell me
so your fatherinlaw is in there right now
yes so back me up the house is good the way it is
hey raj dad and i were just talking about taking down this wall
you sure it’s a pretty great wall
i’m sorry i did what i could
seriously you brought raj over to take your side
he’s not on my side he’s doing all the work for free
that is so generous of you i’d like to switch sides
look uh i don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s loadbearing
well it’s easy to find out just go into the crawlspace under the house and check
not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth so we are currently in the presence of leonard nimoy’s dna
um doesn’t adam count as leonard nimoy’s dna
no offence but this is pure 100 nimoy because of your mother you’re only 50 which isn’t bad but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away
okay enough about the napkin what else you hiding in there
all right then see just my valuables my passport uh my will
yeah my 118 scale wil wheaton action figure i also have the other kind of will and in it i will my wil back to wil
oh that is an engagement ring that i was going to give my girlfriend amy
no no this has been in my family for generations except for a short time when comanches cut off my greatgreatgreatgrandmother’s finger and stole it
no the texas rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them it was a happy ending well for my ninefingered nana
okay back to the ring does amy even know about this
no she broke up with me before i could broach the subject
oh man i’m sorry that must have been devastating for you
no not at all no i’m fine you know amy had reservations about our relationship so all worked out for the best
i said i’m fine long pause we’ve gotten a little offtopic allow me to make things entertaining again in this little spockumentary that was leonard’s joke as a child when faced with a dilemma my mother encouraged me to ask what would jesus do the answer to that was always love thy neighbour but my neighbour had a dead tooth so that wasn’t going to happen but that’s why i changed it to what would spock do
yes oh for example three years ago when i discovered penny was eating all my poptarts instead of getting angry or vindictive you know i got a floor safe
i knew i could smell ’em
what about from when you were a kid
oh certainly uh when i was eight years old billy sparks cornered me in the playground i asked myself what would spock do then i grabbed billy on his shoulder and performed my first vulcan nerve pinch
oh no he broke my collarbone i can still hear it click
that must have been very upsetting for you
oh not at all as i said the entire point of emulating spock was to rise above human emotion which i’ve spent a lifetime mastering
no you went pfft what does pfft mean
all right fine well sheldon i’m no expert but aren’t you completely missing the point of spock i mean he liked to act like he had no emotions but he was still half human
i’m just saying you pretend you don’t but you have feelings just like everybody else
not true no look at me i had an engagement ring to give a girl and instead she rejected me and am i emotional about that no no i am sitting here on a couch talking about my favourite tv character like nothing happened ‘cause i am just like him all logical all the time
because when i speak at a regular volume no one seems to believe me that i’ve put this amy nonsense behind me
this documentary is gonna be awesome
you gonna be okay down here
yeah yeah i feel like an archaeologist indiana jones and the singlefamily dwelling hey look found a seashell
relax there’s enough droppings down here without you making more
sorry do you have a sense of where we are
yeah i think that’s the den
oh okay so we must be under the dining room
uhhuh yep you know i know you don’t want to hear this but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery
why wouldn’t i want to hear it
‘cause bernie said you didn’t want kids
that’s not true at all i wish she’d get pregnant believe me i’m climbing on top of her every chance i get in a loving and respectful manner the point is i really do want kids
i don’t know why she’s lying to you she’s the one who doesn’t want kids in fact every time i bring up the subject…
oh my god we’re gonna die
i can’t believe sheldon was gonna ask amy to marry him
i know i also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it
better did wil and adam leave
do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary
well there’s no point in dwelling on it as the vulcans say kupfuntor ha’kiv na’ish du stau
do you know what that means
well this is ridiculous being upset about amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything if i want to resolve this situation then i need to take action
i’m going to find her and ask her to marry me and if she says yes we can put this behind us and resume our relationship and if she says no well then she can just ponfo miran
so i should probably explain why i kind of fibbed
i told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because i didn’t want to disappoint him
but you were okay throwing me under the bus
turns out yeah i didn’t think twice about it
bernie you don’t need to worry about me but i don’t want to see you miss out raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life
oh please mom did everything all you did was come home from work sit on the couch and drink beer how is that raising kids
this is really a conversation for husband and wife i’m gonna go clean up hit the road if your mother asks i was here till ten
it’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and howard doesn’t help either so in a way howard’s not only like your father but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have
fine i’ll leave but it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper
all right i admit that i don’t help out a lot and i need to work on that but if we had a kid it would be different
because when my dad left i promised myself that if i ever had a chance to be a father i’d always be there
and this an actual i’ll think about it not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar i’ll think about it”
it’s an actual i’ll think about it
i really believe i’d be a great dad
speaking of making babies what do you say i wash up and poke around your crawlspace
because she feels i don’t all i know is logic
yeah right you can just shut your feelings off there goes television lying to us again we let you raise our children and this is the thanks we get leonard how could i have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a madeup alien race with no emotions
well now instead of idolizing fictional characters you can focus on the real people who are already in your life
they’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television
i think it’s so adorable you’re making sheldon breakfast
well he’s having a rough time amy broke his heart the dvr cut off the last minute of doctor who that crow followed him home
aren’t you worried you’re making french toast on oatmeal day
ah well what’s this a pot of oatmeal or thanks to you what i will now call gloatmeal
oh i don’t want credit for that
oh dr and mrs hofstadter lovely to see you this fine morning
yeah i am indeed i have decided instead of wallowing in sadness about amy it is time that i find myself a new female companion
i realized something when amy was in my life i was hyperfocused on my work and ignored her
and you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman
no i need a new woman in my life to ignore so i can hyperfocus on my work again
hey i made french toast sticks
ooh that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl you know what you eat it you’re married it doesn’t matter what you look like
don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow
thank you for coming by gentlemen
well it was the two of you who found amy farrah fowler for me now that i’m looking for my next girlfriend it seemed only logical that i employ your services once again
you sure you’re up for that she did hurt you
oh no it’s all right i think of my time with amy as a stick of fruit stripe gum sweet and enjoyable at first but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness
you’re not wrong about fruit stripe i was always a hubba bubba man
hubba bubba over dubble bubble you’re crazy
hey the jaw wants what it wants
but what are you looking for
all i’m looking for is an educated intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view she should be kind patient and most important unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight
all right fine she doesn’t need her own point of view now chopchop
come on amy show us the dress
okay but i’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here
uh i don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing
yeah it’s your third date maybe you could go more sexy
well some people think the sexiest organ is the brain
no one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt
do you have any heels higher than this he’s pretty tall
ooh tall finally some details about this mystery man
yeah come on tell us more
well i told you his name and that he’s tall what more do you need
just a little peck on the lips
well we’re your best friends give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone
fine um he’s british all right that is a juicy one
all right where is tall british dave taking you
to that new italian place on walnut
i’m gonna go look for other shoes
good luck i threw out all my tall ones when i married leonard
hey you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy
we don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there
i’ll just call the restaurant pretend i’m amy and check the reservation
yeah but i’m little so it’s adorable
i think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating web site out there
are you sure i’ve heard that on those sites often when you think you’re corresponding with someone it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person
and you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you
excuse me no one does a better job pretending to be a person than i do siri comes close but i know more jokes
if you don’t want to use dating web sites what do you suggest
off the top of my head uh prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory and then sits quietly by my side while i watch daredevil
you seriously think women would fight for you
people compete for jobs and trophies why not me
he’s right he knows a lot of jokes
yeah no but it is basic human nature if we present him as a prize maybe they would
well he’s smart he’s a respected scientist
and i have the soulful eyes of a cow
i don’t know if i’d say you… oh
i have an idea what if we put a post on craigslist that says worldclass caltech physicist seeking girlfriend if interested solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him
oh we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates
oh we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner sheldon’s contact information
well this is actually an interesting social experiment
i’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it
me too and we’ve seen the prize
i don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie
oh i forgot to tell you we’re gonna meet up with bernadette to spy on amy and her date
what i don’t want to do that
what and you think i want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling
this is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see
no it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see
so you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy
you’re not curious who she’s out with
but you’re curious about aluminium cans you’re a weird little guy
that’s it the sheldon cooper girlfriend challenge is officially live
right now somewhere a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use
then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from mordor to the shire
and taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter love and best of all rules
i i hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard
well if she can solve them it’ll prove she’s intelligent tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a saturday night
golly she sounds too good to be true
well i’m having a good time too if you don’t mind me asking why did you and your wife split up
oh you know how it is we wanted different things i wanted children and she wanted a pastry chef named jeanphilippe
no it’s it’s fine it’s why i left england it reminded me too much of her cold gloomy and easily accessed by a frenchman through a tunnel
across the street in the left window
oh damn it we should have brought binoculars
you just happen to have those in the car
kinda before i met howie i liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends
no stalkers are creepy i’m just a harmless little girl with militarygrade spy equipment
what now you’re interested you didn’t even want to come
i know but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun
yeah okay i see him it looks like they’re having a nice time i wish i could hear what they’re saying
yeah i should’ve brought my parabolic microphone
no i mean to be completely honest i’ve i’ve only been in one longterm relationship
that’s a good question after five years it was just feeling like more work than it should be
oh that’s too bad was he a neurobiologist like you
no he’s a theoretical physicist at caltech
i love teaching math but that would be my dream job what’s his focus
um used to be string theory now it’s dark matter but let’s not discuss sheldon let’s get back to you
wait you’re not talking about dr sheldon cooper
i’m trying not to do you know him
no but i’ve followed his work for years he’s a rock star you’ve got to tell me about him what’s he like
i took a video i forgot how much fun this is
okay we saw them can we go catch the movie
i had to we’re married now
i’m sorry just one more question about sheldon
it’s more of a fourpart question really when he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers how long did it take
um about an hour and half
wow i mean wow and you were there to see it
yes yep we were on a date very much like this one
mm i doubt it was like this one i mean he’s a genius and i wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants
what was the rest of your question
do you think you could introduce me to him
really youyou want me to introduce you to my exboyfriend
you’re right it’s it’s weird no wait do it no i changed my mind i’d be too nervous oh i don’t know what to do
are we gonna be much longer i really have to go to the bathroom
37 minutes left until the deadline
and no matter what happens this is still a fun experiment
not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave we really have led full lives
maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you you know what they say opposites attract
well by that logic i should be with someone short dull and needy eh not to cast aspersions but i can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that
you know i once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at stanford
i have a dvd of that lecture
not as a valentine’s present no
well the next time you watch it i’m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious it was the nicest thing he said to anyone there
that’s um terrific listen i’m i’m kind of tired can we call it a night
oh gosh sorry i’ve just spent the whole night talking about your exboyfriend i’m such an idiot
well maybe not an idiot but certainly not as smart as someone we won’t mention
that you said you might introduce me to i’m free on thursday
what here give me give me oh my god oh my god they’re coming right towards us
we got to get out of here
okay well wait what about leonard
he and his tiny bladder can take the bus reverses into car behind
what are you guys doing here
hi ames what are you doing here
i saw you speak at stanford with sheldon cooper amy can you believe it it’s dr leonard hofstadter
it’s an absolute pleasure to meet you can i shake your hand
i don’t know if you want to do that i was just okay never mind
amy i’m never washing this hand again
sixty seconds this is not looking good
one minute is a long time
i’ve been telling women that for 20 years
45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me you know probably half that if i break out the old cow eyes
uhoh what if it’s jennifer lawrence
well that last hunger games was not my cup of tea
you thought she was great in xmen
oh fine i won’t shut my heart to the love of jennifer lawrence
maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment
sounds like a drama queen oh no it is jennifer lawrence
five four three two one that’s too bad
maybe we did make the test too difficult
i don’t think it matters look sheldon i believe when the time is right for you to meet someone it’ll just happen okay not because of a test or a web site but because… knock on door we are the dreamers of dreams
it’s an actual girl and she’s really pretty
all right can i help you
um are you the physicist that placed the ad on craigslist
hi i’m vanessa bennett sorry it took a while for me to get here i was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when i came across your ad and it saved my night the puzzles were were really fun i’ve never had to translate klingon into ancient sanskrit before
and just like that you’re a klingonsanskrit junkie
i am a bit of a unicorn well you certainly seem like a special lady uh but as you know you missed the deadline so thanks for playing
how could you send her away
she was late and she found atomic spectroscopy boring well i wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals
uh thanks for driving me home
no problem i’m really sorry about your car
oh it’s all right if you’re free next weekend i’d love to take you out again
um listen you’re a really nice guy but i just i don’t think this is working out
no it’s at least the same woman that rejected sheldon cooper rejected me
if i ever do meet him we’ll have that in common
and he’s kissed you and i’ve kissed you so if you think about it…
have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to siri without pressing any buttons
you just say uh hey siri what time is it
so now anyone can control your phone hey siri show me pictures of naked grandma butts
nice try it only recognizes my voice
oh cool in thick indian accent hey siri show me pictures of naked grandma butts
here are some images of naked grandma butts
hey good news everybody now that i’m no longer with amy i have an extra ticket to the annual thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria who wants it well you realize you won’t be going alone i’ll be there the whole time providing fish and pilgrim facts can you people hear me
yeah leonard and i are gonna be cooking all day
and raj and i are volunteering at the soup kitchen feeding food to the homeless
oh i can’t i’m going to the soup kitchen too
you said that sounded like the worst thing ever
if you can’t support me when i’m lying why are we married
well i’m calling because thanksgiving is coming up and i wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets
no one can go with you
no they’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year i finally touch a starfish anyway i wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste so take whomever you’d like
and feel free to tell your guest that the myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish in case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy
sheldon i can tell you want to go so if you’d be comfortable with it maybe we could go as friends
you don’t think that will be awkward
well it is thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria so i’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes but if you mean between us i think it’ll be fine
very well then i’ll see you on thanksgiving morning
oh and forget what i said about the myanmar catfish my list of marinethemed pilgrim facts is pretty short
did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first thanksgiving
the soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs and the shifts are six hours
six hours oh god i don’t want to complain for that long
do you ever do anything for anyone else
i happen to be a giving and generous lover
are you and i close enough for me to say that’s creepy
we are and i believe the word you’re looking for is yuhuhhuhhuh
oh i appreciate you guys coming down but we already have enough people any other day please come back
oh okay wipe that smug smile off your face
maybe i’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate
are you and i close enough for me to say…
that he’s an ass he beat you to it
i was wrong a large group had to cancel
oh great we’d love to help
wipe that smug smile off your face
look at us our first thanksgiving as husband and wife
i know i feel so grown up
really how many grownups do you know who have mr spock oven mitts hey the recipes are on my ipad will you pull ’em up
it’s just the four digits month and day
let me see yeah there what number were you putting in
you don’t know my birthday do you
i’m not gonna say your password out loud that is not secure
you don’t know your own husband’s birthday
well you don’t know everything about me
your birthday is december 2 you grew up on perkins street the last four digits of your social are 7 62 1 and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero
oh look at us our last thanksgiving as husband and wife
i am you know and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends i printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation
if that makes you more comfortable
if there were a list of things that make me more comfortable lists would be on the top of that list okay now oh since last we spoke have you acquired any pets
no um since last we spoke have you planned or gone on any vacations
i might go visit my aunt next week
bakersfield i see where has this list been all my life
we’re gonna have you washing dishes uh aprons and rubber gloves are here just scrape wash and stack if you need me i’ll be around
so we don’t even get to be up front where the action is
i don’t know i was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say please sir i want some more
you’re in a soup kitchen not a production of oliver
it’s not like i’m expecting them to sing
and then the next day was 73 degrees and the day after that was 72 and then it was 72 again uh then it was 74 and that brings us to today at i’d wear shorts if i had a pair 78
are we done discussing the weather
i don’t know if i’d call it discussing you kind of sat back and let me do all the work let’s see what’s next on the list oh uh do you whittle and if so what kind of knife do you use
sheldon we’ve known each other a long time we are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the internet
all right well what should we talk about
i don’t know just ask me whatever comes to mind
very well i know you’ve been seeing other men have you had coitus with any of them
man i walked right into that one
next we need a teaspoon of pepper which i believe was also the name of your childhood dog
fine you think you know so much who’s my favourite spice girl
who’s my favorite member of nsync
face it you can’t stump me i am the king of husbands i know that you don’t like the lingerie that i got you on valentine’s day i know you hate the word moist i know…
hang on wait wait why don’t i like the lingerie you got me
because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot
interesting i never told you that
no i never told anyone that but i did write it in my journal
what i didn’t know you had a journal
i also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying
you know this reminds me of high school
no i was in india it was humid and smelled funny
all right i think i’m getting into a groove here this isn’t so bad
we’ve only been doing this 20 minutes
you know i read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation the key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes
just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid
no seriously it’s about being present in the moment focusing on the feeling of the warm water the smell of the detergent the sound of the dishes squeaking and following your own breath it’s about it’s about simply being
i need three people out front
come on don’t be mad it was a long time ago and it was an accident
how can reading my journal be an accident
i didn’t even know what it was i saw it on your nightstand i picked it up
well when you realized what it was why didn’t you stop
you know me i’m a big ol’ bookworm
all right let’s just finish cooking
well hey okay let me make this up to you sometimes i keep an online journal i want you to read something that i wrote
okay well then i’ll read it to you it’s from the day we first met beauty thy name is penny
oh god stop i don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up i want to hear the most recent thing you wrote
fine mmm penny’s beauty like our love grows more with each passing day”
omg omg we’re so close to the new star wars i can’t take it gah gah
well you didn’t read it right the new star wars is coming gah
i’m sensing things have gotten awkward
no it’s okay if we’re friends we should be able to talk about anything
so you had some questions about me seeing other people
how many dates have you been on who were they with where’d you go where did you meet them did you sleep with them and how much longer to the aquarium i’m getting kind of hungry
let’s see i have been on six dates with three different people it was either for coffee or dinner one i met at a bookstore and two i met online i haven’t slept with anyone the aquarium is 40 minutes away and there’s a baggie of cheerios for you in the glove compartment
is that regular or honey nut
you mixed them no wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door do you have any questions for me
just one are you doing okay
good i want you to be happy
i believe you i’d believe you more if you threw a few apple jacks in here
thanks you got to be kidding me
wh what are you doing here
i’m washing dishes well i was on the turkey line but i got demoted for being too generous with the gravy
oh man i what an honour to meet you i’m i’m such a fan of tesla and spacex all your companies howard wolowitz caltech
nice to meet you howard feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate huh
oh yeah nothing better than helping people which is something i realized when i was viewing earth from the deck of the international space station where i spent two months as a payload specialist a job i was qualified for because i’m an mittrained engineer
and i thought i ladled the gravy on thick
sorry it’s just you’re you you know and i really want you to adopt me
well you’re here on thanksgiving so you’re probably a good person
oh i made my wife come down too
you think you might ever get back out to space
is that a job offer ‘cause i really want to go to mars assuming i can bring my wife she hardly takes up any room she’s basically a carryon
well we’re not quite there yet but we’re always looking for engineers so let me give you my email we can stay in touch
oh look someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie want to share it with me
a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter with elon musk you bet i do
you know for a thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria that was really bad
you’re just upset ’cause they ran out of pilgrim hats
they gave one to that baby he wasn’t even awake
well it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby
oh would you care to play an oceanthemed game i invented
it’s called food friend fight one of us chooses three aquatic creatures and the other one must decide which he would eat befriend or battle
so it’s like kiss marry kill
it’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss marry or kill
well my game is better ’cause instead of marrying someone you get to eat them
i’ll start you off easy electric eel pufferfish shrimp
hmm well i wouldn’t fight the eel because i know it can generate enough current to kill a horse so i’d eat the eel fight the shrimp and befriend the pufferfish because it would be nice to have company on those days i feel bloated
thank you okay your turn hmm seal hagfish spongebob squarepants
well i’d befriend spongebob but he’s not real so i can’t do that can i
but you can pal around with a hagfish
hey let’s not pull at that thread okay i’ll fight spongebob because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other um i’ll befriend the seal because he’s trainable which is the problem i’m having with my current friends which means i’ll have to eat the hagfish
isn’t that gross i mean a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute
i know it makes its own gravy it’ll slide right down
how can you miss a game you’ve never played before silly
hey where’d you go i can’t tell if the turkey’s done
i’m sorry about the journal i want to make it up to you so i’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on facebook
i am not putting that on the internet i don’t want people to see this i don’t want to see it
don’t want people to see what huh a little bit of this
huh some of this and since it’s thanksgiving an extra helping of this
i’m glad you had a nice time with amy
me too it’s comforting to know that she and i are able to function as friends
well i’ve never been friends with any of my exes
oh i’m sure you and leonard will be able to pull it off phone rings oh it’s my friend amy hello
hi sheldon i’m just driving home from my mother’s
did you have a nice time
i did um listen i really enjoyed spending this morning with you
well i can’t take all the credit it was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way
it was uh listen i i was thinking that um maybe i’m ready to be your girlfriend again
oh i thought we were just friends
we are but i was hoping maybe…
amy i excel at many things but getting over you wasn’t one of them i think i need to just be your friend
good oh i watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus so i’m gonna change my answer and eat spongebob
sheldon cooper’s descent into madness day two it’s 2
since when do you hum songs
are you sure sometimes when my brain really gets moving it makes noise
how does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls
let’s see hey i was humming one point for hufflepuff what song is that
well hum it again is that the spongebob song
who lives in a pineapple nope
whatever can we just get back to this
i feel like i know what song that is but i can’t put my finger on it singing my country ’tis of thee no
it’s just an earworm it’ll come to you
is this what we’re doing the rest of the night
i’m surprised you have to ask
hello yes i was hoping you could help me what song is this la la la la la la la you don’t know well how dare you call yourselves a rock and roll hall of fame my goodness do you sing along to the greatest hits of elvis presley with that mouth well they were no help at all
which is crazy since rock and roll is all about good customer service
yeah so you have a song stuck in your head it happens to everybody
well i’m not everybody i have an eidetic memory i should be able to remember what song this is but i can’t something’s wrong with me
i told you if we were patient he’d figure it out for himself
i was always afraid this day would come this might be the first step of my descent into madness where i gradually test the limits of public nudity
eh that just means going barefoot
terrific and pleasantly surprised to hear from you given how i acted on our last date
yeah well we both made mistakes you know i took the last breadstick you gushed over my exboyfriend like he was leonard nimoy and you were my exboyfriend
so to what do i owe the pleasure
well i was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime
let me just check my schedule he said trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule
uh hmm let me see uh friday farmers’ market with jay z sunday piano shopping with elton john saturday works
oh did you know at the united nations there’s a department for outer space affairs
they exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization
mm boy that’s one of those jobs that’s boring boring boring then oh god where’s the memo with what we do now
oh this is cool so a few weeks ago i set up a fan page on facebook for our band and…
wait a second how could you do that without consulting me
it’s not a big deal it just took like five minutes to set up
that’s not the point when we created footprints on the moon we agreed that every band decision would be mutual now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing you know maybe i should go solo
but someone joined our page we have an actual fan
all right this thing’s bigger than you and me band’s back together
so listen to what he wrote uh i saw you play at the comic book store you guys rock and then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this
we did raise the roof that night
why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great
why can’t i recall this song this is taking far too long the urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong
no they make my earlobes sweat
hey sweetie why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while
there was a project i’ve been thinking about starting
i’ll show you into phone camera dear crazy future sheldon you were driven mad by an earworm your mind once your most trusted asset is now a sack of parrots and monkeys so i’m going to tell you everything you need to know uh first music is dangerous the movie footloose tried to warn us but we wouldn’t listen oh wait singing everyody cut footloose nope
i’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose
this is penny she is your friend if she offers you food it’s safe to take it you probably paid for it anyway
so you’re really going out with dave again
why not he’s actually a very nice guy
but he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves sheldon
that’s nothing sheldon hasn’t done before dave’s just a big fan of his work besides he said he wouldn’t bring it up again
okay so where’s he taking you
oh he’s coming here i’m actually making dinner
yeah you’re inviting him into your home it’s intimate it’s where your underpants live
you know what good i tried to get back together with sheldon he shot me down dave likes me maybe intimate is what i need
you sure you’ve never really been with a man do you really want to start with one that’s sixfootseven
‘cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus
maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him
how about uh oh how about we might be footprints on the moon but your kind words sent us over the moon
someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma
well what do you want to write
something badass you know like thanks for diggin’ our vibe we’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’
dude if i was wearing a bra i’d throw it at your head right now
i’ll keep rockin’ you don’t do that
let’s see uh his name is trent monaco
yeah he’s 24 he’s a deejay he brews his own beer he’s got awesome tattoos dude he’s got a hot girlfriend too
damn i don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or i’m his hey trent just liked our comment
he is so cool hey no hard feelings but i’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him
oh my god he won’t stop
how does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying
nobody knows that’s why he’s number one can you please go talk to him
come on i take care of him all day long you do it for once
once who got the gum out of his hair
what do you want a medal it was your gum
what are you doing in my room stop it that’s mine why are you so strong
oh yeah he got a tuba
dear crazy future sheldon this is a thermostat it controls the temperature of the apartment the ideal setting is 72 degrees if you find this too cold then put on a jacket a straitjacket ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy now this is your spot you’re very protective of it when anyone else tries to sit here you berate them relentlessly it sounds mean but somehow you make it adorable people are also delighted by your love of pranks for example leonard has no idea what i did to his coffee it wasn’t replace it with folger’s crystals i’ll tell you that much
hey can we please get back to work
this is leonard he’s your best friend in the world
all right just stop this is ridiculous
sometimes he gets cranky but you can trust him with your life and he does more things for you than i can even begin to list
look at this trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle
that is so cool old broken things are so much better than new things that work
uh did you forget we’re in a band
you mean because you played one time in the comic book store
and at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave
hey dude trent just checked in at the coffee shop on fair oaks
really you want to go down there and meet him
are you stalking him that’s creepy
it’s not creepy i built a footprints on the moon fan page trent joined it
after that all i did was check out his profile go back in the archive of his feed until i found his twitter handle
from there it was easy to find him on instagram snapchat and pretty much track his every movement
so if you think that’s creepy you married the wrong guy
yeah like she could get trent
been a long time since i had a homecooked meal
when you were married did your wife cook
not at first no but when she began cheating on me with a french chef she became quite the wiz in the kitchen
i suppose yeah nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properlyseasoned bowl of onion soup how long have you uh lived here
uh about five years i’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that i don’t need to be so close to well you know
i do the brilliant physicist that i now know lives in the area not that i care
yeah anyway he doesn’t drive so i pretty much had to take him everywhere
had to or got to sorry
my fault i brought him up
yeah well let’s change the subject no more mentions of youknowwho that’s a cool train where did you get that
bah bam bumbum bah bum bum this song is never going to stop have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating
well i shouldn’t be surprised there’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness
come on sheldon there are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems
yup she’s right for every newton who had a psychological issue there’s an edison who was just a jerk that could totally be you
empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano and pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back
maybe he just had bread in his pocket
the list extends outside of science painters like van gogh and pollock chess champion bobby fischer brian wilson of the beach boys clip of darling by the beach boys i remember the song it’s called darlin’ by the beach boys oh thank goodness i’m not crazy i don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride
there goes our shot at him living on the roof
so all right there he is so should we introduce ourselves
i wonder if he’s listening to our music right now
could you imagine what a cool way for us to meet he’s playing our song and looks up and there we are his favorite twopiece acoustic scifi novelty rock band
and he’s all like aren’t you the guys from footprints on the mooooooh what is he doing
it’s okay oh it’s okay he’s done
why is he looking at it
eh no he’s not going to eat it is he
come on trent you’re better than thah
i wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head
i don’t know it’s pretty catchy
do you even like the beach boys
they have beach right in the name what do you think
well now that you can focus again what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls
of course i’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… i know why the song was in my head
okay look i know amy’s like an old lady but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her
it’s about how she made my life better consider the lyrics i was living like half a man then i couldn’t love but now i can more soul than i ever had i love the way you soften my life”
she did soften your life didn’t she
yes she’s like the dryer sheets of my heart i have to go
aw am i like the dryer sheets of your heart
better you’re the lint trap of my love
oh thanks it’s uh avogadro’s constant it’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance or causing regret in anyone who asks about it
no i i think it’s neat oh
sorry sorry no one’s ever liked the tie clip before so i just lost all control
no it it’s okay and we are on a date i’m i’m just a little nervous
well no need to be nervous with me i’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land
you know i’m just being silly i i don’t know what i’m waiting for
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
sheldon this this isn’t a good time
i don’t care amy there was a song i couldn’t get out of my head eventually i realized the song was about you and like that earworm i can’t get you out of my heart so what i’m trying to say is you’re my heartworm the metaphorical kind not not the poodlekilling kind
if i may i believe what he’s saying in a charming and delightful way is that he loves you and wants you back dave gibbs huge fan of your work don’t mind me
i’m i’m sorry i didn’t realize you were on a date
no it it it’s okay keep going
amy if you want to be my girlfriend again i really want to be your boyfriend
well i’ll let you get back to your date
okay then i’ll uh see myself out amy thank you for dinner dr cooper pleasure to meet you sir uh if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment i’d uh love to discuss physics or shoot the breeze as you yanks say ah what a lovely evening
guys tickets already went on sale
they’re not supposed to be available yet
i don’t know what to tell you but they’re on sale
wait you’re sure they’re star wars tickets
the web site’s frozen i can’t get in
all right this goes against everything i stand for but desperate times call for desperate measures lord this is sheldon cooper you’re good friends with my mom i know i’ve spent my life denying that you exist
and i will continue to do so
i’m really happy you and amy are back together
i’m also really happy but i can’t pretend it’s for you new star wars in three days
hey thursday can’t get here soon enough i’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while i eat enough star wars cereal to choke a wookiee
uh sweetie you do realize thursday is amy’s birthday
and you do realize i bought my ticket when amy and i were broken up i hope you didn’t need anything in that case ’cause it’s closed
you guys just got back together you might not want to ditch her on her birthday
i think penny has a point you can see it another day
but someone might spoil the movie no one can spoil amy’s birthday for me surprise she’s even older who saw that coming
aw that’s nice put that on her cake
uh beats me i i just hope this isn’t a a sex dream
in the past you’ve come to me when i’m struggling with a dilemma
and and the one time where where you were afraid and you needed me for for a night light what’s what’s troubling you
well my friends are telling me i shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new star wars movie
well sounds right can can i get out of this muumuu now
those are the robes of the jedi the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy
and they they they don’t wear underwear
so you agree with my friends that i should skip the premiere
uh do do you love this girl
yes but she knows how important star wars is to me
well maybe you should show her how how important she is to you
by seeing the movie she’d want me to see
sheldon you you can see this movie whenever you want but you only have a limited number of days that you you can be with this woman be with her
i don’t know but hopefully somewhere i can wear pants
i wanted to let you know i’ll be spending your birthday with you
see i i had tickets to the star wars premiere that night but professor proton came to me in a dream dressed as obiwan kenobi and convinced me i should be with you
i’ll i’ll let you get back to sleep now good night
okay good night wait um sheldon were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me
it’s late got to go bye
good for sheldon deciding to stay with amy on her birthday
i know it’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him
well we could wait a couple days and see it together all laugh
hey we’re going to the comic book store you want to come
no i can’t i need to make preparations for amy’s birthday which leads me to the following bit of business this is my ticket to star wars i don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents i trust you’ll give it to someone worthy
you got it well penny might want to join us
this is my ticket to star wars…
knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny
what happens if i say come in
knock knock knock bernadette knock knock knock bernadette knock knock knock bernadette
keep it up i got nowhere else to be
for future reference if i want to watch mean girls i’ll stream it on netflix
we’re sorry what do you need
well as you know i’ll be celebrating amy’s birthday with her and i could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift
well so far i’ve come up with three ideas the first is a chance for her to play the harp with the la philharmonic
wow you can really arrange that
well i said a chance you know when you tell them it’s your birthday at bennigan’s they make a fuss i don’t see why the philharmonic would be any different
how about something a little more realistic
well amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters so i was thinking of getting her an allexpensepaid trip to the wisconsin sheep and wool festival
sorry i was waiting for the bazinga
hold on it could be romantic the two of them away together keeping each other warm in snowy wisconsin
no no no no she’d be going alone well if you think i’m afraid of birds you should see me around sheep
okay well what’s the third option
that i have coitus with her
what do you think about giving sheldon’s ticket to stuart
i don’t know have you ever seen a movie with stuart before
it’s like going with your grandpa instead of eating popcorn he brings little pieces of chicken in tupperware and a thermos full of soup
he’s not that bad hey stuart got any plans thursday night
my uh my doctor’s worried about my circulation so i was thinking about walking around the mall why
oh make sure to wear sensible shoes wil want to go to star wars thursday
fine take wil see if he brings you clam chowder
okay okay okay okay okay let’s let’s let’s just recap our options all right we’ve got harp thing sheep thing
which do you think she’d prefer because i checked the sheep and wool festival web site and there’s only 8000 tickets left
sheldon being physical with amy is a huge step for you
yeah are you ready for this
intimacy in any form has been challenging for me but i’d like to show her how important she is and it feels like now might be the right time
then it’s settled amy’s birthday present will be my genitals
well you’re spending your birthday with sheldon why not celebrate early
so where do you want to go
i heard that new mexican place on green street is good
sure sure or we could take you to get a bikini wax
why would i get a bikini wax for my birthday
uh i don’t know it was just a thought
i think i’ll just stick to mexican
great and then maybe after we can watch a dirty movie and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how we can answer them
oh we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow
we don’t want to spoil anything but you should know that sheldon said he’s ready to be physical
you shut your damn mouth you actually heard him say this
yes he said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him
i i can’t believe it i i don’t know what to say
well we’re really happy for you and we know how much he cares…
i do know what to say let’s get me waxed
why isn’t it ever angie dickinson’s bedroom
it it doesn’t seem like it’s up to me
i suppose you’re here because i’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend and i’ve never done that before
eh excuse me for a moment well it was worth a shot
uh all right um once once the man gets the the woman out of her out of her bloomers…
oh no not that i i understand the mechanics
oh good good ‘cause uh i have no idea what kids these days are calling their their parts
what is happening to this world what what do you actually need to know
this is an important night for us and i’m worried i might be overwhelmed and ruin everything
sheldon if if you’re with the right person it it’ll be okay
thank you arthur you are the wisest of the wise
well that’s that’s very nice of you to say but i think i’m just an expression of of your unconscious mind
oh sure well you’re fun to look at
yeah the wait is finally over
i know then you’ll finally stop talking about it
i can’t believe sheldon gave this up
we’re gonna have so much more fun than him
oh did you hear from wil
yeah he’s on his way time for bladder check
check wait screw it i’m holding it
um hey wil what you doin’
i was on star trek just rooting for the home team
yeah live long and suck it
knock knock knock birthday girl knock knock knock birthday girl knock knock knock birthday girl
hello sorry i’m late i also got you a balloon but it floated away and i chased it for a while
that’s okay come on in thank you um i’ll i’m gonna go put these in water
okay ooh this is different hmm candles and music
no no no it’s your birthday as long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask i’ll be fine
so what’d you have in mind for tonight
i thought i could take you out to a nice birthday dinner if we pick a place east of here we might find the balloon
um that sounds nice but i’m not really hungry right now i thought maybe we could do presents first
oh all right um i should probably tell you something about this gift
you mean before you give it to me
yes may i ask you a question before i give it to you
why are we saying give it to you like that
sheldon i know your present is for us to be intimate tonight
i see is that all right i’m sorry but this is a litigious society i’m gonna need verbal consent
you know what let me pull a quick contract off the internet
so if you don’t like star wars why are you here
oh i’m just having fun everyone takes star wars so seriously like if the movie’s bad it’s gonna ruin their lives
is it bad did you hear something oh my god it’s bad somebody kill me
see that’s what i mean when you wake up in the morning whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap your life isn’t gonna change at all
yeah no matter what happens we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again
do you think sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it
i don’t know he said he’s ready
yeah but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin
well i’m gonna stay positive i mean we talked i told him what women like and after he stopped giggling he seemed pretty sure of himself
so um should i get under the covers with you
why are you shaking are you cold
well i’ve been waiting for this for so long i’ve just built it up in my head i don’t know what to expect
neither do i but we can find out together
i know we’ve been waiting so long for this
and we’ve built it up in our heads so much
although we all remember jar jar
well i enjoyed that more than i thought i would
i look forward to your next birthday when we do it again
i enjoyed that more than i thought i would
i don’t think i can walk right now
arthur what are you doing here i i don’t think i need any more advice
i i was just curious how how’d it go
oh it was amazing i i saw it a few days later what a movie
but uh what what about amy
oh uh uh she liked it fine but she doesn’t have the history with the franchise i do
i’m glad to see you made it safely how’s your hotel
it’s not the best best western i’ve been to but i’d say it’s the third best best western i’ve been to
i know how you feel the best buy by my house is only the third best best buy they have the best buys but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a best buy the best best buy
what makes a best best buy the best best buy
mm that’s a great question i like when they’re next to a chipotle
all right enjoy the neurobiology conference
i will i wish you were here
at a neurobiology conference what a mean thing to say
okay i’m glad you’re not here
aw you always know just what to say after i tell you what to say
bye oh good news gentlemen amy’s at a conference this weekend which means i’m available to be entertained hmm as today’s youth might put it who wants to get their sheldon
bernie and i are getting the house ready for the remodel we could always use an extra pair of hands
uh i’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets you’re more than welcome to join me
that’s the one to beat leonard
oh if anything i’m trying to get my sheldoff
well then it looks like we have a winner congratulations
well i should warn you it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen
uh stop selling it kid you won
oh not good still couldn’t get in to see dr gallo
a doctor well i hope you’re not contagious i’ve got a weekend in the telescope room i’ve been excited about for almost three minutes
i’m not sick it’s for work there’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps i’ve been trying to get in for months
well did you try wearing the shirt i said was inappropriate for work
well the doctor’s a woman but yes because you never know
what kind of doctor is she
well what if you make an appointment as a patient then you’ll get to talk to her
yeah they already know i’m a pharmaceutical sales rep
oh what if leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you
i’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist what would i say is wrong with me
uh denial see sweetie the list goes on and on
that’s just crazy how would my going in there even help you
i don’t know you could talk to her and maybe if it comes up you could ask if she’s heard about the drug
fine i’ll do it but not because of them because i love you
still hasn’t bought milk even though i told him two days ago
it was i just wish stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet
i know it’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his japanese porn cartoons
you guys got a minute or are you still cuddling
hang on should i send him away
uh well i know the remodel is coming up so i thought i’d make it easy on you guys and find my own place
wow i thought i was done getting lucky tonight
so when are you thinking of moving
uh actually i already found an apartment so in a couple of days
oh okay sorry to see you go
okay well thank you guys for everything i i really appreciate it
hmm i just have never been in this room while you’re awake
uh making sure the telescope’s camera is whitefield balanced
hmm what are you doing now
still making sure the telescope’s camera is whitefield balanced
oh i see how about now
now i’m making sure the telescope’s camera is whitefield balanced and wishing you had a colouring book
well i can be helpful give me something to do you know my father took me to work once and in ten minutes i figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register it was my father yeah dad lost his job but mr hinckley gave me a fudgsicle
fine you want something to do there’s about six months of data on this hard drive why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies
yep i’m on it hey look at that an indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella
yeah okay whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours
no you didn’t there are millions of data points there
yeah maybe that is something how did you find that
it wasn’t difficult you know how when you see prime numbers they appear red but when they’re twin primes they’re pink and smell like gasoline
oh i guess i’m a special boy you know sometimes when a boy is special he gets a fudgsicle which by the way tastes like the speed of light
thank you for seeing me on such short notice
ah it’s my pleasure i’m curious are you related to dr beverly hofstadter
uh she’s my mother you know her
no not personally but i have read all of her books
well then you know her better than i do
well i’m not so sure about that but i can tell you i do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all
really any chance you find them cold cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy
well i didn’t want to say it
no no say it sing it rent a plane write it in the sky
sounds like you’re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her
oh no i i’ve worked through a lot of that stuff i’m better now
do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement not mine
right to this day i send her a card every year with a little money in it
you know once we get the house back to ourselves we can be romantic in any room we want
great i can finally show you where the laundry room is
boy who would’ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom i’d still be here two years later
yeah a grown man moving into his own apartment crazy times see ya
ignore him he’s just using humour to express how happy he is
it’s okay i know he loves me
sure he does well let us know when you’re all settled in
i will and i really can’t thank you guys enough
he’s gone let’s start in the garage
okay so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected we’ll know what it is that we found
ooh perhaps it’s a heliosheath scintillation
it could be a transneptunian object
unlikely but it could be a dwarf planet
well as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons i’ll be happy
okay the final image is coming in and the object we discovered is…
come on daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist
that’s it how common that’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space
i kind of like chicken fingers
yeah me too i was stuck for a metaphor
come on a mediumsized asteroid is still an interesting discovery
i suppose it could end up on a collision course with earth and destroy life as we know it
yeah it is and you know we get to name it
we better choose a name no one can make fun of sir frederick william herschel didn’t do uranus any favours
oh great dr gallo is terrific you know i i’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what i have to say but she made me see…
yeah no one cares did you help me out or not
okay now what i’m hearing is that you feel that i sometimes take too long to express myself and you wish i’d be more succinct
you’re only hearing that because i cannot roll my eyes any louder
all right well after we talked about my issues with my mother nothing too deep just how she ruined my life i told her about you and your drug she said she’d be happy to meet you
really oh you’re the best husband ever
so you’ll go to the doctor who convention with me next week
oh i actually did hear your eyes roll that time
boy when was the last time stuart cleaned this place
no kidding oh okay i’m about to suck something up what do you think this object sounds like
howie i don’t want to play lego toenail or pill anymore so what do you think we should do with this room
well i was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room you know like a man cave
why can’t it be a woman cave
as long as it has a home theatre a video game system and you’re not allowed in it you can call it whatever you want
well what do you think we should do
i don’t know maybe a home office or oh look the teddy bear stuart won the night we took him to the fair
yeah you know no matter how hard they tried they could not guess his age
i’ll give it to him next time i see him
have you heard from him since he left
no you’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in
too busy to call he wasn’t too busy to bingewatch hot in cleveland with my hulu password what is happening are we missing him
no that’s not what this feeling is is it
of course not he drove us crazy like when you were gonna make that pie and stuart ate all the blueberries
and he tried to deny it but his teeth were all purple
yeah ew we are missing him
so i was thinking maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names
that’s a great idea i’ve got it we’ll call it cooper
how is that both our names
koo from koothrappali and per from cooper
yeah sso it’s like kooper with a k
oh leonard great news we discovered a mediumsized asteroid together
wow that’s amazing i’m in a pretty great mood today myself
okay guess we’re gonna talk about you now
well we are because dr gallo made me realize that i’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter
i learned that for free from a cat poster but good for you
okay back to me i discovered an asteroid and now i get to name it
now this isn’t about us this is about what’s best for the asteroid
well what are you thinking of naming it
i haven’t settled on anything yet
we haven’t settled on anything yet
all right way to go cat poster you hang in there
you know what’d be nice name it after your girlfriends show them how much you care
it’s perfect it appears romantic but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of valentine’s day forever
so uh what were you thinking combine their names
i like it yeah we’ll take the am from amy and uh the y from emily
exactly see how well we work together
and in doubleblind studies placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety actually funny story the boys in the lab were worried about getting fda approval for placinex they started taking it stopped worrying
uh do you have any questions
when you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me what were you thinking there
i just meant a question about the drug
yeah i know what you meant let’s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married leonard
here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years do you think he’s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you
you know i used to wear tank tops a lot that was a big selling point
uh please tell me what to say next
perhaps i should explain while working with koothrappali we discovered an asteroid and i named it after you
oh sheldon thank you that’s so romantic but what about rajesh he was okay with you choosing the name
well it took a little negotiating but i wore him down uh we get the asteroid and if you and i have children they all have to be named rajesh
okay i think i know what to say now
how can i not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with star wars toys i mean have you ever had sex with a stuffed wookiee watching you
i went to college in the ’70s it was a hairier time i’m gonna say yes
you know if anything he’s turning me into his mother before i did pharmaceutical sales i was an actress you know i was pretty good you know girlnextdoor type but hot doable
and not only am i leonard’s mother but we have this manchild living with us named sheldon
oh leonard talked a lot about him i wasn’t sure if he was real
yeah he’s as real as the fine i get when i use too much toilet paper
wow you really do have a lot on your plate
i do you know leonard’s right talking to you is really helping
oh i’m glad you know you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety
okay if you think it’ll help oh just don’t make it placinex i do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage
i can’t believe i miss stuart
i guess i just miss when life was simpler
go leonard go leonard go leonard go leonard
remember girls you decide what makes you happy not your emotionally withholding mothers
go leonard go leonard go leonard go leonard go leonard
hey so i saw a movie trailer the other day how could batman possibly fight superman i mean isn’t that dumb
well batman’s got a lot of money maybe he builds a suit that can do everything superman can do
no no no no no i’ve seen that movie it’s called iron man
and now ben affleck is batman
oh he was great in shakespeare in love
ooh we should watch that next girls’ night
we could do a double feature with the leonardo di caprio romeo and juliet
oh i love me some leo
oh hello everyone i am happy to report i’m feeling much better
my fever is gone my sinuses are pressurefree and my mucus is as clear as a yosemite waterfall
i’ll be able to return to work tomorrow
well why isn’t everyone happy your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again
no but i knew that his yay was sarcastic not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof
penny rub vicks on my chest
sheldon i cooked you breakfast i made your bed i checked your mouth for thrush you can rub your own chest
oh sure grope every other male on the planet but draw the line with me
i brought you a little care package from work it’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make
i hope laughter is the best medicine ’cause this care package is a joke
hey she came all the way here…
you’re gonna want to take these with food
sheldon stop being a baby and let emily take a look at you
well in that case try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you
you’re not dying it’s just the flu
i asked for chicken noodle this is chicken and stars it’s killing me
i never did get that chicken noodle did i
physically yes but i’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason
why don’t you tell me what happened and in a gentle loving way i’ll explain to you why you’re wrong
you know how when you’re sick you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter
ooh gentle and loving this is gonna be tricky
i had a hundred and one fever if that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones when is
sheldon when you’re sick you can be unbearable that’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended
you stayed in michigan all week to avoid being around me
no no not just that i mean detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting
you know i’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick when penny got food poisoning she threw up so loudly i could barely hear the television
ooh i just heard something might be hail might be gunfire either way i’m gonna go take pictures bye
no he’s fine we just needed a little break
yeah i get that when i brought him his comics the other day he said oh great death is literally at my door
he was being a jerk to everyone don’t take it personally
oh i’m on so many antidepressants i couldn’t if i wanted to
i wish we could do more stuff without sheldon
i wish that all the time usually before i blow out birthday candles
you know amy took some time off from him really improved their relationship
huh okay as long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him i’m in
we should all take a trip or something
well you know penny and i have been talking about taking a weekend in vegas maybe we should all go
oh ooh maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there
yeah that sounds fun a partybus party don’t stop ooh when i say party you say bus
so the guys and i were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to vegas
oh that could be fun but just to be clear you mean a party bus with booze and music right not like juice boxes and video games
yes and howard’s birthday was a dropoff party you didn’t have to stay
well i’m in when are we going
ugh atlantic city without the taffy no thank you
that’s fine ’cause actually you’re not invited
oh sheldon you don’t even like it there
i can consider a place america’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit
oh fine then i’ll just hang out with wolowitz
well then raj and i will…
our friends are jerks and i’m mad at all of them
i said what’s new but sure
can you believe they planned a trip to las vegas and didn’t invite me
did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad
you know i liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship
everyone tried to take care of you and you were nothing but mean to them
i can’t believe you’re not on my side i was on your side when someone stole your car radio
who else’s side could you have been on
i don’t know a musicloving hobo with a heart of gold
sheldon i understand that you’re upset because you feel left out but i don’t know why we’re even talking about this just apologize to them
fine if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip
maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad it’s called empathy it’s something you could work on
i have empathy watch leonard made me soup and i was mean to him
great now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person
fine leonard made me soup and i was mean to him hey i felt a little something let me try again leonard made me soup and i was mean to him i was mean to him he must have felt terrible oh now i feel terrible neat
now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in detroit longer than you needed to
hey we’re both great at this
leonard get ready for an apology and with the added twist of an m night shyamalan movie i’m going to mean it
ah so like every other m night shyamalan movie i’ve seen you spoil it in advance
hey if you didn’t know bruce willis was dead the whole time that’s not on me okay here it comes you tried to take care of me when i was sick and i was mean to you there’s no excuse for that and i’m truly sorry
i want you to know that that is sincere i do feel bad i’m not just saying it to be included on your trip
terrific now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come me to ask are you sure you to say absolutely and then me to bring it home with how could i say no to that face
what i apologized and i meant it i know that we don’t play this game very often but you’re doing it wrong
sheldon i accept your apology but you upset a lot of people while you were sick i’m not in a position to just say you can come
well all right what if i apologize to all of them
fine if you apologize to everyone they all say it’s okay then yes you can come
challenge accepted sounds like it’s time for the sheldon cooper apology tour
well i hope it’s as much fun as the sheldon cooper spellchecks local menus tour
my goodness do you remember comes with apsparagus
howard and bernadette you tried to comfort me when i was ill and i treated you terribly i’m sorry
no no no wait i’m not done allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of brenda lee’s i’m sorry played on the pan flute
all right that’s eight hours of practice down the drain and to memorialise this occasion here are your commemorative tshirts
and he made it all better
all you did was offer maternal care and affection and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior
i’m afraid it can’t the trip is tomorrow and i have more apologies to make
okay fine i accept your apology now get out
wonderful would you mind holding up this shirt while i take a quick…
you brought me my comic books when i wasn’t feeling well that that was thoughtful and i was insensitive i’m sorry
thank you sheldon i appreciate that
and i want you to know that i mean it you know this isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to las vegas
the one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus
that would be my understanding on a less painful subject what size tshirt do you take
raj you were being a good friend and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour i hope that you can accept my apology
and emily i’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors and i’m sure you’re tired of hearing that
do you honestly think i hear that a lot
well i would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting botox into old lady faces…
okay okay the point is that we accept your apology
uh maybe you do he just insulted me again
yeah but he doesn’t mean it
i believe i can answer that uh like me raj is demonstrating empathy now why don’t you accept my apology receive your free tshirt uh i hope extra small is okay for some reason wolowitz took a medium
well i don’t accept your apology
it’s called standing up for myself you should try it some time
fine how about this you’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight and i wish you’d stop
oh you want me to stop no problem
no come on please don’t leave
point of clarification are you still going on the trip because if not…
i caused that fight i feel terrible wait i can do that better i caused that fight i feel terrible yeah wow i don’t know which one i like more
so was the fight really bad
no as a fight it was excellent she used harsh language and slammed the door although as i say this that might not have been what you were asking
you think they’ll still go on the trip
all i know is after the fight i went to emily’s to smooth…
they’re not going on the trip
look at him caring about what’s wrong with me that is some topshelf empathy hey well we should start a club
you went to emily’s to apologise and when you left she was crying
that is true well i suppose i should apologize again
yeah i calmed her down but she’s not going to vegas if he’s going
wait that’s an option i didn’t know that was an option
well that is fine because i’ve decided that i won’t be joining you i’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse i feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves
well i’ve been on a little trip myself recently not to sin city but to sincere city where instead of genital warts the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth
ooh check out the stripper pole
that raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway
mmhmm well i would like to propose a toast to a welldeserved weekend of…
my plan was to jump out at the state line but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet
you couldn’t give us just one weekend
i told him this was a bad idea
what do we do kick them off
if we drop them off at a fire station they have to take them no questions asked
before you do please give me one more chance to apologize to emily
emily as i’m sure you know i’m considered an odd fellow but what you don’t know is that while i often say the wrong thing in my heart i mean well i think that you are a smart and wonderful woman you know and we all think that you can do better than koothrappali
so for all the times i’ve offended you and all the times that i’ll offend you in the future i’m sorry
good then i’ll be leaving now
oh it’s okay sheldon come with us
oh that’s very kind of you but i’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me let’s go stuart
you know i know he’s a jerk but i actually feel bad for him
and now you see the problem
come on you pain in the ass
wait i’m a pain in the ass too
are you relieved that you and raj were able to patch things up
at the moment no not really
here’s a fun postal fact the inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction so if you broke my right thumb that’s pasadena city police but if you broke my left thumb that’s the fbi
if i’m going to jail i’m killing him not breaking his thumb
oh i got a letter from my meemaw umm smell this
uh roses bengay and dr scholls’ foot powder
ah yeah grandma by calvin klein you know the last time i got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me i parked like a blind person
uh thank you oh meemaw got a new set of teeth oh but then she found her old ones oh so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth
fun like your comiccon spock ears and your around the house spock ears
oh my goodness she’s coming to visit
oh it’ll be nice to finally meet her
oh you are going to love her she is the kindest sweetest woman you’ll ever meet unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden in that case you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel
that’s not her that’s not her that’s not her that’s not her that’s not her that’s not her that’s not her that’s not her
really the old asian man is not your meemaw
and that’s not helpful you know i got her an iphone for christmas i’ll see where she is
oh that’s nice most people her age don’t embrace technology
oh no she doesn’t even know she has it no i had my sister slip it in her bag so that i can track her like a sea turtle
same as when we lost you at the zoo
uh for the hundredth time i smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart
still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider
meemaw i’m so happy to see you
i’m so happy to see you too
oh you got even smaller i love it uh meemaw this is leonard leonard this is my meemaw
hi so nice to finally meet you let me take this for you meemaw
no oh no now you call her constance i call her meemaw you have your own meemaw it’s not my fault she died when you were four
is that nice to say to your friend
can you please live with us forever
that’s ridiculous if you had a superpower and spent your whole life being told to suppress it when you finally decide to embrace that power why hide in isolation
i’m sorry and how much money did your version of frozen make
i’m just saying instead of let it go she should really sing look at me hiding in a freezer like a dove bar
she built an ice castle made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day you know what i saw you do today eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife
sorry for eavesdropping but did you know they actually had the song let it go in place before they finalized the story
yeah that’s true in fact they liked the song so much they retooled the whole script around it
which is probably why that movie sucks
here we are talking about frozen and yet you got burned
i’m so sorry but how can you not like that movie
i just think it gets more credit than it deserves
oh that’s what i said an hour ago
wow you’ve been talking about frozen for an hour
you should’ve seen us after the good dinosaur
it was a classic western set in the postjurassic period and it changed my life
very it’s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs
you were so cute huffin’ and puffin’ there’s amy i just know you’re gonna hit it off you both have the same fashion sense hello come in say hi to my meemaw
wonderful and the pilot did such a good job i gave him a butterscotch
that’s great and look at you sitting in sheldon’s spot you know i don’t even get to sit there
yeah and you never will ooh hey oh ask her to do the tissue thing do it ask her
isn’t that the best she’s like grandma spiderman
he’s been saying that since he was little i still don’t know what it means
oh well you two sit down and get to know each other i’ll get your room ready
oh now don’t you go looking through my suitcase for presents
if i did would i find any
maybe but you also might find my brassieres and bloomers
that’s a risk i’m willing to take
well this is so nice he’s so excited to have you here and…
okay now let’s you and me get something straight he may think that i came to bake him cookies but the real reason is to size you up
s s si size me up
sheldon’s mother may be okay with you but i’m not so easy
well i i’m i’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me
a texas special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell thank you meemaw
amy why don’t you look excited well you get to watch me play with this
oh i see you’re reading saga
yeah i hear it’s pretty good
it is and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover
i’ll take your word for it
i’m raj by the way this is howard
well i’ve never seen you here before claire
it’s my first time i’m looking for inspiration for this movie i’m writing
well screenwriter slash bartender slash a month away from living in my car
yeah i get that i’m a scientist slash party planner slash smalldog enthusiast slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist
that’s perfect do you think i could pick your brain for my movie some time it’s animated scifi for kids
he does and he has the lilo  stitch collector plates to prove it
excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life
here’s my number give me a call we’ll get together
what are you doing you have a girlfriend
so how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay
really you don’t think she’s attractive
i do i just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend
constance are you sure i can’t pour you some wine
oh no wine for me sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey
here you go meemaw i made it just how you like a lot in a glass
i’m curious why do you call sheldon moon pie
and i call her meemaw because well just well look at her
it’s interesting that leonard and penny know about his nickname and you don’t
oh well you know now now that i’m hearing it it does sound familiar
how could it i never told you and you never bothered to ask
so penny i understand you have a new job
yes i’m a pharmaceutical sales rep
oh it’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all a husband and a fulltime career
i have a relationship and a fulltime career too
why not you you just said it’s okay for her to work
well leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as sheldon does and as moon pie explained leonard’s work is more of a hobby
look i i get that you’re protective of your grandson but he’s an adult now maybe i understand what he needs better than you do
and here’s some more honesty i don’t like you very much
well maybe i don’t like you either
well no no no no no no no you have to like each other well we have a 4
but why other than you two fighting we’re having such a good time
the minute you left the room your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time i don’t need this
let her go and under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring
maybe we should give them some privacy
yeah yeah yeah you go ahead i’ll catch up with you
penny did you know about this
when did you get an engagement ring
my mother gave it to me and i had been thinking about giving it to you but then we broke up
sheldon will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this
oh i don’t think i could do that
sheldon tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger
i’m gonna opt out of that one too
who said i even want to be engaged to him and if i do i i don’t need your handmedowns
all right all right look l let’s all let’s remain calm and analyse this situation now i realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced
you leave the room and let the grownups talk now
don’t speak to him like he’s a child
thank you i’m gonna go next door and play with leonard
okay so you met this girl you exchanged numbers and you’re gonna meet up with her
just to help her with her screenplay
oh well i guess that’s not so bad
you weren’t there he was really flirting
hey it’s not my fault if american women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes
i’m sure it was harmless people flirt no big deal
really so it’s okay if i fl…
not you i own your ass the real question is where are you with emily
uh it’s hard to say i think we’re good but things like this make me wonder if emily’s really the right person for me i mean did you guys ever have doubts about each other
howie you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this
fine i had reservations about you too
well it doesn’t matter now ’cause i love how things worked out
me too and i think you’re even more beautiful than this rose
wow you know the last time i saw my grandma the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding
yeah right in there she ate it and everything
knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny knock knock knock leonard and penny
hey what happened is amy gone
no they asked me to leave so they could speak privately
yeah i know it was quite tense so here’s the million dollar question uh who wants to pop over there and get my trains
all right i’ve made up my mind i’m gonna do the right thing call this girl and let her know that i’m in a relationship
okay so far we’ve heard made up my mind i’m dumping emily
made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers
and made up my mind i’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no play it off as a joke
i’m calling her and the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got
you’re right it could totally happen
hi hi yeah it’s raj rajesh we met at the comic book store
hey what’s up figure out what time you’re free
actually that’s why i’m calling i um i just i need to let you know that i have a girlfriend
well no no i i didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out
i didn’t ask you out i just need help with my screenplay
wait are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe
why do you care if we have a vibe you have a girlfriend
come on i just told you i had a girlfriend the least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe
i knew it okay we did have a vibe this is exciting what’s my next move
right good catch anyway so i’m sorry to waste your time and uh and good luck with your screenplay
hang on we’re both adults we can still get together without it meaning anything
not me ever since you admitted we had a vibe i’ve been planning our wedding
look it’s just coffee i’ll ask you some questions about science and if you propose i promise to say no
okay that hurts a little but okay
bye all right so uh we’re meeting for coffee like two adults everybody’s happy easy peasy
yeah of course we have no secrets
when are you gonna tell emily
he lied about the cream cheese he ate the whole thing i saw him
look i know you think i’m not right for sheldon but trust me i’m his best shot you have no idea how much i put up with
i know more than you think i do
really you know what it’s like to have date night ruined because google changed their font
young lady if you think i don’t know what it’s like to live with a stubborn egotistical man then you’re wrong ‘cause that was my husband
there were days i wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen
well if you understand then why are you giving me such a hard time
because when you broke up with sheldon it hurt him deeply and i don’t want to see that happen again
hi sorry sheldon would like to say something to you
meemaw look i’m sorry but i have to defend my girlfriend to you
oh great now you’re gonna get emotional i always looked up to you and poppop i i know what a challenging man he could be but i saw you stand by him andand make him into a better person
yeah well that is exactly what i’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress
i think what sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together isn’t that right
fine if you feel so strongly i won’t stand in your way
so if he wanted to give me that engagement ring we would have your blessing
i just gave you my virginity woman cool your jets
yeah see if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy then a super massive black hole could work
this is great thank you so much i just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn’t too scary for children
and that’s how mommy and daddy met
hey did you ever tell emily about us
if any of you are looking for something to do on valentine’s day amy and i’ll be streaming our firstever live episode of fun with flags you’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric
penny and i have dinner reservations that night but any other time no
sorry bernie and i are breaking in the new hot tub if you know what i mean
you don’t sound very excited about it
oh i am i am i i guess i’m still wondering if emily and i are right for each other
does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with
you mean the strong sexy angel i can’t stop thinking about who can say
you’ve been talking about breaking up with emily forever why don’t you just do it already
yeah just get it over with
well you say it like it’s easy have any one of you ever broken up with anyone
you know uh once i ordered an uber by accident i just got in and went somewhere
so you really gonna break up with her
yeah i think so do you have any advice
well i have broken up with my fair share of guys i mean how many times did i break up with leonard
all right my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to uh tell the truth make it quick and be prepared for tears
oh i’m gonna do a precry before i go in there really dry myself out
you’re seriously breaking up with me
and you thought right before valentine’s day was a good time to do it

i hope you don’t think i’m just saying this because it’s valentine’s day but i love you so much
i’m gonna put this down your robe it’s not moving but i think it’s still alive

um i don’t know look it up on your phone i’m gonna wrap it in a towel
um taking care of injured rabbit okay make sure it’s comfortable and warm well it was just in a hot tub i’m gonna say check
to make sure it’s not dehydrated feed him an electrolyte solution if it’s not responding use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals yeah
this is ridiculous you know i’m gonna go talk to the maître d’

i’m still sleeping with you tonight
see if you can get a table by the window
oh boy it is crazy in here tonight huh glen
yes oh bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight anyway look we have been waiting a while and i just…
with all due respect ma’am there’s nothing i can do
you don’t have to call me ma’am
i mean we’re basically the same age
i’m 21 how old are you
just shut up glen come on let’s get out of here
rajesh it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone
yeah you know what’s not normal blubbering about emotions during a flag show unless that emotion is excitement over new zealand changing their flag yeah good luck you crazy kiwis we’re rooting for you
no sheldon’s right emily did say i always talk about my feelings too much
i suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship uh perhaps even a a red flag and speaking of red flags check out this sexy number from the former soviet union hubba hubba
oh uh wewe have another caller hi you’re on fun with flags
hewwo i want to talk about how wonewy i am too
yeah i’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if i’w ever find someone to share my wife with pwefewabwy asian 1824 no fatties
please all comments and questions should be flagrelated
aw wight is my pole fwagwewated
he’s eating that’s a good sign
you’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again
he is should we name him
it is valentine’s day how about valentino
nice a classic rabbit name peter rabbit roger rabbit valentino wolowitz rabbit oh look at all that chest hair and overbite of course you’re a wolowitz son of a bitch he bit me
no i’m not okay wild rabbits can have rabies
oh well why did you put your finger near its mouth
he’s so little i’m sure it’s fine
how can it be fine i just got attacked by a clearly antisemitic wild animal
it’s not what we planned but this isn’t so bad right
i was just hungry and cranky and i’ve never been called ma’am before
kind of when was the first time someone called you sir
sixth grade but i wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase so…
can you believe when i met you i was 22 i mean it’s crazy where did all that time go
mm you watched the bachelor a lot
yeah go ahead and make jokes but your thirties are almost over
you’re closer to 40 than you are 30
ha ha you married an old man tell you what let’s do something fun tonight
well maybe not but some day we actually will be old and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had
i know food fight i’ll keep thinking
look i know you both feel bad about being alone but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself especially when you just got out of a relationship
speaking of ending relationships when british honduras became belize they designed a new flag with a tree on it and i would like to hang myself from that tree
but amy when you and sheldon split up didn’t you start dating someone right away
well i i wouldn’t say right away
and actually it was three different men
thwee diffewent men damn girl way to give the milk away
oh looks like we just lost kripke
now oh looks like we just lost kripke
before emily i was alone for so long i just i don’t know if i can do that again
well you know here is something that might cheer you up the flag of the isle of man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants so you think you got problems
i have an idea maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting rajesh ladies i can attest that he is a kind handsome intelligent…
rich parents don’t forget rich parents
…spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh well that was quick hi you’re on fun with flags
hey i think i got cut off
i have a fwag question how many men did you have sex with
let’s see what’s young and fun uh we could go dancing
yeah no one wants to see that hey how about skinny dipping at the beach
no i don’t need any fish nibbling my business
oh there’s a screening of moulin rouge i heard the crowd sings along and stuff
that sounds fun when’s it start
midnight really you know what let’s do it
okay great oh wait uh it’s sold out
it says rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely
it’s not terrific lots of highly unlikely things happen you saw what’s under this robe and you still married me
if you’re really worried we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested
good thank you oh okay there is a test all they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain
oh cut off his head that’s where his little nose is
he’s not showing any symptoms i guess i’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe
howie this is just your hypochondria
no when i sat on the mute button and thought i’d gone deaf that was my hypochondria
we’ll find another time to tell him i’m pregnant
i mean this is the first time i’ve ever broken up with someone i just i didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much
all right nothing about this is fun no one wants to talk about flags and i haven’t spoken in over ten minutes so enjoy your new show internet dr amy farrah flower present with
i’m sorry for bothering you i’ll hang up now
no hold on rajesh you know you’re not being very sympathetic you know first hand that breakups are hard
fine if you insist on making me a part of this yes i knowledge how painful they can be however pain has an evolutionary purpose it provides information from the environment that uh behaviour isn’t good for us
wike when i feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a pwius
i’m just gonna push all the buttons
raj now i’m sorry you’re suffering when amy and i were broken up i also suffered and this may sound surprising but i’m grateful for having gone through it
yes i believe our relationship now is stronger than ever
when when we were apart i learned how important you are to me and i realize that when two people are in love sometimes they…
congratulations on a successful live show
cleaning up is not young and fun
it can be confetti fight maybe you should take a break i got this
did you know the singular of confetti is confetto
interesting and when would you use the singular
i’m glad you asked amy you have a confetto in your nose no no no no other side there you go
i don’t know maybe it says something on the back
continued on milk if you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast it didn’t work for my mom and it won’t work for you are we are see spoons for more
what could it be we are groot we are the champions we are family i got all my sisters with me
pretty positive that’s a joke because the pregnancy test says…
oh my god this is incredible we’re gonna be parents we’re gonna get to board planes first finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall
it is crazy oh i mean how do you prepare for something like this i’m not even sure i’ve held a baby before
oh it’s okay you’ll figure it out
but how’s this all gonna work do we get a nanny i mean can we afford a nanny and if we can we can’t get a pretty one ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage we can’t get an ugly one ’cause it’ll scare the kid
are we in a good school district you’re catholic i’m jewish what religion do we raise it and if it’s a boy do we get him circumcised people say it’s barbaric but if we don’t it looks like a pig in a blanket
calm down it’s gonna be okay
how’s it gonna be okay look at me i’m a mess and that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess and that’s even before we screw it up with our cutrate moderately attractive nanny
hey raj i read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system
oh i heard about that why didn’t you discover it
because instead of being in the telescope room i was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays
well you be sure to let us know when you win the nobel prize for boysenberry
ready to play when you are
yeah um in a minute i actually need to tell you guys something
if it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in december congratulations you’re the first one
i’m uh uh gonna be a father
because this changes everything what about comic book night uh what about playing games together what about our trips to disneyland how can we do those things with a child around
relax there’s room for two babies in this group
oh dear lord penny’s pregnant too
oh really okay well would a baby have to shave once every 11 days
would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken
i guess we’ll call this a draw
so i’m glad you guys are here there’s something i want to share with you howie and i are going to…
don’t say anything act surprised when she tells you all right how you want to do this
oh my god i can’t believe it
are are you not happy about this
i am ofof course i am i’m i’m sure it’s just the hormones but it’s weird howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years and i was all excited to tell him because i thought he’d be thrilled but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and i’m gonna get fat
no no come on come on you’re not gonna get fat you’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and and have the cutest little baby bump ever
easy for you to say skinny bitch sorry hormones
oh that’s all right all i heard was skinny
i wouldn’t make too much out of howard not reacting the way you expected him to
yeah i’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all
you’re probably right after we talked about it he started to calm down
i shouldn’t be raising a kid i don’t even eat my own vegetables
buddy i i think you might be overreacting
and then there’s this nose i mean what if he looks like me or worse what if she looks like me
not to mention the impact on our social circle everything’s going to change howard won’t be able to come over as much
well he could bring the baby here
oh but then we’d have to babyproof the apartment you know my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom i have two doctorates i still had to go in the sink
oh my god and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is
i read that in los angeles raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars
a million dollars god it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts that’s it i got to start earning more money right now
i know you could ask bernadette for a raise in your allowance
it’ll be fine people have kids every day you’ll figure this out
yeah come on this is great news and you know it
you’re right it is i’m just a little overwhelmed right now
hey you know what we should do
all get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us
go out and celebrate but not your worst idea
hey let’s go do something to get your mind off this
yeah yeah we should go out
uh i don’t know a bar
are you hungry how about that sushi place you love
doctor said i can’t have sushi
okay look we don’t have to go anywhere we can just you know stay here and hang out in the hot tub
doctor said i can’t go in the hot tub
maybe you should get a new doctor what he said you can’t laugh either
i’d like to propose a toast to our friend howard his um his big heart his beautiful soul…
and his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile
well look at this i bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money he can have all the kids he wants
and can keep a small portion of their heads dry
if i’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid i need to come up with a big idea to make some money
that’s easy for you to say you and sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model
that’s just research we’re never gonna make any money from it
forget helium the real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice
uh these are strong you should slow down
oh i’ll just take one last sip ah
okay how about this for an invention slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas
how is that a new invention
i don’t know all apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them
it’s true i like my giant ipad and my little ipad almost as much as my regularsized ipad
this place is terrific why why have we never been here before
the same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff you
that’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus where’s the bathroom
excuse me hey how you doin’
i hope the bathroom is clearly marked
doesn’t matter he’s headed for the kitchen anyway
maybe that’s an idea guidance systems for drunk people
they have that it’s called uber
hey in your supercooled helium experiments did you create quantum vortices
well if you made a guidance system couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope
wow i’ve never thought about that
and since it’s in a quantum state it would maintain an infinite persistence
groundbreaking revelations tropical drinks tell me this isn’t like the best episode of sex and the city
you may have actually just come up with something
you guys the bathroom here is amazing there’s people cooking in it
think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby
yeah yeah you get to buy toys and little clothes
i kind of already do that for howie
and whenever you’re hungry you’ll be in a minivan with cheerios all over the floor
oh and i just found a new travel cup for sheldon it only lets out three at a time so when did you guys decide to get pregnant
well we didn’t exactly decide we were talking about it and then one night we got a little reckless
oh come on we’re all grownups we’ve all done it
me me me too i’m a grownup and i’ve done it
fine we were out one night and things got a little spontaneous
well sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules and i went out…
wait i remember that hang on you did it at our place
i was headed to the bathroom and i passed howie on his way out usually he says do not go in there but this time he said hey let’s go in here
i’m sorry but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another
i do know what that’s like i really do
i’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this
this video the baby panda sneezes and the mama panda gets so scared
can you focus on what we’re talking about
all right look now this may be the rum talking but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 11 and 13 the magnus force issue should be negligible
even drunk he’s still smarter than all of us
and stronger who wants to see me beat up the bartender
if this is a viable thing we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems
look at that you’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up
i’m telling you you got this
of course he’s right you and i both know how hard it is growing up without a father that’s why i’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be
you’re welcome and if he has twins we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them
you guys can go in if you want
no we’re a team if you can’t go in we’re not going in
okay it’s not like she’s got the christ child in there all right checking text oh it’s leonard he says sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them
oh no sheldon’s drunk texting me
would you like to sing karaoke with us
how is that a drunk text
he used a period instead of a question mark he’s so wasted
your movie’s showing so you’re going could care less about the five you’re blowing theatre gets dark just to start the show you spot a fine woman sitting in your row she’s dressed in yellow she says hello come sit next to me you fine fellow you run over there without a second to lose and what comes next hey bust a move
you want it you got it oh you want it baby you got it
you want it you got it oh you want it baby you got it
you want it you got it oh you want it baby you got it
wonderful i’m being musically encouraged to bust a move if i knew what that meant i might just do it
i’m really glad you’re here can we talk
so you gonna get up there later
a microphone a room full of inaccurate depictions of polynesian religion and a captive audience to hear about it you bet i am
i’m sorry i freaked out this morning i want you to know i’m done being scared
it’s okay to be nervous i am too
thank god ’cause i was lying you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants but i’m also really excited i mean it
i love you mmm and i’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger
are we an item girl quit playin’
we’re just friends what are you sayin’
say there’s another and look right in my eyes
my first love broke my heart for the first time
and i was like baby baby baby ooh like baby baby baby no like baby baby baby ooh i thought you’d always be mine
baby i need your lovin’ got to have all your lovin’ baby i need your lovin’ got to have all your lovin’
ooh baby baby baby baby ooh baby baby baby baby
i appreciate this but you really…
land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims’ pride from every mountainside let freedom ring
i’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife best friend and now the mother of our child i love you bernie singing havin’ my baby what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me havin’ my baby what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me
you’re kidding what kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom
that was such a fun night
probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic
yeah yeah i was a little surprised when you decided to beatbox
oh that was really an asthma attack i just sold it
well i am so happy for howard and bernadette
me too so you ever think about it
babies well i’m not in a rush but someday yeah sure what about you
i think we’d make amazing parents
will you guys keep it down
on the other hand we might lack a certain maturity
so sheldon there’s something i’ve been wanting to talk about but i know it’s kind of a touchy subject
way to narrow it down to everything
well your birthday’s coming up and you’ve never let us celebrate it and i was hoping maybe this year we could
oh i suppose that’s a discussion we could have
okay great i mean it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything i was just where’d he go
w wait a minute you mention his birthday and he vanishes
well where’s that information been this whole time
just one example of how birthdays can be terrible now can we please drop this subject and pick a new one i suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew you know the answer it may surprise you
i’m sorry i brought it up
yeah what is the problem is it about getting older
please look at this porcelain skin i’m like a human sink
but it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you
can you please just tell me why
fine as you know i have a twin sister with whom i obviously share a birthday every year we’d have a party no one i invited would ever come because they didn’t like me
oh that part wasn’t so bad i didn’t like them either but then i’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends
when i was six they told me batman was coming to my party i waited by the door for hours closest thing to batman i saw was when a robin flew into the window
you realize none of those things would happen now
i do but why do you care if i celebrate my birthday at all
well you made my last birthday so memorable i wanted to return the favour
you know if you had a party now you have plenty of friends that would love to come
and we live here so we have no choice
very well you may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake presents and a shower of admiration and love but then you owe me bigtime
you have any idea what you’re getting sheldon for his birthday
he’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately maybe we could get him a fossil
well just don’t get anything jurassic he feels like that whole chunk of time has gone hollywood hey uh you know he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking batman was coming to his party
maybe we could get batman to actually show up
you mean some guy in a lame suit
or a real batman hey stuart didn’t you try to get adam west to do a signing here once
yeah but there was kind of a scheduling conflict he uh wanted to know when he’d get paid and i wouldn’t tell him
can i get his contact info
sure uh but just so you know he’s kind of a diva
oh yeah won’t take the bus he won’t pack his own lunch won’t let you spend the night on his couch
okay so how do you feel about party balloons
uh mylar balloons yes latex balloons no water balloons i will jump off the roof and aim for your car
i enjoy marching bands and tibetan throat singing
what kind of cake do you like
well my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting three layers and if there’s writing on it make sure it’s not all caps i don’t need my dessert yelling at me
hey so what was adam west like on the phone
uh nice guy but it was a little weird to hear batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy
you know adam west is my favourite batman well after michael keaton christian bale and batman from the lego movie
what he beat out george clooney and that’s something like i love me some clooney
thank you so much for helping us stuart
oh i i was just glad to be invited to be honest i don’t always feel like i’m part of the group
okay sweetie we’re on the clock here can you hate yourself and frost at the same time
hewwo i hope i’m not too earwy
no no no come on in
and how is the wadiant mommytobe
sounds like something a member of the group might know
yeah birthday party first pity party later
are you crazy how can you put michael keaton in front of christian bale
thank you that’s why i say keaton’s number one he brought a sense of humour to the role
oh if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour then i should be at the top of the list it should be me keaton kilmer lego bale and that pretty boy clooney
really you’re ahead of bale the man who personified the words i’m batman
i never had to say i’m batman i showed up people knew i was batman everywhere i went on the tv show mall openings julie newmar’s bungalow
i’m sold you’re ahead of bale
there’s another reason i should be higher on the list all those other guys had muscles built into their costumes all i had in my batsuit was 100 gradea west
can we just all agree we’re worried about affleck
is there a reason i had to leave my own apartment
well i think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated
but who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong
well i’m i’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one have to say you you do look good in that suit
maybe later i’ll uh get to see you in your birthday suit
but this is my birthday suit are you having a stroke because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party
so mother i’m surprised you came all this way for sheldon’s birthday
oh i was happy to he did come to my 60th
oh you had a party for your 60th
oh i wouldn’t call it a party just a few close friends and your sister and brother
you know to be fair we did get married in vegas and didn’t invite her
and i never did thank you for that dear
oh penny says everyone’s there are you ready
no i just i got a little lightheaded
oh do you need a minute
no no if i can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window i suppose i can do this
uh um uh thank you all so much for coming beverly wil wheaton adam west for some reason
batman finally came to your party
thank you this is all so thoughtful excuse me
i still get paid don’t i
okay i’d better go in there and talk to him
well don’t you think i’m the one who should go in
no offence but i’ve known the guy a really long time
well i’ve you know seen him without pants on
again no offence but so have i
well he’s seen me without pants on
okay this is ridiculous knocking sheldon can i come in
how do you know i’m not using the facilities
because you email me your bathroom schedule once a week even though i’ve clicked unsubscribe like a thousand times so what’s going on
i don’t know i looked around the room and i saw all the faces and the presents and it it was just too much
i get that hey you want to just bring a few people in here you know wil wheaton in the bathtub batman on the toilet it’ll be like the weirdest comiccon ever
i know that you worked hard to put this together i’m sorry i’m ruining it
oh pl you’re not ruining it look at some point raj will try to get everyone to do the electric slide now that will ruin it
i don’t think i can go back out there
that’s fine you know i hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you but what i hate even more is if i was there i would have tortured you too
based on this pep talk i’d say you’re still doing it
my point is there was a time i never would’ve been friends with someone like you and now you are one of my favourite people so if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom i’m happy to do it with you
well everyone will think i’m weird
sweetie you are weird everyone knows you’re weird but they’re all still here because they care about you so much
hewwo some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with weonard’s mother
leslie i can’t remember the last time we talked so much has changed
yeah uh um penny and i got married
wow congratulations you know actually i thought you’d be living with sheldon forever
yeah well don’t be a stranger
okay everybody sheldon is gonna come back out but i think he’s a little embarrassed so let’s all be extra nice okay
what are you wooking at me for i’m a saint but a sinner in the sack
hello everyone i i’d like to apologize for my behaviour i hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party so please enjoy yourselves oh this is quickly getting out of hand
if i may i i’d like to propose a toast um thank you all for coming tonight i know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents but i feel like i got the greatest gift the day he was born
aw amy that was lovely you know this is fun let’s do more someone else say something wonderful about me
wolowitz perfect everyone listen to wolowitz
okay then uh sheldon we’ve known each other a long time and it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend
little generic keep thinking we’ll circle back wil wheaton go
sheldon i know that we’ve had our ups and downs but i can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it we may have met because you are a fan of star trek but i have become a fan of sheldon cooper live long and prosper buddy and happy birthday
that’s how you do it wolowitz now you see why he’s famous and you’re not
sheldon i know the future holds great things for you and we all can’t wait to see what they are happy birthday dear
someone caw animal contwol there’s a cougar on the woose
and it was gandhi who said live as if you were to die tomorrow learn as if you were to live forever
and it was sheldon cooper who said let’s speed this up a lot of people want to talk
uh in the past i would’ve said something obnoxious like happy birthday dumbass but i’m not gonna do it you and i have both grown a lot and it’s just so nice to see you all again so happy birthday sheldon
oh oh now you know i hate change say it
happy birthday young man and if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today i’m also available for comiccons bachelor parties bar mitzvahs…
i can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said so here’s to you sheldon
thank you bernadette that was perfect
what you gotta be kidding me
sheldon we’ve been together so long it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life and believe me i try you make me laugh you make me a better scientist you make me crazy you’re more than just my roommate you’re my brother
thank you that that was wonderful
oh wait wait wait stuart didn’t get to speak
oh oh okay um uh sheldon i’ve spent most of my life feeling invisible but having you and everyone…
we’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday
thank you so much i can’t believe you’re…
oh you’re singing well i’m sorry
uh professor hawking if you just give us one second we’ll light the candles and we can all sing together
i was crushing it but all right
okay while they get the cake sheldon i just want to say i hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug
you know i used to hate these hugs now they’re just extremely irritating
ready when you are professor hawking
and a one and a two…
okay i gotta ask why are you wearing a bow tie
i’ve never applied for a patent before i wanted to make a good impression
is the impression that your first name is peewee
yeah well you’re an engineer end of joke burn
see he’s not wearing a tie
well he’s a patent attorney maybe his tie is pending
so i’ve reviewed your paperwork and it seems like we’ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope
well the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap
oh i don’t think there will be
yeah we did our own search
that’s nice but i think ours might be a bit more thorough
get a load of this guy
can you imagine if we make money with this
if we do i am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy
that old sad story guy gets a little money goes straight up his nose
just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75 of the patent
that’s outrageous this is our idea based on our research how can you possibly justify owning a majority share
hold on hold on so the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25
dr hofstadter this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts
well until you just said that mean thing kinda
and as far as mr wolowitz is concerned i’m afraid as a federal employee on loan from nasa your name can be on the patent but you’re not entitled to an ownership share
wait so this can turn out to be a financial success and i get nothing
well sometimes they give you a plaque
well that’s not fair we should all get plaques
sorry but we can’t sign this
couple of questions about the plaque
so have you been having any morning sickness
a little and it doesn’t help that i’ve got this heightened sense of smell
yeah the other day i sniffed out where howie hid the girl scout cookies no more tagalongs my ass
but now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with
hey guys hey penny i really appreciate you helping me with this i don’t know what to do
oh sure let me see it
i hadn’t spoken to emily since i broke up with her and she left this on my doorstep with a note
raj i got you this before we split up but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it happy belated valentine’s day emily
nice or is she trying to manipulate him
i know i mean do i open it do i return it
well she was pretty mad for all i know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk
you don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous do you
i know one way to find out sniff this
she’s pregnant she’s not a bloodhound
although i am getting a little machine oil i think it’s metal
you know on game of thrones balon greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box
well never hurts to have a spare
wow it’s an antique sextant sailors used these to find their position by the stars
what a nice gift for an astrophysicist
see she’s trying to get you back now that is exactly what i would’ve gotten you if i had any idea what it is or what you do
you know i have too much selfesteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her
you don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap
well what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves
we can’t it says on their web site as long as we work there they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with
great so they own my idea for a tshirt that says dumb as a bag of geologists
well our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all
or if we ended up making money from this sheldon and i could split our shares with you
to be clear leonard is referring to the gyroscope not the tshirt and mugs oh now they own the mugs
i guess that is a way around this you guys would be cool doing it like that
of course we can split any profits three ways
it sounds like a uh contract might be in order
sure we could write something up
but which one of us should be the party who…
once i found a stash of contracts under his bed it was weird
i wonder how much she spent on this
it doesn’t matter it’s the thought that counts
yeah yeah and beauty’s on the inside size doesn’t matter how much she spend
seriously guys i don’t want to know
oh come on you can’t say oh my and then not tell me
these things go for five hundred dollars and up
damn all i got for valentine’s day was a postcard saying my vermont teddy bear was backordered
okay so she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you
or she’s telling the truth and just being nice
maybe you’re right wow i am easy to manipulate phone rings oh guys it’s emily what should i do
okay answer it just be strong and if she starts to cry don’t make any promises and most importantly put it on speaker so we can hear
hey it’s emily is this a good time
was it okay i left that gift i’m really hoping we can be friends
um you think you’d want to grab a cup of coffee hello
i’m sorry i seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how i feel about this
i just i miss hanging out with you it’s not like i lost a friend it’s like i lost my best friend is there any chance you’d want to come over
i’m sorry i don’t think that’s a good idea
okay i’m just i’m having a really hard time but that’s not your problem that’s mine i i won’t bother you again but please know that you’ll always have a place in my heart bye raj you’re a good guy
goodbye emily that was rough you guys
i know but you did it i’m so proud of you
well anyway i’ll leave you to your girls’ night
are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us
no i kind of feel like being alone right now
well if you change your mind we’ll be here
say hi to emily for us
this contract looks good to me
i’ll say it looks good it’s in my proprietary font shelvetica
i want to say something obnoxious but it is easy on the eyes
i’m a little tired howie you ready to go
yeah one sec i just need to sign this contract
well we ran into a problem about my share of the patent so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally
sheldon did you draft the contract
ooh you’re gonna make out so hard tonight
so you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it
excuse me i’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting don’t need one now
bernie the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out
well i should hope so the whole thing was your idea
well to be fair howard’s idea was based on sheldon’s math
guys everyone is involved in thios okay howard’s invention sheldon’s math my original theory that spacetime was like a supercooled liquid which i’m sure penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now
if you want to sign a contract that sheldon whipped up go ahead
can i talk to you in the hall
if she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent she’s being patently absurd
okay you got it see i was afraid it was a thinker
i just want to make sure you’ve thought this through
what’s to think about we have an invention and want to move forward
howie you’re about to form a legal partnership with sheldon cooper
all right if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points then i don’t know if i want to talk to you okay i get it and it’s sweet that you’re worried about me but i can take care of myself
i’m not worried about you i’m worried about me i don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do
here we go with the ironclad logic again
you’ve tried to work with him before it hasn’t gone well why is this time gonna be any different
is the foetus helping you ‘cause that’s cheating
hey raj it’s claire how are you
hi i’m good really good well i don’t know why i said really good i’m just regular good i really just wanted to sound confident and that really was a real really not a fake really like the first really
i don’t know i lost track and i missed my exit so uh so what’s up
well last time we talked i had just gotten back together with my boyfriend and i wanted to let you know that things didn’t work out
really i’m sorry i swear i know other words
so if you were still interested
yes indeed absolutely indubitably i’m not even sure what the last one means but it’s another word and i know it so uh when do you want to meet up
uh i’m almost off work what are you doing now
right now well well actually to to be completely honest i’m stopping by to see my exgirlfriend because she’s having a tough time but it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything
let me guess the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn’t have her best friend to talk to any more
that’s exactly what she said how do you know that
i’m a girl it’s like page one out of the playbook
any chance you could send me a pdf of that playbook
they’ve been out there a while
i wonder what they’re talking about
if you guys would shut up i could tell you oh be cool be cool be cool
yeah but um we were talking and i’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership
are you suggesting a limited liability corporation ‘cause i did not llsee that coming
sheldon my concern is not with the money or anything it’s it’s with how you treat me
well i believe i’m treating you generously that’s why i’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own
are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours
no i am not saying that because i kept saying that this morning and leonard said stop saying that
see this is what happens every time we work together
you know what hang on what if sheldon had no choice but to be respectful
what is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about
no what i’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of howard
oh please any contract i sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics
yeah that too and scoot over part of your shadow’s on my spot
i’ll add it right now oh baby it’s addendum time
hey emily listen i’ve been thinking and i’m not sure it’s a good idea that i come over
hey so listen claire change of plans…
fine do what you want but she’s playing you
i don’t think so she sounded pretty upset
you mean like i was just really looking forward to seeing you i’m having such a rough day
emily listen i’m sorry but i can’t come by
i think we both know if i come over we’re gonna get back together and…
i told you i needed a friend what do you think is happening here
the the revisions i made start on page four
wow that is a lot of whereupons
you should see the valentine’s day card he gave me
article three as it pertains to this project dr sheldon cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward howard wolowitz including but not limited to mockery of engineering his height his hair his wardrobe and his insane belief that the ghost rider movie was quote not that bad
hang on maybe there should be a no insult clause about me too
wait wait wait what are these changes on page six
25 of profits due to sheldon cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of howard and bernadette wolowitz sheldon that’s so nice
that beats the onesie i was gonna get them from baby gap
oh i’ve always valued education over money and the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive i’ve been of your contributions
and i just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer
what i didn’t sign it yet
i hear what you’re saying but i’ve known emily a long time and i think she deserves the benefit of the doubt
all right it’s your life but you know how this is gonna end
as a matter of fact i do i’m gonna comfort her because i’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to
uh can you repeat that you’re breaking up
ah yeah i had to get a little creative because the s r and m keys on my laptop stopped working
deaw aby could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow
sheldon why don’t you get a new computer you know that one’s outofdate
oh but i like this computer
the video is failing and the sound is cutting out
i’m sorry i didn’t get that
the video is failing and the sound is cutting out
the sound is cutting out i can’t read that the video is failing
this is cool when was the last time you and i built something together
scientifically a little over a year ago legos last week in my room
if there was a nobel prize for millennium falcons that fall apart when you pick them up we’d be set
hey what are you doing here
we heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend
yup so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em
soup sandwiches and emasculation just like my mom used to make
there’s a lot of tedious setup but once we get through that it should go quicker
is there anything we can do to help
you know what this part isn’t that technical you actually could
wow really called my bluff all righty then
while we finish soldering these boards it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with teflon tape
i’ll show you how to do one
hey wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work i’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough he doesn’t think that’s funny
i got here as quickly as i could
you got emotional when that lab monkey died
that lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language
great now i’m gonna have that song in my head all day
look i’m i’m sorry for your loss but i think i have something that might make you feel better i got you a new computer
choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual you have taken away weeks of agonizing thought tedious research sleepless nights filled with indecision i haven’t i lost enough today
well the guy at the store said this one is great
oh oh the guy oh pardon me i didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy yeah tell me did the guy choose one with a 4k display and a thunderbolt port
yeah did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solidstate drive
yeah oh well was this guy rick from computer solutions on colorado
yeah well he does know his stuff
after you wrap the body in reflective tape the ends get teflon tape so we can get a tight seal
and it helps to have small delicate fingers so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and howard
i don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards
we had a full spool yesterday
what can i say i play hard i solder even harder
sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off it’s like a beer commercial
well we got to make a run to the hardware store
how can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder
well funny story so we have plenty of the 6040 tintolead ratio solder but the spools look a lot like the 6337 tintolead…
honey honey honey let me stop you that is is not a funny story
you want to come with us
i’m kind of getting into the groove here
yeah you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change
okay we’ll be back as soon as we can
i suppose i should set this up or would you like to rob me of that too
knock it off or i’ll start making wh sounds for words that just have a w
fine i’m sorry thank you for the thoughtful gift i really do appreciate it as you know i had become attached to my old laptop but i’m sure in time that this one will… jeepers creepers that started up fast
i thought you might like it
look at the 4k resolution next time we skype i’m gonna count all those nostril hairs
or you could just look into my eyes
but you only have two eyes you got a lot of nostril hairs
well you know as long as you’re happy
and rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it
oh uh no no no thank you
oh but he said you can get store credit
well no i just i i don’t want to recycle it and i don’t want store credit
can we please change the subject
okay how ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this
i’m not being weird i it’s hard to explain
it might be easier to show you
we’d have to take your car
and i’m gonna need you to sign a nondisclosure agreement
well i signed one before we slept together why not now
penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype
remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games
i know i’m lowering the bar so slowly this time next year she’ll have a coin collection
excuse me you guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie
well hang on what movie is it
oh i can’t tell you but it does star will smith
wait i bet it’s suicide squad let’s check it out
penny just said they’re having fun honestly you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon
okay we’ll take ’em but i swear if it’s will smith in shark tale 2 it better be at least as good as the original
i mean it’s crazy isn’t it i moved here from nebraska to be an actress and now i’m sitting in an engineering lab at caltech helping to build a prototype for a hightech guidance system
it is crazy it’s also crazy that i’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three
oh they went to the store to get solder which is metal you melt to make science things
since when do you work on weekends
i’m an astrophysicist the stars don’t take a day off
you were home alone and had no one to play with
well the cleaning lady was there but she doesn’t like me you need any help
okay that’s cool i guess everybody’s involved in this project but me so see ya
i feel bad should we have asked him to stay
will you please tell me where we’re going
sorry you’re on a needtoknow basis
i’m driving the car i need to know
no i meant turn right and you missed it maybe you do need to know
what are we gonna tell the girls
and now you’ve made it a problem
come on we’re a couple of smart guys i’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad
oh the boys had to drive all the way to san bernardino for the solder and got a flat
but we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back
hey guys thank you for being a part of our test screening you’re about to be one of the first audiences to see suicide squad
well i keep telling you good things happen to bad people
uh we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes enjoy
raj he really wants to see this movie
he’ll never make it in time
i know i want to make him feel bad
ha ha leonard and i are about to see suicide squad spoiler alert when i see you i’m gonna spoil it you’re a good friend
okay would you ladies please leave the room for a moment
i need to rub my genitals on their prototype
leonard and howard don’t have a flat they went to the movies look
oh you know what i’m gonna let them know that i’m here with you and that they’re busted
no you know what don’t don’t let’s let them think they’re getting away with it
yeah let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves
interesting i mean it’s not testicles on a cryostat but i like it
why do you have a storage unit
how long have you had it
do you want me to hold that computer
just wait you know what actually yes thank you welcome to my fortress of shame
i’m sorry what what am i looking at
it’s basically everything i’ve ever owned um every book every tee shirt every piece of broken electronics just all of it
i have a ziploc bag filled with all my old ziploc bags
okay well i would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of so i’m gonna need a minute
all right how are we gonna play this when they return
i know you guys should totally be making out with me
sweetie i know you think jokes like that are funny but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us
okay okay how about this they don’t know you’re here with us so you hide in the closet when they show up we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it you jump out
i love it i’ll be all like busted and they’ll be like what and then we’ll all be like oh yeah yeah i get it i wouldn’t make out with me either
in here is every clock radio i’ve ever owned calculators vhs tapes yeah oh sporting equipment
well oh it’s just a it’s a a golf ball that my brother threw at my head you can still feel the dent it’s right next to the hockey puck dent
okay why do you have a bin of pine cones
i used to collect them as a child the spiral of scales open in the fibonacci sequence a fact that when you tell your brother gets a golf ball thrown at your head
so why do you feel you need to save these things
i’d like to say it’s nostalgia but every time i think of throwing anything away my ears start to ring and i get butterflies in my stomach and then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats and then the the rats get eaten by…
okay i get it i get it
it ends with dinosaurs i’m sorry if you think less of me
really ‘cause every time i come in here i think less of me
because i’m a fraud no i purport to be a man of the mind i’ve been such a a vocal champion of the singularity but how can i leave my body behind and become one with the internet when i’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away
it’s okay sheldon you know i’ve saved a lot of weird things too
well um did you know i have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain i ever dissected
i have an old teddy bear i secretly wiped my nose on for years
oh man when i come out of the closet i’m gonna nail those guys yeah i heard it shut up
listen we did a stupid thing
we went to a movie and lied about it but we feel bad and want to make it up to you
so these are for you and if you’re not too mad we’d love to take you guys to dinner
oh well thank you for being honest
yeah you know i want to be upset but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype
don’t forgive them stay mad at them
what is he doing in there
well this is kind of anticlimactic
you know what wasn’t anticlimactic the end of the movie get this
and he’s back in the closet
so no one else knows about this
what good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her
that’s me your emotional outhouse you know if you ever decide you want to do something about this i’m i’m here for you
thank you i wouldn’t even know how to begin
i suppose i could try getting rid of the golf ball
i will always have the dent to remember it by
you did it do you feel okay
i’m glad i told you about the storage unit
well i feel closer to you now
oh i feel closer to you too you know it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime
what did you have in mind
you look amazing i mean this resolution is remarkable
i really had to go home for this
yes but it’s like you’re right here in the room
but i feel like i could reach out and touch you
it’s nice to get back to nature why don’t i do this more often what a beautiful forest hello little butterfly what’s your naoh
i was enjoying some virtual reality until you ruined it with your actual face
oh it’s car air freshener i was simulating the smell of the forest
that’s not what the forest smells like
why are you pretending to be outdoors you hate it
hmm oh amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness
buddy i am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there
well make your jokes but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return
okay if that’s true why aren’t there more genius squirrels
you may need this more than i do
oh do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log
you know if you really want to be in nature why don’t we rent a cabin
look i’m sorry when did you even get here i…
you know there’s a cabin in big bear that a doctor i work with keeps offering me
we could all go for the weekend it’ll be fun
excuse me here look up fun get back to me
you and i could still go and have a nice weekend
come on sheldon let’s go with them
i hardly think so you be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes bees bears snakes possums poison oak oh and last but not least teenagers with guitars
you know if that study’s real leonard might come back smarter than you
are you trying to manipulate me
well done it worked we’re going
come on raj give me a bag
no no you’re pregnant the only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow
uh raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store
did you get graham crackers i mean are wuh is the baby okay
i didn’t know you needed help running errands today
yeah ever since you told him i was pregnant he’s really been making a fuss over me
oh well i guess that’s kind of sweet
bernie i just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in los angeles i know my favourite but i’d love to hear what you think
uh what what you got goin’ on here
i can see that what team did you get
well we’ll be in the woods
anything you’d like to say to him
why are you so mean to me
what the hell are you watching
raj found all these childbirth videos online this one is of a woman giving birth in a river
okay that is the least jewish thing i’ve ever seen in my life you feel like raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff
i don’t think so he just wants to be part of the experience
all right if you say so what’s in the box
oh it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat
oh that’s cool can we try it
actually raj ordered it he made me promise to wait till he was here
so he can be part of the experience
i’m surprised he let us conceive without him
it’s a sore spot don’t bring it up
it’s so cute and rustic up here
i know did you see they still have a video rental place it’s like colonial williamsburg
well cell service is down to one bar so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid now’s the time
have you ever been off the grid before
once the battery ran out on my phone i had to wait for my ipad to turn on
i was afraid he was gonna eat me
raj just pulled up i’m gonna say something to him
leave it alone he means well
so you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little
and you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid too
he’s just trying to be supportive
just supportive not overthetop in any way
so nice of that doctor to just let you use it
well she is taking me to an indigo girls concert so hold that thought
okay well shall we check each other for ticks
sheldon all we did was walk in from the car
oh well suit yourself who wants to check me
on the other hand safety first
oh not our hike now we have to stay safe and warm
you know we could still go a little rain isn’t gonna kill us
have you been outside in the rain with sheldon
you’ll wish it would kill you
so what do we do now
eh most of the jenga pieces are missing and the scrabble only has seven tiles so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it move on
i don’t think i’ve lit a real fire before
ah it’s basic thermodynamics i’m sure we can figure that out
i could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow
that would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion
right so all we need is to…
look raj you’re my best friend in the world and i really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby
and of course howie and i both want you to be a part of all this
but we have to set some boundaries
the three of us aren’t having this baby just the two of us
oh okay yeah i get it i’ll back off
of course i’ll give you guys some space let me just get this out of your way
please bernadette let me leave with my dignity
hey you guys want to play a drinking game
oh well now we’ll never win you always play the drinking game
not the drinking game a drinking game
to be fair good at both
all right it’s called never have i ever the rules are simple someone says something they’ve never done but if you have done it you take a drink
hey now wait have we started do i drink what is happening
okay calm down i’ll go first all right let’s see never have i ever…
she’s trying to think of something she’s never done before this could take a while
very funny okay never have i ever… yeah you know what let’s just circle back
okay i’ll go never have i ever been arrested
no it’s only if you’ve done it
i can’t believe you’ve been arrested
well i’m not proud of it but i jaywalked
oh no it’s like a horror movie we’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac
i’m surprised you would do that
no i crossed in the middle of the street and normally i wouldn’t but i saw an aggressivelooking girl scout and it was the heart of cookie season anyway there was a police officer and he witnessed the whole thing
what he arrested you for that
no he didn’t do anything so i said you just saw me jaywalk why aren’t you doing your job you know may maybe i should arrest you for for impersonating a police officer
i feel like i just made a horrible mistake
but on the other hand i didn’t kick him out of our lives i just asked him to back off a little
is it baby hormones or actually sad
this game’s dangerous i could get you in trouble
well never have i ever used sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink
fine is that how you want to play this all right never have i ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals
never should’ve told you about alvin and the chipmunks
okay my turn um never have i ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed
all right my turn mm oh i know never have i ever kept a secret bank account because i think my wife can’t handle money did i win i feel like i won
i can’t believe this you realize i make more money than you
i don’t i know but this isn’t a big deal it’s just a little savings i put aside
we’re married we’re supposed to share everything
what you mean like your massive credit card debt
i appreciate the apology but it’s really not necessary i overstepped my bounds
no raj you’ve been great i just i need to start doing my part around here
well if that’s the case is there anything i can do to help
well not right now but we could try out that microphone you got us and listen to the baby’s heartbeat
really it’s okay if i listen with you
can i squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach
hey look at that it’s weird again
okay you have every right to be mad and what you said is true you do make more money than me so i had no right to do what i did and i’m so sorry i hope you can forgive me
how long have you had this secret account
a couple years but i just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies
well how much you got in there
six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here
my god leonard do you know what i could do with that kind of money
no i do and that’s why i hid it
what good is it if you don’t use it
uh you have shoes you love but never wear i have money i love but never spend we’re kind of a cute couple that way again i’m sorry i shouldn’t have kept it a secret
well i have a secret i’ve been keeping from you too
is it a secret bank account because that would be awesome
because i don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales i mean i know i make a lot of money but i haven’t been happy for a while
because i know how important it is to you that i’m having some success
okay really so you’d be fine if i went back to acting and waiting tables again
if that’s what you want to do yes
well it’s not what i want to do
doesn’t matter what i want look this job is gonna get me out of debt so i’m gonna do the grownup thing and see it through
well that is the grownup thing
you know never have i ever made love in the forest while it was raining
are you sure you can do this
hey who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector
i buried it there so we could go home
and i like to think i helped
oh never have i ever drunk milk past its expiration date
never have i ever cancelled a dentist appointment
oh uh never have i ever put my foot in the ocean
never have i ever honked if i liked anything
oh uh never have i ever thrown caught or touched a frisbee
never have i ever put salt on my food without trying it first
oh never have i ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator
well we all have a past
i have a question about batman batman is a man who dresses up like a bat manbat is a part man part bat hybrid now if manbat dressed up as a man to fight crime would he be manbatman
but wouldn’t manbatman just be a batman that was bitten by a radioactive man
but batman is a man you’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man that’s just manman
but what if manman dressed as a bat
no if a man dresses as a bat that’s batman but if manman dresses as a bat that’s batmanman
so does that answer your question
oh i haven’t asked it yet
oh that’s claire got to run
i thought you were back with emily
uh actually i’m seeing both of them
you mean like through their window from behind a bush
no i’m actually dating two women later
really the guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them how is that possible
i know scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models but in each case the world blows up
seriously that guy’s dating two women
what why did you get a party sub
people are coming over it looked fun
well we’re only watching game of thrones a party sub implies it’s a party
i like a party as much as the next man as long as the next man doesn’t like a party oh by the way don’t forget tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting
oh sheldon we don’t need a meeting every three months
hmm well it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting lucky for you it’s tomorrow
oh you know what i’m not going
well you have to go it’s penny’s first time leading the pledge of allegiance
this meeting is a waste of time whether we make the switch from post raisin bran to kellogg’s raisin bran should not require parliamentary procedure
you realize one of them has sugar on the raisins
you’re the only one who eats them
and yet you get to weigh in democracy it’s pretty cool isn’t it
i’m not going you can’t make me
well we’ll just see about that
he says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow
well why the hell did i memorize the pledge
you have fun i will not be attending
oh fine we don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to
of course it will require a vote unfortunately my official gavel is in my bedroom but luckily i have my travel gavel
there’s a motion on the floor i’m ridiculous do we have a second hmm hmm there is no second the motion is denied next time make sure you have the votes first that was embarrassing
can you please talk to him
well why are you fighting him on this
because i am tired of him always getting his way we don’t need a stupid meeting we don’t even need a roommate agreement and i hope that sandwich does cause a party
well i will still come to your meeting
well i should hope so tomorrow’s picture day
why are you taking his side
because it’s important to him and when we signed the roommate agreement we made a deal
you keep talking like that you’re gonna make colour guard
i know imagine if we were actually moving
no it’s just ever since i started dating claire and emily at the same time it’s exhausting
you’re exhausted try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it
but dude you’re so lucky getting to stay home at night with the woman you love
you are because dating two women i mean i can’t even remember the last time i slept in my own apartment i wake up and i’m like am i at claire’s or am i at emily’s is there a third girl i’ve forgotten about like where am i
i feel you i’ve been dating multiple women
you sure you don’t want to come watch game of thrones with us
you guys have fun i’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book
oh that sounds great a bed to yourself can’t even remember what that’s like
are you uptodate on game of thrones
mm i think so dragons snow zombies and all the hot guys are dead
oh i don’t know theon greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off
if it’s because you lost a stick i know where it went
you know you’re gonna make up with him can we just skip to that part
oh of course because i’m the only adult around here
tonight i’ll be watching a show rated ma and that stands for mature audiences buster
all right you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night
and i’d think you’d understand why i’m annoyed
all this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting
oh it’s just a meeting one simple meeting
meeting meeting bobeeting bananafana fofeeting feefi momeeting
i brought my famous spinach dip
yeah amy just one second meeting
i’m not sure if i’m hoping for a boy or a girl i mean if it’s a boy i’m gonna have to teach him to play catch which means i’m gonna have to google how to play catch if it’s a girl i mean they’re so innocent and you know how guys are
totally guys are the worst i mean look at me i let emily make me a frittata and i kept the leftovers in claire’s fridge that night i’m such a dog
i’m sorry have i been complaining about it too much
actually what you’re doing is pretending to complain but really trying to brag
oh i wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me
don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch
okay that i said but that’s a real problem you give a girl another woman’s bra and you will not be having sex with her that night maybe the other girl but not her
oh he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting
apparently perfect attendance isn’t cool any more
well i get why he’s annoyed
well then you don’t understand what’s happening see leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting this is what a generation raised on bart simpson looks like
well i know how he feels i never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings
no i don’t believe you i could tell
oh sheldon i never thought refiling a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating
hey did i say something to upset you
really because usually we walk side by side and i just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom
okay i think i see what’s happening here you’re jealous of me
oh please what could you possibly have that i would be jealous of
it’s not what i have it’s how many people i’m having it with
come on sheldon we’ll watch game of thrones over here
oh good go you know it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying i read the books don’t get too fond of this character
it’s not always because they die in one case it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time yeah but i won’t say who it is it’s brann
leonard’s being a jerk so we’re gonna watch over here
do you guys want to watch with us
as long as i don’t have to watch with him
fine i don’t want to watch with you either i’ll go over here
why do you get to pick
don’t tell me where to go
wait did amy make her spinach dip
and i’m gonna eat it all
oh i just ran out of patience with sheldon’s nonsense
tell me about it i’ve had it with raj too
you know like women men have a monthly hormone cycle dips in testosterone can cause irritability
interesting maybe my male cycle synced up with raj’s actual period
if sheldon’s testosterone dipped he’d become a butterfly knock on door oh maybe someone’s here to apologize
uh is this not a dressup party
was it ever a dressup party
howard didn’t you tell me it was a dressup party
i was told this is where to go if i’m mad at howard
thanks this thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike
well i’ll catch you up uh penny is angry at leonard leonard’s angry at me and penny i’m angry at leonard and amy raj is angry at howard and i’m angry at george rr martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for leonard
so what happened with you and howard
says i was talking too much about dating claire and emily and i accused him of being jealous
i’m jealous closest i’ve come to dating two women was that time i dated one woman
i don’t know how you put up with it he’s impossible i mean holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy
yeah cap’n crunch with crunch berries move on
anyway amy thank you for sticking up for me
oh i honestly couldn’t care less
well i just took your side ’cause sometimes i get annoyed at how close sheldon and penny are
well they argue all the time they aren’t that close
who’s always comforting him when he’s upset
who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick
i try to hide it in his peanut butter but he spits it out
okay and did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it
son of a bitch why is that funny
i don’t know i like the pain of others
oh well then you’ll enjoy this bernadette does the same thing with you and koothrappali
she defends him all the time
who told you to stop making all those gandhi jokes about him
well she did and human resources
who do you think told koothrappali to go to human resources
you’re you’re right it feels good
all right it’s almost game time get it game of thrones game time
oh perhaps it’s amy coming to her senses
you know you don’t need to use sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement
ugh amy why did you tell him that
because you were defending sheldon like you always do
oh yes you do you know you have a weird brothersisterelliottet relationship with him
what about your weird relationship with him
that’s different i’m like the little girl in poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the tv
um guys were there any nuts in that food
it just said italian sub i had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it
interesting fact in italian the morta in mortadella means death
i didn’t say fun fact i’m not a monster
boy stuff like this really puts things in perspective
why are you dressed like that
oh uh howard thought it’d be funny to tell me it was a costume party
no but he almost died so we’re cool
you know if you think about it tonight was kind of like a reallife game of thrones
well howard eating that pistachio was like when king joffrey got poisoned
okay well that was murder this was an accident
okay but you using sheldon to do your dirty work is like when cersei used the king’s guard to do her bidding
cersei uses her body to manipulate men penny just takes me to the lego store
okay oh how about this stuart’s dressed like a brother of the night’s watch and they don’t have sex
i’m fine just a little embarrassed i had to be carried down the stairs like a baby thanks
well the important thing is i said that big sandwich would ruin everything and i was right
hey jon snow how come your horse has a basket on it
how come your head has your face on it
they don’t wear bicycle helmets in game of thrones you’re thematically inaccurate but i applaud your commitment to safety
don’t you guys have anything better to do
better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike nope
that’s it you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store horse has a basket on it stupid… aaargh
knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard
i never got to ask my question about batman
if batman were bitten by a radioactive manbat and then fought crime disguised as manbat would he be manbatmanbatman or simply manbatmanbatbatman
is he still wearing the batman suit under the manbat suit
oh hey if you guys are free this weekend i won a night of wine tasting from work
how come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do
‘cause we’re not in it for the stuff we’re in it for the groupies
personally i find the notion of external rewards demeaning i pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery
but you always say that you want to win a nobel prize
i also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends but that you don’t remember
all right well let me know if you guys want to go
i would love to i do enjoy the complexity of an aged pinot noir
i’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken
well it sounds like a nice night we should go
wine again yeah no thank you i like my grapes the oldfashioned way in a juice box
well i’m going you couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall and you’re not stopping me now
i shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man
and i shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall
and now you know why i needed the massage
well we’re out bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant and she’s pregnant because we had sex and we had sex because well come on
yeah give her a break from well come on
well bernadette looks like saturday night it’s you and me
well it makes perfect sense because you’re an expectant mother you can’t drink alcohol i don’t like to you can’t have sushi i don’t like to you can’t go in hot tubs i consider them vats of sweaty people soup
oh come on roller coasters caffeine runny eggs i’ve been avoiding these things all my life and now because you’re pregnant you have to
the difference is she’s bringing life into the world and you suck it out
i guess we could give it a try
well little lady you’ve heard of party hearty get ready to party hardly
i bet you’d like a drink right now
hey you think it’d be okay if i brought claire to the wine tasting
sure i’d like to meet her
oh that’s great i’ve been wanting her to meet you guys too so this seems like the perfect opportunity
oh but i won’t be there
does this mean emily’s not in the picture anymore
okay help me out how are you doing this do they know about each other
they know that we’re not exclusive and we just don’t ask too many questions
you know it’s like how i play warlords of ka’a with you and elder sign with frank and alicia
you you and i spend a lot of time together can there be a little mystery between us
okay everything’s hooked up we’re ready
i am going to record this for posterity
here goes nothing this is the initial test of our prototype can we give it a little more gravitas
fine preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system phase one commencing
eh maybe it’s your voice i’m gonna see if i can get james earl jones to do it in post
hi yeah um i was wondering if you’re free saturday night all my friends are going to a wine tasting
sure i guess if you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step
why would it be too big a step
i don’t know i just don’t want things to get weird
nothing to worry about people meet people all the time and it isn’t weird i met bon jovi once which you’d think might be weird turns out total sweetheart
okay but you and i have been keeping things casual uh will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend what if i like them and they don’t like me what if they like me and i don’t like them
boy it wasn’t this hard with bon jovi i said you rock he said thanks man and that was that
oh i found a scratchandsniff book about wine tasting it teaches the different flavour notes to look for
i mostly just smell my nasal spray
since my preschool got a bunny
hey are you still hanging out with bernadette tonight
yes and we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves
or caffeine tobacco sushi soft cheese processed meats and jacuzzis which can all be harmful to an unborn baby
no honey baked ham in a hot tub got it
oh no bubble baths either they can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection
oh and no swordfish king mackerel shark or tilefish which are all high in mercury
oh and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings uh nono cat litter boxes no paint fumes
okay we’re leaving love you bye
oh we’re the first ones here
you know i don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out
oh i do it was three years ago
oh yeah and we said we should do it more often and and and and and here we are
so sheldon and bernadette are hanging out
i know what are they gonna talk about
i don’t know i really don’t know
oh she’s meeting us here hey guys do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship we’re just keeping it casual
oh so i shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem
yeah i know you’re teasing but watch out for karma
hey penny isn’t that your old boyfriend zack
are you gonna say hi to him
hey while you decide who was better in bed big hot zack or wheezy little leonard neener neener
oh the bubbles tickle my nose i’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it
so what do you want to do tonight
oh i have quite the evening planned our foetusfriendly festival of fun begins with an indepth look at the world of model trains and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast
you get where i’m going here
just a whole lot of afrin
oh zack hi you guys remember zack
hey did you two get married
cool ‘cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me then broke up with me and then dated me one more time before going back to him i was always rooting for you two
so how’s the science world what are you guys up to
we’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented
but we won’t bore you with the details
are you kidding i love science einstein stephen hawking mike degrasse tyson
yeah you know the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist
well we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems
what’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely
angular momentum i was wondering about that
you could put it in a satellite or a rocket and it’ll run forever
cool could it be used for missiles and war stuff
yeah but we didn’t create it for weapons
and i doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system
is it better than the one they use now
huh you sure you guys are smart
ho gauge trains are 187th scale n gauge are 1160th scale and that brings us to z gauge at a you could easily swallow it don’t ask how i know 1 to 220
i’m sorry i have to ask
when i was five i ingested a z gauge locomotive i spent the next three days saying i think i can pass it i think i can pass it i think i can pass it
what is it about trains that you like so much
what an interesting question when i was a child life was confusing and chaotic for me and trains represented order i could line them up categorize them control them i guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t
well other than when they’re chugging through your bowels these things are magic
i have to admit i’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this
same reason i don’t talk about ass cancer it’s not a pleasant topic
you can’t let this stop you almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes
it’s true even einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons
e equals mc squared yeah e is for energy m for mass and c for the speed of light
oh leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer
hey claire good you’re here guys this is my friend claire we’re casually dating and there’s no need for any further questions about it
would you like a glass of wine
and last but not least this is one that i like to call star wars toast because it has a light side and a dark side all righty it’s time for dungeons  dragons
dungeons  dragons that sounds about right
you’re gonna enjoy this i designed it especially for you
okay but just for a little bit
oh i have a feeling that once you start you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop
your name is bernatrix you are a warrior queen you’re strong beautiful and tall
oh i like the idea of being tall
i think you’re gonna like a lot of things i have in store for example in this world only the men get pregnant so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs
this is getting fun what’s next
you’re parched and weary from battle you stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest most delicious ale in all the realm
oh i haven’t had a drink in months
i storm in slam my sword down and say barkeep bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin
so claire we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you
boy you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice
zack this is my friend claire
why’d you say she’s your friend
why is he being casual with you you seem great
why are you being casual with her she seems great
maybe we should take a step back
take a step back i’m not a young man any more
no i mean reevaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system
but i got a baby on the way i got to make some money
what good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about armageddon
okay let me stop you right there we absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world
because no one from the future has come back to kill us
okay then geez how much wine did you drink
not a lot i just couldn’t start until you walked away
the hell prawn lunges out of the hot spring you block it with your shield do you attack
three giant red ones and they never blink it’s unsettling
i stab it in the middle eye
good choice critical hit your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain with its final dying gasp it says you have reduced me to a pile of sushi enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce it’s low sodium aaaah
okay i guess i should eat the hell prawn
using your sword you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner you slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints as you happily close your eyes you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been the end
wow this night turned out to be so much more fun than i thought
oh the fun doesn’t stop you’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast
thank you for this you know ever since people found out i’m having a baby i feel like i became pregnant bernadette it was nice to take a little break tonight
i can understand that from the moment people realized i was a genius i’ve been sheldon the genius although i’ve never really wanted a break from that so i suppose i don’t understand which is ironic ’cause you know genius
you’re welcome and any time you need a break from being bernadette the pregnant bernatrix the warrior queen is here waiting
i might just take you up on that
well mind you now that offer’s only good until the third trimester i can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot
hey dude you’re killing me with claire
i mean come on look at you you’re classically handsome you’ve got a swimmer’s body next to you i look like me
oh man i didn’t mean to do that but i do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body which incidentally i got from playing marco polo at the ymca
yeah okay just do me a favour and stop talking about how great claire is
anything for you my little foreign friend
so i got to ask does raj bring around other girls
uh you know i’m not really around that much amy knows much more than i do
i don’t think you have anything to worry about raj is a terrific guy loyal to a fault
yeah he still has an aol address
i see what you’re saying she’s not so great
don’t listen to him he says crazy things all the time uh watch marco
so uh what are you guys talking about
your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating
why would you do that i specifically asked you not to do that
wow maybe none of you guys are smart
oh i overdid it myself last night hair of the dog
hey did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system
no it did at first but then i talked it through with frank and alicia and they really helped put things into perspective
leonard friends are like toilet paper it’s good to have extras under the sink
see i remembered because if it looks like kim it’s kim if it looks kind of like kim it’s kourtney and if it looks nothing like kim it’s khloe
oh that’s a venn diagram and i remember because i thought to myself venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram
oh well we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases
hmm atom of hydrogen adam of maroon 5 mic drop
i’m sorry who is mike drop
oh hey penny do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother
hey penny um since you’re already gonna be at the airport do i need to go
why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport
well i can do without the 40minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life
she can cover it in a car ride i could do 40 minutes on your posture alone
you really want me to pick up your mother all by myself
hmm i just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond
or a way for you to avoid her
i don’t know what he’s putting on those cards but you are smarter than ever
fine if you really want me to i will pick your mom up
yeah you know what she is my motherinlaw and i’d like for us to have a good relationship
that is very mature of you so i’m gonna go ahead and say suckah
oh easy bill nye the science guy
creepy old dude from dancing with the stars
did you guys see there’s an avengers screening joss whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session
oh well i have a few questions for him about the last avengers movie and a whole lot of answers
uh it’s tonight but it’s firstcome firstserved so we should probably get there early and wait in line
penny’s busy with my mother so i’m in
oh bad news amy’s making me go shopping with her later so looks like none of us can go
you do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you
in fact that’s usually the trick to it what time do we need to get there
it’s not a big deal go shopping with amy and we’ll save a spot in line for you
you don’t have the authority to save places in the line if i do that i’ll be cutting
people do it all the time
you know the golden rule of line etiquette no cuts no buts no coconuts
if you really care that much there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines
people are actually waiting in lines as a job boy makes me feel better about my life
some of these guys make over 20 an hour
and now i feel worse again
i’m not surprised leonard chose to avoid picking me up he’s battled intimacy issues his whole life does he have difficulty maintaining erections
wow didn’t even make it out of the parking lot uh you know what enough about leonard let’s talk about you what would you like to do while you’re here
dear i’m a psychiatrist you don’t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me
well i’d actually like for us to be close but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs
very well what’s the last book you read
um does pottery barn spring count
penny it’s only natural to want your motherinlaw to like you and i acknowledge i can be an intimidating person so what can i do to make this process easier for you
uh for starters maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything i say
and how does it make you feel when i psychoanalyze everything you say
oh sorry didn’t know you made those hey listen what if we have a little motherinlaw daughterinlaw dinner tonight
so just the two of us
or i invite a few girlfriends ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine
what are you doing here you’re not sheldon
i thought that might come up sheldon hired me to go shopping with you
hold on he paid you to get out of spending time with me
no it’s not like that there’s a long line he’d rather stand in so what are we doing old navy buildabear i get paid either way
you sure i’m happy to hold your bag and sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick
can you understand why i might be annoyed right now
look lady i just work here
we’ve waited in a lot of lines together haven’t we
remember when we camped out for the doctor who panel at comiccon
yeah sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do
waking up wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets
stuart what are you doing here
sheldon you are the most inconsiderate person i have ever met in my entire life where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend
i don’t understand you were happy to do this when i hired you why why are you upset with me now
oh i’m not upset with you but amy’s pretty bent out of shape so she hired me to let you have it
well i suppose turnabout is fair play
you’re darn right it’s fair play you selfish jerk
you know just when i think we’re making progress in our relationship we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed i mean if he didn’t want to go shopping with me why didn’t he just say so
maybe he couldn’t get a word in edgewise
i’m sorry i’ve been going on and on
oh it’s all right dear sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind it’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying
i called him babe once he asked me to get a drug test
well i do admire your resolve you’re an extraordinary woman
you know she’s my motherinlaw why can’t i bond with her like that
amy’s with sheldon who she loves like a son you’re with her son who she doesn’t
do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him
oh well that still could be a big step for sheldon
three minutes and he used a kitchen timer i felt like a softboiled egg
you know being in a relationship with leonard also comes with its challenges
yes well what can you do
maybe it’s sheldon here to say he’s sorry
bernadette i’ll give you five dollars to slam the door
i would have done it for three
boy all this standing’s making me tired good thing i brought my collapsible stick chair
not the stick chair you look like an idiot on that thing
sticks and stones may break my bones but chairs on sticks are comfy
hey is everything smoothed out with amy
uh no she’s still pretty mad
did you make the apology as sincere as i would have
i said sheldon says he’s sorry
oh well that’s laying it on a little thick
you think it’s time you apologize to her yourself
i suppose so but if i get out of the line i’ll lose my spot
i’m happy to hold your place till you get back
consider it my way of getting more of your money
so beverly did you know penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company
oh i didn’t realize you two work together
well we don’t exactly i’m a microbiologist for the research team
oh what are you currently developing
that’s interesting i just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety
oh was it uh dr jenofski i just saw his ted talk
well let’s get back to penny hey weren’t you telling me something great about your company car
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
hello everyone oh beverly good to see you i’d love to chat but there’s a line that could start moving any minute so let’s do this amy a proper apology requires three steps step one an admission of wrongdoing amy i was wrong step two a promise never to repeat said action amy that action will never be repeated and that’s a promise step three an earnest request for forgiveness amy i hope you can forgive me and i hope you do it right now ’cause there’s an uber waiting downstairs and i don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver ganesh
oh thanks you’re a peach beverly we’ll catch up soon bernadette it was a pleasure as always penny you have spinach in your teeth
how long have i had spinach in my teeth
you look like you come with a kickstand
you can’t make me feel bad
so when the aliens brought you back they just left the probe in
it went well yeah i’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry the times you do really puts them on their heels uh stuart i relieve you of your line duties
anyone else need anything before i go
i’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of raj
you look like tigger if tigger looked like a jackass
uh if you ever need a reference or anything just let me know
did you see that he just cut the line
he’s just joining his friends it’s fine
no it’s not fine it is a breach of line etiquette
we’re near the front of the line we’ll get in either way
what if every person in front of us let someone cut
what if each of those people let someone cut
but then each of those people let someone cut
we’d still get in but first i’d hit you over the head with his stick chair
uh uh i couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line
oh uh i’m with my friends it’s cool
well no it’s not cool if there were reserved seating and we all had tickets that would be fine but this line is firstcome firstserved not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served right here
you need to go to the back of the line
uh who made you line monitor
mrs wunch in fourth grade and my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great
boy i wish i could say no
that was very nice of sheldon to apologize
well he’s come a long way or a short way very slowly so it feels like a long way
your relationship with him is fascinating i’m preparing to write a book on highachieving couples and i would love to interview the both of you
oh sure i’ll i’ll talk to sheldon about it you know bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut
really do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well
do i think he’d be interested sometimes i hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom
wonderful i’ll give you my contact information
um you should probably talk to penny too
okay you know what this is ridiculous i’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day and clearly i’m getting nowhere
well are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation
what i was seeking was some sort of friendship but at this point i’ll take you not insulting me to my face
my intention was never to insult you
you’ve been doing it all day do you even know what an insult is
well it’s not a clinical term but one example would be your marrying my son and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place
what about joss whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rulebreakers and linecutters
the avengers are rulebreakers being vengeful is in their job description
they work for shield which is a sanctioned department of the us government do you work for a sanctioned department of the us government
as a matter of fact i do at a little place called the dmv
he’s got him there the d even stands for department
excuse me excuse me can i please see a show of hands who here takes issue with this person cutting the line
well what a sad state of affairs that you’ve all been so ground down by life you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you
i can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up and it’s not because of your chair
you know right now at the back of this line there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in because this person simply doesn’t care yeah well 61 years ago there was another person at the back of the line and her name was rosa parks
okay you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here
now let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps and stand up for ourselves and and i realize that she stood up by remaining seated but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that now i ask you again who here takes issue with this person…
why should we listen to you you cut the line yourself
if you’re feeling dizzy it’s because the tables have turned
excuse me i paid someone to wait in line for me and then when i arrived he left so what you saw my good woman was swapsies not cutsies oh no no no no wait i ask you all again a show of hands who here takes issue… well stop moving he’s gonna get in
no i can’t this isn’t right
now now you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer that’s all anyone could ask
to be honest i’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all
i’m still human penny not getting invited to my own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore
i know how you feel she didn’t invite any of us
it was spur of the moment
but we did get to see a live stream of it on the internet
i could’ve watched it on the internet
thank you so if we would have asked you to come to vegas to see us get married you would’ve come
no i would’ve said you’re making a huge mistake but an invitation would’ve been nice
you really think we made a mistake
at the time i did but i’ve never seen leonard so happy so perhaps i was wrong
wow okay well um how about this maybe while you’re still in town leonard and i could have another small ceremony you know if you’re interested
i would find that perfectly acceptable
she would find it perfectly acceptable you guys saw it we bonded
howie you doing okay you’ve been in there a while
i’m fine be right out am i an american hero well that’s a good question jim don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet he’s a hero to all the nations of the earth okey dokey i think i have time for one more question
oh sheldon invoked rosa parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad but only the white people felt bad
ugh i should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains black history month
how’d it go with my mother
uh you know it started a little rocky but i think we got to a good place
yeah and when i dropped her off at the hotel she even gave me a hug
did she think you were choking or… i’m sorry that’s great thank you for spending time with her
no problem um so listen i don’t know if you have any plans next weekend but i kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time
wait we’re gonna get married again
yeah kind of but now we can invite our friends and family
seems like a lot of trouble for a hug
come on it’ll be fun and you know your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one
look in our defence it was kind of a spur of the moment thing and also we don’t like her
leonard come on she’s your mom if we can do something to make her happy why wouldn’t we
i just said why we don’t like her
hey look then forget about her let’s do it for us we could keep it small and informal this time we can invite our families
is your brother out of prison
i’d love it if my dad could come
oh you have to invite him i haven’t seen him since the divorce
oh he’s like a different man he stopped twitching and i think he grew an inch and a half
well then it’s settled yay so funny i never thought my second marriage would be to you
okay so it’s not a legal ceremony it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it
so there’s no maid of honour
huh but if i were to say wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you you wouldn’t be able to stop me right
i don’t see how i could
i was kind of hoping you would
wait now i’m just some lousy maid of honour
hey good news i just got off the phone with my mother she is coming to the wedding
okay wait you’re inviting people to our wedding
yes i’m inviting people to our wedding yeah i’ve already asked stephen hawking and robert downey jr and now don’t get your hopes up ’cause he’s pretty busy but erno rubik
seriously he invented the rubik’s cube
okay fine but why would you invite him to our wedding
because despite his fame and fortune he strikes me as a lonely man
well it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for leonard’s mother
yeah i’m also doing it for leonard i think this could really help their relationship
how dare you invite your father without consulting me
sorry but i don’t think i need your permission to have my father at my wedding
you do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair
i know and there’s no excuse for that
he claimed i was cold emasculating and hadn’t shown him any physical affection for years
i was wrong there’s three excuses for that
look the system is maintaining its own stability the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation
you’re right you realize what this means
yeah i do it’s proof of concept we’ve got a workable guidance system
thanks hey i just got an email from the us air force
hmm we request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system provisional patent 62295118 that’s weird
is there a window around here we don’t know about
i’m sure it’s just a coincidence
yeah of course what else could it be boy do i love america
i was speaking to your young lady
you know that doesn’t work for me let’s stay with mrs cooper
wuwu what that’s what i called you till i got to know you better
it was so nice of leonard and penny to invite me
i’ve always had a special place in my heart for leonard taking care of my baby all these years
excuse me i take care of him
sure you do so who else is coming to this shindig
oh well the usual gang penny’s family is coming tomorrow
yeah and leonard’s mother’s already here
mother she’s an atheist not a vampire
either way let’s stop and get some garlic
so mary how have you been
well thank you so much for asking i’ve been well and you
i don’t know what we were worried about they’re getting along great
sheldon tells me your husband’s coming
i think i can see my breath
i can’t believe i was so naive the military is just gonna take over the whole project and you know what happens if we object we disappear like off the map like every american idol winner since season four
am i am i what what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and i’m no longer in it that chess club picture is now just david zimmerman and elaine cho
okay look i’m on the air force web site and the department that emailed you is in charge of acquisitions so maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention
oh please that’s not how it works you saw et avatar jurassic world the military just shows up and takes over
you do realize those weren’t documentaries right
i’m sorry you find this funny
no i was just thinking about jurassic world boy that was terrible
oh we have to use the stairs
uh i don’t any day now
well the stairs are fine besides your mother is up there maybe i’ll have a heart attack and not have to see her
hey i i know things are a little rough with you and mom but i’m really glad you’re here
me too i should have never had that angioplasty because i feel fine
penny’s really looking forward to seeing you
ah she’s a sweetie you got a good one there leonard
how the hell did you do that
oh well happy to be here and congratulations
hello to you you wrinkled old bastard
all right now i’m starting to sense a little tension
all right you two don’t start penny and i are throwing this second wedding for your benefit can you please not ruin it
oh look at that you can apologize
you know the bible says forgiveness…
uh who’s hungry we have a reservation at the best restaurant in town
it only got threeandahalf stars on yelp
i don’t know what to do it’s the air force i mean should i respond to their email ignore it
you can’t ignore it it’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist
guys come on we’re meeting everyone for dinner
one sec i’m just afraid if i respond then they’ll know i got it
oh dude the minute you opened that email they knew you got it i mean they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now i love america
are you done with this nonsense
it’s not nonsense this is how the us military works
oh if it’s even the us military it could be foreign military pretending to be american
you’re right we turn our guidance system over to them next thing we know they’re using it against us
i also love the enemies of america
penny i hope the example of my failed marriage to leonard’s father doesn’t discourage you from the commitment you’ve made to one another
although alfred and i had a lot more going for us than you two
mom please save something for the toast
so alfred what is it that you do for a living
oh i’m an anthropologist i study ancient peoples and cultures
my goodness so all the way back to the flood
well on that note there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology
i don’t have a mythology i have the unerring word of god but that’s very interesting
oh i i didn’t mean to disparage your faith actually i admire it
yes yes i’m an agnostic myself but i have prayed many times to god to turn my wife into a pillar of salt
well he came close turned her into a giant block of ice
howard there must be someone at the university you can go to for help
are you kidding they’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place
what about the guy on the channel four news you know four on your side maybe he can be on your side
i’m being harassed by the government not trying to get to the bottom of a dogwalking scam
oh stop you know what’s really happening all the movies you’ve watched the tv shows the comic books they’ve completely twisted your thinking no one’s after you no one’s listening to you no one cares about you
i’d like to think the four on your side guy cares about me
you know beverly i know you and alfred have your differences but if you think about it if you hadn’t married him there’d be no leonard so that’s good right
is that howard in front of us
oh god i think someone’s following us
i’m not being ridiculous he’s right on my tail
uh turn left here and see if he turns with us
well why is he turning here the restaurant’s the other way
i don’t know he uses that traffic app maybe there’s an accident
it’s probably just a coincidence speed up a little see if he stays with you
well go faster you’re losing him
you know what flash your lights let him know it’s you
he’s flashing his lights what’s that mean
i i think he wants us to pull over
do not pull over i’m not raising this baby alone
so after your husband passed you never remarried
no just focused on work and the church
ah and what do you do
well they’re lucky to have you
do you realize what’s happening here
yeah i do they’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal
what took you guys so long
oh we were following howard but for some reason he turned off his headlights and went up a oneway street
oh just mary and i getting to know each other a little
leonard your father is just charming
he’s also broke did he mention that
okay mom you sit over there
yeah i’m gonna call bernadette and see what’s keeping them
if i’d known you were broke i wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread
hey penny what are you talking about oh that was you long story why don’t you go ahead and eat we’re gonna be a while
i’m telling you i’m not on drugs the government’s out to get me
now one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that neanderthals and homo sapiens frequently mated with each other
well that certainly explains my marriage to sheldon’s father
that’s funny because my father was not a very clever man
uh i would like to propose a toast to my wife and bridetobe
penny i’ve always known i loved you but this last year has shown me that i also love being married to you thank you for saying yes
oh thanks for asking until i did
i uh i would also like to make a toast
leonard i am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you
what the hell is that supposed to mean
why don’t you take a pill
what i really needed was a blindfold
all right everyone calm down let’s all remember what it says in the bible
oh dear woman can you please read another book
when god writes one i will
um if if we want to order the soufflé we might want to get on that
leonard if you don’t mind i i think i’m a little tired i’m gonna call it a night
i’m a little tuckered out myself so i will see you all in the morning
would you like to share a cab
oh so am i can i interest you in a nightcap
i think it’s pretty obvious they don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread
my father’s not texting me back
‘cause they both turned their phones off
i don’t like this at all
you realize you and i could become brothers
we’re not gonna be brothers we’re not gonna be stepbrothers go to sleep
i hope you’re right ‘cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird
okay do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother
are you saying that because the things are unspeakable
your parents are old anything unspeakable was finished by 9
i’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward
god i thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable but now this
hey if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking
okay i’m gonna go pick up my family like an hour and half two hours depending on traffic
oh hey and do yourself a favour all right when beverly gets here do not bring up last night all right as far as you’re concerned you don’t know anything you didn’t see anything i want you just to play dumb
it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example
what oh hi okay hey there i got i’m sorry i got to go now
i wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me but unfortunately i cannot attend
whuh are we still doing the dumb thing okay why what’s wrong
i just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me
oh golly however did he humiliate you
do i say stop what or just throw in the towel
i don’t see why i should have to watch your father parade around with some biblethumping bumpkin
oh excuse me that is my mother you’re talking about however accurately
okay beverley aren’t you overreacting a little all we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap
not helping buddy mother penny and i really want you to be part of this please stay
yeah plus if you leave alfred will know he got under your skin
you know also if they did have coitus we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist
it is funny when you think about it
maybe to you you didn’t get a 500 traffic ticket
because you were driving like a lunatic
hey if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic then yeah okay
it didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over
i have performance anxiety you of all people should know that
i have the right address don’t i
do you know where i can find him
may i ask what this is about
oh i can’t wait for you to meet everyone i told them all about you
like what do they know about your brother
uh not everything just like the jail and drugs part
the world doesn’t need to know our problems
hey look they got walgreens here too
you really think it’s helpful to change the subject wyatt
just trying to make this a happy trip dear
so uh randall can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in california
well good thing i was a nonviolent offender otherwise i couldn’t have left the state
all right that’s enough jail talk
penny knows where i was she sent me cigarettes
he was cooking and selling crystal meth susan i think we can let the cigarettes slide
stop trying to be the cool dad you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it
that’s great now they know where i live
what are you talking about they’ve always known where you live
yeah if you want to go off the grid you have to move out of your mother’s house
can we take a moment to discuss that i just lied to the government for you
yeah i would not have done that for you
howard please just call the man see what he wants
hey make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door
yes hello uh this is howard wolowitz for colonel richard williams
oh i take it back don’t mention me
hi colonel williams how can i help you what oh uh yes he is from india no i don’t know his immigration status relax i’m still on hold speaking okay sure i can meet with you on thursday caltech is fine yeah and may i ask what this is about i may not
that’s what he said to me
i’m glad you decided to stay it’s gonna be special for penny and me to share this with you
i can’t wait for this day to be over
yeah special like that knock on door that’s them please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are
all right so less or equally awkward got it
so did you defile my mother or not
if i may i can assure you your mother and i did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation
did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold
look i promise you neither i nor anyone has ever said that
you don’t know his girlfriend very well
or what a joy it is to behold my genitals
all right you guys uh get settled in then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone
you know it’s hard to believe i’ve never met leonard
well he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor
i thought it was really funny
well fine if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems then i can too knock knock who’s there our family is an embarrassment
that’s not much of a joke
okay listen mom i know you’re nervous but i promise you no one is gonna judge you or this family
oh i’m sorry it’s just we’re meeting leonard’s parents for the first time and and they’re academics and and intellectuals and i don’t want them thinking we’re white trash
well what colour trash do you think they’ll believe
how could you think that i would spend the night with a man i just met
a man named jesus convinced you to build a church in africa you’re kind of a sucker
well nothing happened right it’s over until we get married a third time you guys will never have to see each other again
well you know actually that’s not the case mary may visit me in new york
mmhmm and he’s never been to texas
what in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia i can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway
you’re not seriously going to visit each other
oh please you’re just saying this to antagonize me
oh not at all mary happens to be a wonderful woman and if it antagonizes you that’s just a bonus
mary i’m sorry you’re in the middle of this
no no nothing to be sorry about i genuinely like your father
what but he’s a mediocre academic and according to beverley his sexual prowess is subpar he’s basically leonard with a bigger prostate
are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom
yes while also getting in a solid dig at you pretty efficient huh
this is ridiculous i’m going across the hall
but why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents
well i don’t want to stay here with her i’ll go
that still leaves me here with him
hang on hang on we’re smart we can figure this out okay so
great now i have to start all over
so how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you
pretty good i actually just got assigned a much better territory
see what happens when you work hard
hey she just sells drugs i had to make ’em
okay that’s enough no more drug talk for the rest of this trip
penny drinks more than i do
well i learned from the best
very nice wyatt and you wonder why this one turned out the way he did
you see what i’ve gotta put up with
what you’ve gotta put up with why did you have to go to jail
oh leonard it’s so nice to see you again
oh you too hey everyone this is my mother beverley
are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle
yes i am i’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble i’ve caused
you made god sad today mom
sheldon they haven’t done anything wrong i think it’s nice they’re hitting it off
well that’s still no reason to rush into anything i mean look at us we took things remarkably slow you and i we didn’t even hold hands for two years
it was a lot hotter than it sounds
hey hey she’s mine take a cold shower grandpa
why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about it has to be bad news
calm down okay try not to think about it
you know that hurts my feelings
calm down try not to think about it
why do i bother talking to you
oh come on what’s the worst that could come of this meeting
i don’t know they take the invention away and i get nothing
okay that’s not so bad you know what happened to the scientists that worked on the manhattan project the government forced them to move to the desert they had to live in secret and when oppenheimer objected to what they made him do they destroyed his reputation
what’s the point of that story
i just read a book about oppenheimer seemed like a chance to show off howard laughs there he is there’s my happy hebraic homeboy yeah that’s the smile i’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and i’m living with your wife
so what do you do for a living
mommy you want to take this one
it’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man i’m looking forward to meeting his father
and he can’t wait to meet you too can i get anyone a drink
well i could use another beer
hey is everyone getting to know each other
nice to see you again dr hofstadter i’m uh leonard’s friend stuart
oh oh hi uh i’m sorry did you two want to sit together
i was wondering why the front row was available
why do people cry at weddings
they’re practicing for what’s coming later
thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding
thank you for my new teeth
welcome to the family leonard don’t lend your new brotherinlaw money
we’re here today to celebrate love
sigh louder no one heard you
not just leonard and penny’s love but the love we have for them as well as each other
speaking of love stds among the elderly are skyrocketing
love is patient but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter so let’s knock it off
at least she’s yelling at someone else for a change
okay i understand everyone’s a little tense today so i am just gonna get to the important stuff leonard standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings like what a good idea it was to elope the first time but also how incredibly happy you make me thank you for marrying me hopefully for the last time
penny as a scientist my job is to figure out why things happen but i don’t think i’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you you know maybe i don’t
anybody have anything snarky to say about that didn’t think so
i’d like to say something beverly i know that we don’t bring out the best in each other
thank you all right let’s continue
yeah excuse me i need to say something to someone pretty special and i just can’t wait any longer
leonard you and i have our ups and downs but i have always considered you my family even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits i don’t always show it but you are of great importance to me both of you
okay i now pronounce you husband and wife and weird other husband who came with the apartment
thank you for taking us to the airport
hey i’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute
yeah me too beverly i’m sorry if i upset you
water under the bridge alfred leonard why don’t you get into the carpool lane
well that’s a solid line he can’t cross that
that’s okay i can make it over
no no let’s plod along it’ll make your father feel more comfortable
what makes me comfortable is knowing i don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face
do the world a favour and don’t wake up tomorrow morning
there’s a lot of traffic are we gonna be okay
you’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight
plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy
hey i will not have you be disrespectful to me
sheldon you’re mother’s an attractive woman you need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her
well and you need to drive the car and mind your business
i will not have you be disrespectful to me
don’t you be disrespectful to her
you’ll get there you’ve just gotta put some zing on it
penny i don’t know what i was worried about you’re friends are just lovely
although that sheldon is a bit peculiar
he reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain
look at this elon musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game
so some alien kid spent his money on the asthmaandglasses upgrade for me
well he doesn’t say it’s a good game
all right we got a problem
the air force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope they want to have a meeting
yeah this military guy showed up at howard’s door he was terrifying
he gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to howard
to a white guy born here no if you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it terrifying
you realize if the military declares our research classified they can take the whole thing away from us
and if that happens we’ll never be able to sell it commercially
i was counting on that money i need to make as much as my wife so i don’t have to try so hard in bed
oh yeah how do you think i stay this thin
gentlemen i think we are losing sight of the real issue we are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the militaryindustrial complex isn’t that exciting
not at all in star wars when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation harassing civilians didn’t you ever think hey that could be me
sheldon we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years
okay howard’s on board what do you think leonard
i’m worried about howard ever since that guy from the air force showed up he’s been a nervous wreck
all right we work at a giant pharmaceutical company get him some antianxiety meds
he won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a flintstone
you know when leonard’s feeling anxious i make him take a long walk
well for a while then he comes back
this guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant
no one at the office did did you tell anyone
no you told me not to
i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus she might have heard me throwing up one morning every since she got the hearing aid she thinks she’s so great
why don’t you want anyone to know
‘cause i’m up for a major immunotherapy study and if they find out i’m pregnant they might give it to someone else
i know they would they did it to barbara chen last year when i told everyone she was pregnant
wail till i snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project
are you crazy you can’t put that on snapchat
fine i’ll put it on facebook like a caveman
you know maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer
well you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer
why because i’m jewish that’s like me saying hey you’re indian doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre
my cousin does work in a call centre
we don’t need howard’s cousin no we have me
you’re not a lawyer sheldon you’re just a knowitall
i am not a knowitall i’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong
that’s the definition of being a knowitall
how did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy
i had a plan i kept leaving dove bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain
where did you get empty dove bar wrappers
from all the dove bars i ate i’m pregnant try to keep up i’m sorry i have to go find out if my boss knows
well whatever happens we’re here for you
thanks you guys are the best
yeah drive safe we love you and give us a call… oh my god it was me it was me i’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant
i didn’t mean to it just slipped out in front of her assistantone day i…
oh here’s your coat honey that’s such a cute jacket oh god i feel so bad i just lied to her
oh but you did it so well that’s amazing it’s like watching a sculptor but your clay was lies
is that really what’s important right now
i mean seriously you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so i can see what lights up
that’s super helpful amy thanks a lot i can’t wait to do that
i can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here
give me a second to call my cousin
i don’t see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property
first of all he’s in boca raton which is better than fort lauderdale but more importantly he lasted two days on jeopardy so he’s clearly a smart guy
hey marty thanks for talking to us
hey no problem thanks for going to outer space so no matter what i do my mom will be disappointed in me
well i married a little catholic girl so we’re even anyway this is leonard and sheldon the three of us came up with the guidance system
and this is my friend raj
oh i’m not on the patent i’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office
anyway like i said in the email this meeting’s on thursday do you have any advice for us
well i don’t know much about patent law but uh my advice is hear them out offer as little information as possible and whatever you do don’t sign anything
don’t sign anything that’s your advice okay so uh if during this meeting one of us were to say complete an oil painting you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned
this must be how you practice law in boca raton by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say
howard why is he yelling at me
all right you were on jeopardy allow me to alex trebek this and put it in the form of a question
marty let me call you back
someday when i’m up on murder charges you’ll be hearing from me
you don’t need him i’ll represent you
oh had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill
in like two minutes yeah so how is everything going around here are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant
sure sure uh did you ever figure out who told
no i confronted barbara chen but she claimed she didn’t know what i was talking about
hmm well i guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery you know like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights
it had to be barbara i’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her do you think using her work computer to google how to be a prostitute is over the line
uh you know when i was in high school there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back so me and all my friends we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her
what kind of revenge is that this woman screwed with my job she’s got to pay
okay all right honey you know what there was something i was too scared to tell you yesterday and now i’m just ballsout terrified to tell you but the truth is it wasn’t barbara chen it was me i’m the reason everyone knows
well it was an accidenti am so sorry i lied
oh you know i also lied about the girl in the bathroom yeah we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth
i don’t understand why i can’t talk at this meeting
‘cause when you talk it enrages people
okay quick question am i allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel
am i allowed to inform him that colonel sanders was never actually in the military
fine ooh can i use texttospeech software
gentlemen i’m colonel williams thank you for meeting with me
so which one of you is the brains behind all this
it’s a group effort but i guess if we had to pick a main brain it would be me
and because of the quantum vortices this can run perpetually
exactly yeah you have a good grasp of the physics
well i’m a scientist by training
where did you go to school
i should have known behind every great invention is an mit mind i’ll cut to the chase the air force believes there’s an application for this technology and we’re interested in funding your research
well thanks but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons
oh well let me put your mind at ease what we use it for is none of your business
i don’t know how i feel about this
look guys it’s just a guidance system it’s not like you’re handing us the death star from star trek all you need to worry about is right now it’s this big and we need it to be this big
yes it’s this much less big
i’m not even sure that’s possible
well i ran it by some colleagues at mit and they thought they could get it done in four months
yeah we’ll do it in two hi i’m dr sheldon cooper i’m the actual brains behind this project also engineers aren’t real scientists mit’s a trade school and the death star is from star wars not star trek but otherwise thank you for your service
hi howard told me you were working late so i brought dinner
oh thanks you know i just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes
i spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax
did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat
well i came to see how you were feeling but i’m guessing still angry
i’m sorry my boss wants to meet with me and i’m stressing
you really think they’re gonna start treating you differently
are you kidding i’ve always been treated differently look at me listen to me i mean the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist it’s i wonder if her mommy
i am really regretting that i got you a happy meal
i’ve worked so hard to get where i am and i don’t want to get sent back to square one because i’m pregnant
i wish there were some way i could make it better
well you brought me french fries that’s a start
uh actually i got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant
apple slices what kind of lunatic goes to mcdonald’s and gets fruit
oh leonard’s mad at me so i’m making him lemon bars
does he even like lemon bars
not really but i’m mad at him too so lemon bars it is
they made me promise i wouldn’t talk
well now see you knew what was gonna happen why didn’t they anyway now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame and everyone’s upset with me
well if it makes you feel any better bernadette’s mad at me too
mm if it makes you feel any better a parasitoid wasp known as oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction
why would that make me feel better
why would your bernadette thing make me feel better at least mine was educational
look i’m sorry tell me why bernadette is upset with you
well i told people at work that she’s pregnant she wasn’t ready for them to know
well it just slipped out i feel terrible
see that’s exactly what happened to me except that i said it on purpose and i have no regrets
is it even possible to get this done in two months
well maybe i don’t know we’ll have to work 12 hours a day seven days a week
which means i won’t be able to make penny breakfast every day and she’ll realize my brioche french toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage
so why did you guys even agree to the deadline
well the colonel said it was for the good of the country and the funding is substantial
no but mostly there was an awkward pause and i broke it by saying okay
so i guess i won’t be seeing you guys for a while
wow you’re going off to work with the military leaving me behind now i know how all those army wives feel
would you stop we’re just gonna be on the other side of campus
you are a deeply silly man
he is so afraid of his feelings
i just wanted to apologize i know what you did was an accident
oh thank you and i’m sorry i lied about it
for what it’s worth you’re a great liar
oh that’s what amy said so what’s going on with the research project are they gonna let you run it
well my boss said he hadn’t decided yet so i gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy and i’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury
hey i learned a long time ago when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch that’s where you punch
that’s funny i learned something totally different
do you know what it’s just a research project the most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child it’s all i need to give my life meaning
you believe me oh good 11 more chumps like you i’ll have the jury eating out of my hand
i never realized this building was classified
wish we weren’t so far from my parking space
the way you put away those lemon bars perhaps that’s a good thing
i’d like to reinstate the younottalking rule
i didn’t even have to take my glasses off
oh oh oh oh guys hold me upside down
it’s pretty late you think i’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system
sure i’m still figuring out the thermoacoustic expander
oh while you do that i am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic byproducts of the day’s thoughts
it’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime nightynight y’all
hey hey hey you’re not going anywhere
we only have two months to deliver this to the air force because of you
well wake up we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights
well i don’t know midnight one
one o’clock i’m not a raccoon
if you’re tired have some coffee
and look how irritable it’s making you
guys we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting now can you please try
fine time passing montage i don’t think i can go much longer
it’s been three and a half minutes wake up
i had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work
oh i had a good dream that when i carried you to bed i let your head hit the wall and i laughed
well we didn’t see you last night we’re not gonna see you today so we thought we could have breakfast together
so what are you guys gonna do today
well sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon but i don’t think that’s happening
oh i’ll go i like a party
well to be honest it’s not like a party party it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields i don’t know why i called it a party sorry
you don’t think you’ll be bored
oh i’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap i don’t understand i mean how is it any different than every single day of my life
sorry i have to work all weekend
well i didn’t get to see you last night it was the least i could do
you shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday
so what should we do today
oh i appreciate it but you don’t have to spend your day off with me
well i don’t mind oh you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff
oh come on we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies
i get enough of that when i take howard to my grandmother’s for christmas
oh i know why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room
isn’t it a little early for that
you have to get to it eventually
oh there’s so much junk in there it’s embarrassing
how can you be embarrassed around me i’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth
you didn’t think i was gonna be in your kitchen this morning yet here i am
you look tired why don’t you have an energy drink everyone’s doing it
oh no thank you those have caffeine in them
oh sorry i thought you were cool
i am cool this is yoohoo chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin
all right but if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers try one of these
you bet you know why hulk is so strong steroids you know why batman wanders around at night getting into fights scotch
i am facing a great deal of work and i do like things better when famous people also like them
the first one’s free flash how do you stay in business
you want to know my secret i bought stock in marvel
hi bert this is my friend penny
hey come on in i’ll gonna go turn on some rock music that’s a geology joke
oh actually we’re an hour late
i suddenly wish sheldon was here
i don’t even know where to begin
well in the sound of music julie andrews says let’s start at the very beginning a very good place to start
oh i was gonna start at the end thank god you’re here
well i think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone
sorry i should probably keep this in case we have a girl
oh that’s a nice one was it yours when you were little
my dad built it for me
this was the husband and this was the wife they’d go out on adventures together cruises skiing horseback riding that was really me just duct taping them to our dog
oh and did they have kids
they did but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them so they shipped them off to an orphanage i made out of a shoebox
yeah that’s not worrisome at all
not every girl dreams about being a mom sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant and it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog
i skipped spin class for this
why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine
oh it’s complicated he finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine
gentlemen i am ready to work to quote the martian let’s science the faeces out of this that’s the martian the book and the martian the movie not marvin the martian although to quote marvin the martian i claim this planet in the name of mars
oh i’m fantastic never been better i had my first energy drink and i feel great hey you guys want to wrestle we can do arm thumb mud sumo nah we’re not fat enough or wearing diapers
so should we talk to each other or mingle
i don’t know where everyone is
yeah i mean i could see him eating one or two guests but not a whole party
well i guess this is kind of a bust you don’t have to stay i’m gonna start cleaning up
okay i feel so bad about leaving him here
oh it’s funny i was just thinking the same thing about you
hey listen could you not say anything about this to the people at the university you know ’cause you’re you and i’m me and it’s kind of embarrassing
wait what do you mean she’s her
well you know how amy’s the coolest girl on campus right
what you tell me about your foot fungus but this is a secret
i’m sure it’s just ’cause i’m dating sheldon
mm actually i think sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you
now sheldon’s popular what is happening
maybe we should break for lunch what time is it
according to the world’s worst cuckoo clock it’s two
my head hurts and i’m more tired than ever
why don’t you just go home
no i can do this i just i just need another energy drink oh no
that’s a craving that’s a sign of chemical dependency
no i know but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure i mean crack cocaine nicotine pringles you know once one pops one just can’t stop
you can’t develop a problem that fast
you want to bet oh great now i’m addicted to gambling
we can’t afford to lose any more time
well this probably won’t work but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him
that’s not helpful it’s fun to think about but it’s not helpful hey sheldon we are on a serious time crunch we can’t do this without you can you please pull it together
just please bear with me if i display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal
sorry i flipped out on you i think it’s just hormones
i think you were mean before you were pregnant but it’s fine so uh instead of cleaning out the room why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery
of course it does didn’t your baby room have a theme
well it doubled as my dad’s office and he was a cop so i guess the theme was bloody homicide photos
oh mine was winnie the pooh but anyway why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour right there are so many amazing ones red blue green purple
are you just gonna name all the colours
i don’t care what colour the room is
okay well i’m just trying to help you
well you’re not so just drop it off i’m clearly upset why aren’t you following me
and when amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment all of a sudden everybody was doing it
just the right idea at the right time
okay okay so amy’s cool sheldon’s cool tell me about leonard
oh him i guess he’s all right apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him
that’s me i’m her you know he didn’t trick me he just wore me down
it makes sense you two are friends i mean hot girls always stick together
and you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party
you know i had no idea caltech is exactly like my high school
well it’s not exactly like it we’re all extremely smart
wow you popular girls are mean
i’m gonna get some coffee you want some
uh you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when i’m trying to get my life back on track
uh okay let’s pretend you do have a problem
no you don’t but let’s say you do and don’t say you do because you don’t now wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it
i thought i didn’t have a problem
okay how thelma and louise of us
raj why don’t i care about anything
it’s my baby i i should care about nurseries and colours and i don’t what’s wrong with me
well crimescene photos near your crib spring to mind
i keep waiting to feel excited but it’s not happening what if it never happens
bernadette come on look you’re overthinking this okay you’re gonna be an amazing mom even if you don’t believe it i know you have maternal instincts
once i was supposed to babysit my brothers our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets
happy and wellfed you see that’s what i’m taking from that story
leonard can i ask you a question
is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem
howard can i ask you a question
all right i’ll just toss this out to the room um i was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps now i couldn’t find a caffeine patch but i did find what claims to be a mindboosting caffeine suppository you know the interesting fact about the rectum…
sheldon we are dealing with an impossible deadline from the air force because of you so have an energy drink don’t have an energy drink order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want i don’t care
you don’t shove them they come with an easyglide applicator
right listen to me we can’t do anything until you do your part so get up in front of this whiteboard and do it
no i can’t figure out the math i’ve been racking my brain for days and i’ve got nothing
i can’t do it i’m not as smart as i think i am i’m so sorry this is all my fault
it’s okay we’ll figure something out
it’ll be fine you’ll see sheldon buddy sheldon snores
when the baby gets here you gotta teach me that
thank you so much bert this was great
my pleasure you girls want to take home a twogallon tub of potato salad
okay well thanks for coming by you’re nice people
well so are you in fact you know what we will never take you for granite did you get that granite a little geology joke
you need to leave i’m in love with both of you now
what why who are you calling you’re gonna rat me out to howard aren’t you you’re such a snitch no wonder i don’t like you
whoa i’m calling my dad okay he’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an obgyn and experience with crazy ladies because of my mom
hello rajesh are you calling to ask for money
are you calling to ask for things that cost money
this is my friend bernadette she’s pregnant and she’s a bit worried so i thought maybe you could talk to her
of course what seems to be the trouble
something’s wrong i don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into honestly i’m not even sure i like babies
look some people are baby people and some people are not baby people it doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby
but i thought i’d be more excited
oh being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him after he was born she doted on his every move and you know what happened he broke her heart moved halfway around the world and dates only poor white women so you never know
thank you i feel better now
good bernadette i hope you have a daughter
um i don’t really know how to say this
well you could try starting with sir
he said start with it not end with it
we’ve hit a bit of a snag we’re already behind schedule
the computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought
i understand that we’re under contract and i don’t know what the consequences of violating that are but uh we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised
that’s it you’re okay with that
what you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time we’re still waiting for a big space laser reagan ordered to beat the commies
and there was water everywhere it was such a mess
that stinks how long are you out of the apartment
ugh did you lose anything valuable
well the pipe was over my closet so all my clothes are gone
oh so nothing great do they know why the pipe burst
buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as i did and not pick up a few things about plumbing
well if you need a place to crash you can stay with us
of course you can stay in leonard’s room and we’ll stay at my place
you’re sure that’s not an inconvenience
and we live with sheldon so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning
so technically i’d be moving in with my boyfriend
i guess so and i’d finally get to live alone with my husband
oh my this is a big step
mmhmm for two of us it’s in the right direction
why are you all smiling like crazy people
cohabitation with my girlfriend that’s a great deal to process
yeah and we’ll be right across the hall
i don’t know what if living together kills the romance
okay you guys had sex one whole time nothing can put out a fire like that
yeah but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain i mean she’s never even seen me unshaven
you just shaved yesterday you’re good for three months
sheldon i understand your apprehension but let me appeal to the scientist in you given the fiveweek end date isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility
don’t try luring me in with sexy talk
okay star trek the original series the enterprise was on a fiveyear mission to explore new worlds think of this as your personal fiveweek mission to do the same
if you want to lure me in with sexy talk that’s how you do it
not yet how will i learn if i’m comfortable living with amy or just comfortable because i’m in my own apartment now if this experiment is going to be valid i suggest a neutral environment
well ideally an enclosed selfsustaining biodome in new mexico where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste
and you were worried about the romance 00
wait why don’t you guys stay across the hall and we will live here
interesting if my official residence were across the hall i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here
that’s a good question maybe just don’t come over
historically i don’t do well with change
okay it won’t be that bad we wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone
you’re darn right you wouldn’t no matter where i am this will always be my spot like an embassy in a foreign country this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom
just nod and smile he’s almost gone
yes i accept this fiveweek mission to share a living space with my girlfriend
well now don’t be surprised if like star trek it’s cancelled in three
i have to say i am happy with your obgyn
cool ‘cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment
i’m the son of a gynaecologist i could be helpful
it would help if you stopped telling me i have a textbook cervix
the polite response is thank you for noticing
let me see the sonogram again oh yeah that’s a goodlooking baby for a little grey blob
yeah we could name him blobert
bloberta or blobbi with an i
are we being silly not finding out the sex
yeah i was just thinking the same thing
if you want you can find out right now
hmm the doctor’s gone for the day so it doesn’t matter
well somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder
it was an accident the doctor left the folder out on her desk it’s not my fault i opened it and looked
so you know the sex of our baby and we don’t
flip a coin you got a fiftyfifty shot
what this is not a problem okay if you don’t want to know i don’t have to tell you
we don’t want you to know
you know i’m very proud of you for trying to live with amy
of course the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys one pair that was neither dating nor living together one pair that was dating but not living together one pair that was living together but not dating and then of course one pair that was living together and dating although with that many sheldons it’d be such a party we’d never get anything done
that was a cute story so um what did you want to ask me
well you’ve lived with your significant other for some time i would like this experiment to go well are there any insights you can share
mm well the biggie is if she has an insane roommate kick him out as soon as possible
you know leonard and i were very happy before you came along
you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever do you have any advice
i’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this
i know it sounds like a cliché but compromise is key
never leave a belt on the floor at night they look like snakes
do little things like bring her a cup of coffee in bed
keep mm’s in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line
you’re gonna be seeing each other a lot so respect each other’s personal space
he startles easily so please no flash photography
how many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move
i don’t know i didn’t count
you truly are the goofus to my gallant
that’s me listen you and i are gonna be sharing a bed you know this is uncharted territory for both of us how are you feeling about that
oh excited concerned a little scared all the same emotions i feel in line at space mountain
well if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements maybe we should talk about it
well i imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations
wow no foreplay or anything just right to it
look i know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone so why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on once we’re more settled in we can revisit it
i’ve never lived with someone either this is a lot for me too
this is such a relief honestly if it didn’t get you all worked up i’d kiss you right now
good call seeing your teen titans underwear really got my motor running
i know they probably shouldn’t sell those to children
enjoy having the place to yourselves
you enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before
it’s penny’s bedroom plenty of men have gone before
now now there’s no need to make this emotional
you too oh don’t forget tuesday the air filters need to be changed
yeah you wrote it on my hand
oh oh and every other day check the water level on the avocado pit
i’m on it 15 years from now we’ll make guacamole together
well that’s it for the next five weeks we are officially living together
which side of the bed would you prefer
doesn’t matter to me your choice
no no we’re living together now everything’s equal you know i know that i have a tendency to be controlling so i would rather you choose
well sheldon i really appreciate that but these things mean more to you than they do to me so whatever you want
well clearly it’s not whatever i want because what i want is for you to make this decision and you refuse to do that
well i’m not refusing i’m just trying to be considerate
like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom and then watched me roll right into traffic
sheldon will you please just pick a side
fine okay now on this side i am closer to the exit in case of emergency
no but i’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack
ah then again what are the odds of someone attacking me
now this side offers me proximity to the bathroom but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep
okay what if we do this
although now i’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes
this is ridiculous the doctor knows what the baby is the ultrasound tech knows raj knows his grey’s anatomy online fan group probably knows is it weird we don’t
i don’t know maybe the surprise will make it more fun like magic tricks remember how disappointed you were when i explained the neverending hanky
i was disappointed to see the man i was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly
but how delightful was it when i pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves it’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you
everyone said i could do better
but you didn’t listen and presto changeo my baby’s inside you tada
ugh what is that entering why did you switch sides
be grateful i’m still in the room
oh i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers
sheldon i know we took coitus off the table but i was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy such as snuggling
well it’s funny you should ask because i was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall
sheldon i’ve made more than enough accommodations for you we’re both grown adults we’ve been far more intimate than this if you don’t want to snuggle fine but we’re not building a pillow wall
okay well i am sorry i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night and no offence but your bottom radiates enough heat i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it
that’s it it’s sheldon’s bedtime he is in for the night
wow i cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment
it’s weird this must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college unless they feel sad then it’s different
so what do you want to do
i know exactly what we are gonna do
really you’re a genius and that’s the first thing you come up with
hey sheldon’s not here so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear
ugh can we just have sex
oh don’t worry once you see my sweet moves sex is inevitable
i’ll just let my hips do the talkin’
screw it i’m calling and finding out
good call him wait i’m not sure i want to know
but you just said you wanted to know
well now i don’t know if i want to know
no dr feynman if i solve it for you you’ll never learn
wow where did you learn these moves
the world may have forgotten about dance dance revolution but not this smooth criminal
okay you’re positive you want to know
okay here we go it’s ringing
i told you not to do the worm
i changed my mind hang up hang up
what are you doing down there
i’m so sore i don’t think i slept two minutes last night
i feel like i pulled something why didn’t you tell me to stop
even more not what you think
i don’t know if i can make it through five weeks living with him
if you ever need a break the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee
good morning see i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine so how is everyone
well i didn’t and it’s your fault
how you had the whole floor to yourself
sheldon maybe living together is a bad idea
well but what kind of scientists would we be drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data
the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night
wow i anticipated we’d have problems but i never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them
i’m sorry are you questioning my integrity as a scientist
if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits
what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway i mean you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time and you don’t even get that joke ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables
oh you heard me your experimental bona fides are laughable
whoa whoa now you’re making fun of my bona fides
can’t make fun of something that’s a null set
i feel like i should say damn
well if you are so protective of the scientific method perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started
well for science maybe i will
do you want to go to our place and make out
does stephen hawking roll through the quad
okay i’m confused which one is mr robot
i’ll give you a hint we’re watching daredevil
will you two please inform amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule
i told you you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives
i can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate
i’m sorry for bringing this over here
believe me we know what you’re going through
and i think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies
sheldon i understand that you like things a certain way and i’m willing to make some concessions but you have to be open to compromise
oh look who’s in favour of compromise the woman who married leonard hofstadter
hey she didn’t compromise she settled there’s a difference
what time do you and bernadette head out
as soon as i get home we’re hoping to make it before dark
i’ve never been to palm springs
oh you should go it’s terrific i really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90
i don’t know if i want to watch old people sweat i can just facetime my family in india
it’s nice you and bernadette are getting away
well she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes
so then what are you doing here buying comic books
well he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes
when you live with someone there’s gonna be conflict you just have to keep communicating
okay well for starters there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder
sheldon what do you say to that
i think we should see other people
well as a male i have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my dna restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature
we sleep together once a year you want other partners
don’t blame me blame your pal biology he’s the pervert pulling the strings here
you wanna see other people go see other people
i hope one of those people is a monkey ’cause this is bananas
hey you can make jokes but if this keeps up he’s gonna move back in here
all right well let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down
good then before we reintroduce them we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again
so it’s okay for you to joke around
no that’s actually what we did with him when howard came back from space
honey how ya feeling sound of bernadette vomiting violently the book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away more vomiting so that’s good news right
the only thing i hate more than you right now is that book
there she is who’s ready for a hot threehour car ride to the desert
next vomit is gonna be in your lap
i’m sorry we don’t have to go
but it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us
how ’bout we stay here we don’t even have to tell anyone it’ll be like a secret vacation at home
keeping secrets from our friends it does sound kinda fun
you just heard me throwing up
you know what’s weird how turned on you are right now
you know people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with but the truth is amy is just as challenging
when we’re sleeping she breathes on me one night it got so bad i almost grabbed toto
leonard breathes on me too it’s not a big deal
she’s always complaining about people at work
well so does leonard it’s kind of annoying but it’s not the end of the world
do you know that when i get out of the shower she eyes me up and down like i’m a piece of meat
you know so does leonard can’t i just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbsup heyheyhey
i know sometimes i would just like to be appreciated for my mind
well pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do in fact what’s this between your toes
can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes was that the front door
it sounded like it oh my god someone’s in the house
lock the door lock the door
uh i left my phone downstairs
what are we gonna do email 911
you know i rely on humour in times of stress
let me know when you start because that wasn’t funny
who would use our hot tub
well the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think
stuart he heard me talking about us going away i guess he decided to invite himself over
should we say something to him
maybe how ’bout hey you look like a boiled chicken breast
i meant like what are you doing here
nah that’s not gonna hurt his feelings
why is nothing easy with him
look here’s the thing you need to understand about sheldon he’s the worst
i prefer to think of it as highmaintenance
i prefer to think of myself as fiveten but i still need to get all my pants hemmed
i guess i should have known what i was getting myself into
don’t beat yourself up you’ve never lived with anyone before
and you’re starting out with sheldon cooper that’s like getting your first pet and having it be i don’t know what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life
you’re not making me feel better
look even when penny and i started living together there was a learning curve but i promise you it does get easier
he put a sign up in the bathroom that says number of days without amy’s hair on the soap
is it me or is there something fun about watching him just float there
maybe this is why people get fish tanks who just turned the porch lights on
hmm they must have left the tub on good thing i stopped by ah aaaaah what are you doing here
maybe howard and bernadette said i could be here
answer the question what are you doing here
i had nothing else to do tonight the last couple of months i come here when i know they’re not home
they heard me in the bushes once but they thought i was a raccoon
i told you raccoons don’t say uhoh
you know one night leonard’s nose whistled so loud i swear it was like sleeping on a train track
have you noticed it’s always an aflat
is it oh it’s like his sinuses are right here in the car
if we’re just going to drive around aimlessly the least you could do is take me for ice cream
yeah i’ll take you for ice cream
well see why can’t amy be that subservient she has coitus one time suddenly she’s gloria steinem anyway i suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women
oh please you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person why would you want to confuse and disappoint others
being with amy has awoken the sexual creature within when i see a pretty gal walking down the street i think hubba hubba like any other guy
you kiss your mother with that mouth ‘cause it’s fine
to howard and bernadette and the house key they never asked me to return
you said you got it back
so why don’t you get it fixed
i called and they’re like pay your bill
if you ever need somewhere to crash there’s always my place
oh no i don’t want to be an inconvenience you’ve got all your lady friends and…
it’s okay it’s by choice well their choice and it’s not okay
nobody does i was embarrassed so i didn’t say anything
why wouldn’t he tell us are we bad friends
he’s in our hot tub drinking our wine
yeah he deserves to be alone
so you’re back out on the dating scene now
oh that must be fun how’s that going
i’m in a hot tub with you so pretty bad
maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule
exactly learn from my mistakes no matter where i am at 7
it’s just so much easier to give him what he wants
oh true but think of how much you’ve accomplished who got him to stop purelling his pocket change
and who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment
and who got him to try a turkey dog
that was actually koothrappali but i did let him spit it out in my hand
how can you stop now that’s like walking out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy
you know you’re right i’m in this relationship too i need to stand up for myself
and if he doesn’t like it he can move back here
oh he can try he’d just need a good locksmith
well who you gonna hit on the girl in front of us got strawberry that’s your favourite
no no if we both like it i’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going aw no strawberry
what about the girl behind the counter
hmm well she spends her whole day scooping one arm’s probably bigger than the other
is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone
i’d say wise beyond your years but you’re getting up there
all right come on what is really going on with you
penny i am going to tell you a story that i’ve never told anyone
i was 13 years old and on spring break from college
i came home early because they ran out of math to teach me
oh now i’m with ya okay
my mother was at bible study i walked in the house expecting to find it empty and i heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom when i opened the door i saw my father having relations with another woman
i know it’s also why i never open a door without knocking three times i mean the first
well what happened with your dad
we locked eyes i ran to my room and we never ever spoke of it
since amy and i have been living together we’ve been bickering like my parents used to
and you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did
yes i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road
down the road sheldon she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women
well anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone
honey instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now
i’m sure you’re right i suppose i should apologize to you as well
that must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you please understand that i think of you as more of a nanny
just finish your ice cream so i can get you home to bed
i wonder if this is what it feels like to be bernadette’s baby
i don’t know bernadette’s baby doesn’t have a jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot
those jets are for my secret spot not his
what do you do in there
it’s called relaxing and that’s all you need to know
well it’s getting late maybe we should head home
yeah just give me a minute
well you know how you’re wearing a bathing suit
i kind of went the other way
you jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub
it’s a nice enough spot you know if i’m going to start standing up for myself this is exactly the kind of thing…
we’re doing good i think sheldon has something he would like to say to amy
i wanted to apologize for my behaviour today it it was unnecessary this is warm oh and also i am willing to forego the bathroom schedule
why does she get that we never got that
amy you should know i was never really interested in seeing other women and to prove how serious i am about us i’m willing to take our relationship to the next level
amy farrah fowler will you share this toothbrush holder with me
did we really need to be here for this
call me crazy but i found it moving
hey have you ever heard of the van nuys comiccon
‭yeah it’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad dlist celebrities to appear why
i got asked to sign autographs there
that’s awesome is this for serial apeist
well it could be for the monkey movie it could be my haemorrhoid commercial the list does not go on
it doesn’t matter i’m not doing it
you just said yourself it’s sad
yeah but it’s not pathetic that’s where i draw the line come on we’ll have fun
you’ll have nerds fawning all over you if you don’t love that this marriage is in trouble
i guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money
yeah wow an appearance by george lucas… ‘s dermatologist oh i want that autograph
you know with us living together maybe we could think about having people over
we have people over all the time we have the maintenance people the pizza delivery man that ups driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging
all right fine let’s say that we were to entertain people what type of gathering did you have in mind huh a meal lunch brunch dinner afternoon tea a formal tea hmm is it a party and if so what kind of party is it a cocktail party a tupperware party ooh is it a surprise party oh i hope it’s not a west coast party ’cause according to the man on the radio a west coast party don’t stop
oh don’t be you get your hopes up i knock them down that’s called teamwork
that’s a kick that’s an actual kick
i felt a kick there’s a baby in there
oh yeah that’s where i put it
oh i mean i know you’re pregnant i just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby
which mit did you go to
oh god we are not ready to have an infant in this house we don’t have a crib we don’t have diapers we’re not babyproofed anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids
howie we have time to do all that stuff
do we look at you willy wonka would roll you to the juicing room
the next person kicking you will be me good night
are we even in a good school… ow
i warned you and i did it
oh everything we need for your autograph session head shots markers
okay leonard it’s sweet you’re excited about this but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph
are you kidding i once paid twenty dollars for theo sassler’s signature
oh i don’t even know i just liked his name theo sassler okay and look at this i even got a change maker how much change you want little lady
oh there’s so much i want to change
yeah well if it’s a dollar you’re in luck
you expressed an interest in having people over and i feel i dismissed it too quickly so i took matters into my own hands and i arranged a brunch
well that’s so nice who’s coming
oh uh stuart bert from the geology lab and mrs petrescu from downstairs
you mean the romanian lady on the second floor
yes oh fun story she grew up with ten siblings or possibly penguins her english is atrocious
that’s an odd mix of people
well for our first time hosting i thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run you know like how i practiced for that halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station
you never went into that haunted house
you never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station
well thank you sheldon this is a fun surprise
oh well the real surprise is how surprised you are that i’m great at surprises
well that’s not a surprise at all i mean if i knew you were good at surprises i would have
don’t get me all randy guests are on the way
oh we went and did a little shopping for the baby
wait till you see the crib we found
you bought a crib without me
yeah it’s the highest rated one on the market i wouldn’t even call it a crib i’d call it a fortress of solitude for babies
okay well i may have gone a bit overboard but you can’t put a price on safety
though if you did it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting
but it’s the safest crib you can buy and if you don’t like it we can return it
in our new minivan hey what’s for lunch
it’s for the baby and i didn’t buy it the dealer loaned it to me for a 24hour test drive
though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib so you might have bought a minivan
i don’t want to drive that it’s such a mom car
the guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore
then again he did think you were my husband
they thought it at the ultrasound why not at the car dealership
never been on this side of the table before i feel powerful
really i feel like i’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms
okay so it’s four seventyfive for a signed blackandwhite and nine ninetyfive for a colour
alright why not five and ten bucks
well i brought my moneymaker let me shake it
hey that guy’s looking over here
oh you think he’s your first autograph
i don’t know be cool he’s coming he’s coming hi
it has got to be one of the worst things i’ve ever seen in my life
okay who do i make it out to
that did not clear things up
but iii oh nothing about that was good
there’s nothing to be afraid of sheldon
the average cork speed is 25 miles per hour if that is too fast around a school it is certainly too fast around a kitchen
okay i can do this just give me a moment… oh mimosas coming up
i once left orange juice in my fridge so long it tasted like a mimosa
it’s hard to say i don’t remember much after i drank it
would you like one mrs petrescu
yes drink is fun and good friends applebee’s
tv good now back to you
stuart this is bert from the caltech geology lab and this is mrs petrescu from downstairs
eh we watched sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes
15 minutes can save you 15 or more on car insurance
anybody else coming to this thing
my favourite part is your shower scene
been hearing that a lot today
i even have a screen grab on my phone
well go ahead he’s right over there
why do you do that can’t you let me have my moment
i assume we’re still talking about the movies but after today who knows
you think i could get a picture of us
and uh could you be giving me a kiss
no she cannot kiss what is wrong with you people
no no no it’s not okay
it’s got a rearview camera there’s a dvd player oh and check this out it’s like we’re living in the future
hey show her the trunk show her the trunk
imagine this you’ve got the baby in one hand groceries in the other and you’re thinking how am i gonna open this trunk
i’m probably thinking where’s my husband and why isn’t he helping me
you don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot
no it’s a gentle kick you’re doing it wrong here give me those
uh maybe it was more of a circle
it’s weird that guy thought you were a couple
see easy and look at all this cargo space now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a testdrive i’m telling you this van is gonna be… uuhuuh uuhuuh
oh yeah oh anyway let’s just get in and see if the gps can take us to the nearest emergency room
so until amy’s apartment is fixed she and i are living here together
i lived with my old girlfriend she was a geologist too
i came home from work one day and she had taken everything i’m warning you hide your good rocks
my sister’s husband took all her things too story at eleven
really no one else is coming
this is it you are the practice round
uh no he he just means that you were the first people we thought of
you know exactly we’ve never thrown a brunch before and i wanted to work out all the kinks
so i’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over
hmm you see your words sound reasonable but your face looks angry help me out here this is not where i shine
stuart you know you’re one of our favourite people
okay now see you look sincere but your words are completely false i’m glad we did this test run these brunches are wild
but how did you get her to go out with you
well she moved in across the hall
and he started to slowly wear me down
like a river carves a canyon
yeah except the river kept showing me his pokémon cards
hang on this guy’s telling me how he got the serial apeist girl to marry him
this guy but he’s wearing a change maker
that’s right i’m her change daddy
aaaaah what was i thinking wolowitzes are not a lifting people we tip the lifting people
do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room they’re just gonna give you ice and advil like last time
you’re gonna feel terrible when i’m in a wheelchair which by the way would fit easily in the back of this awardwinning minivan
fine we’ll go to the er just stop selling me on the van
you have to admit it’s a pretty smooth ride
i was hoping it’d be quieter
if childbirth is half this bad you are so screwed are we there yet
why is it taking so long
howard howard look at the dvd screen i put on batman
i’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh this is a good one
i’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have
fine i’ll buy the stupid van
this is the best blintz i’ve ever had
it almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier
you know what i i i think i’m just gonna go
no i consider you and sheldon like my family and i’m not even sure you think of me as a friend you have any idea how that feels
i’m always the last one anybody thinks of
well no that’s not true i mean sometimes it’s koothrappali but we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority
stuart wait i do know what it feels like to be left out
i know how it feels too
all right this is about me and him you’re not part of it stuart perhaps we do take you for granted and that is not acceptable please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group
you know in fact i’d like to propose a toast to stuart a fine man a good friend and a wonderful guest
cheers filmed before a live studio audience
and that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox
oh whoa i didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times
the third time i did it in skywriting but she never looked up
you know once i proposed to him
i just wanted to make her work for it
yeah that’s gonna cost you later
hang on is she just with you because you’re rich
she makes more money than i do
do you know what else i love about you
no i mean it i mean it it’s like you have the soul of a label maker
you know what i love about you
you never leave the house without a paper clip
you never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner
i also love how you never use swear words
you know it turns out you can hurt people just as well without ’em
maybe i can get a little help putting some of this stuff away
oh calm down i already put away five of these you see no muss no fuss not a single cuss
and i’m dr amy farrah fowler
and welcome to the first on location episode of dr sheldon cooper and dr amy farrah fowler present…
dr sheldon cooper’s fun with flags
for joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner
what fills my heart and makes my eyes moist sending a flag up a pole on a hoist
fun with flags fun with flags
oh say can you see it’s fun with flags
as you may notice just one of the changes around here is our new house band
who haven’t learned their place yet
we’re also coming to you live from a different apartment
dr fowler and i began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged this is our friend penny’s place you may remember her from our episode flags and the people who don’t understand them
so in the spirit of cohabitation the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one such as the flag of st kitts and nevis
so let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know nevis drumroll well i i like that but next time check with me
did you know that the flag was designed by a student named edrice lewis…
i can’t believe i’m saying this but can we watch the news or something
it’s cute they’re having fun living together
yeah i wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready
actually it’s been ready for weeks
well they finished the work early but she’s been telling sheldon they’re behind schedule
so she’s just been lying to him
yeah but to make him leave not to make him stay
buda and pest united to form budapest and that’s why budapest is the budabest now
thank you for your services gentlemen now i’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music
aw you think you have an audience that’s funny
we don’t get paid nothing not even a sandwich
it’s almost dinner time you in the mood for anything
yeah we could get thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress
oh you don’t want do that it’s a construction zone
well what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks
i am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack
you know if you’d like i could call your landlord and complain
thanks but you don’t have to
oh i don’t mind i’m very good at complaining if it were an olympic sport i’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then i’d take home the gold
good stuff so uh what about dinner
is it me or are you purposely changing the subject
no and on the subject of subjects is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king
i have a feeling you’re still doing it but i find that topic irresistible so now in ancient mesopotamia the king referred to the people as his property
i’m serious jpl’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us
so their plan for saving the earth from armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball
if we’re all gonna die why am i eating so much kale
i’m concerned about amy she’s acting a bit odd lately
oh well just out of curiosity what registers as odd to you
her behaviour no i have the feeling that she’s hiding something
i wouldn’t worry about it she’s probably just distracted by work
well whatever it is it’s troubling me and i can’t eat i can’t sleep and don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements
you heard him guys don’t ask
why would she keep something from me you know i shared my body with that woman and my netflix password they recommended stella got her groove back because of her
buddy buddy listen nothing bad is going on she just she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago
she’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early
so she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me
oh well i feel both flattered and hurt like when people say i look like that skeleton from nightmare before christmas
oh my god that’s who you look like
sheldon this is not a big deal it’s a little white lie everyone does it
not me i’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships
and how single are you right now
eating cake on the toilet single
well i won’t tolerate deception in my relationship i have no choice but to confront her
don’t do that you’ve got gold here hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face
why would you tell him that that’s terrible advice
so you wouldn’t want to have anything on penny
so if i actually know something right now and i do you don’t want me to tell you
i’ll take that as a yes she’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed
see i’ve known that for weeks but you know i waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain
i’d say damn it in klingon but that wasn’t until next month
khoovakh she took my where’s waldo
so what’s the deal with your apartment why’s it taking so long
um it was a drywall problem
well the drywall got wet and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet it’s really more…
or damp wall just as bad
mm so why don’t they just get more drywall
well they went to get some but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…
okay are you done bernadette told me your apartment’s ready
i was done at wet wall but you wouldn’t let it go
but is sheldon really believing all this crap
well he started to question it but then i fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower please don’t say anything i feel terrible about this
the woman at the wall store
are you going to confront penny
eventually i guess although i am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing
hmm you know perhaps instead of confronting them we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs like that spiderman action figure that used to be on your desk
oh my god i’m going blind
excellent i’m very hungry speaking of which what’s going on with your apartment
oh uh they’re still working on it
yeah we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while
wait uh you saw her apartment
jlyajbe’ dah nep’a’ penny i don’t understand is penny lying
this is ridiculous penny do you remember when i taught you ubbi dubbi
ubexcubellent duboes shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing
ubif lubenubard tubold hubim ubit’s pubossubibuble
okay that’s enough you know what what is going on
fine i told sheldon that her apartment’s been finished but then you just said it’s not so now i’m all confused
penny was just covering for me my place has been ready for two weeks
how could you lie to me
uh she’s enjoyed living with you it’s called being in love
mmhmm and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff
what tha… that is not true
bernadette told howard howard told me plus i can see all my stuff is gone
oh so you believe your friend and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me wow
you really didn’t think i’d notice my stuff was missing
uh did you notice your key chain
why did you tell howard i was hiding leonard’s things
one sec why did you tell leonard i told you penny was hiding his things
it just came up because we we were talking about secrets and… wait juh qachhom dotlh sov ‘iv who knows the status of amy’s apartment
i’m not really a part of this so i’m just gonna dig in
and i’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment
amy i’m sorry i shouldn’t have said anything
i guess it’s okay i’m sorry that i lied about my apartment
and what your wizard robes are next to go
now that everything’s out on the table you you think you two will keep living together
despite recent events i do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive
are you saying you’d like to live with me
you know if he moves across the hall for good leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in sheldon’s old room solves everything
ooh maybe i could turn it into a gaming den
wuh wuh hold on excuse me that’s my room
but you won’t be living here
but you won’t be living here
you guys might want to start eating but you won’t be living here
sweetie once you stop paying rent none of this is really yours
but you won’t be living here
hey i get it everybody wants to spend more time with me i’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants
night if we did continue living together would it be here
i don’t know it it could be
of course there’s there’s always your apartment
sure sure we we could live in my apartment
well i suppose we could find a whole new place you know and technically we don’t even have to stay in pasadena we could we could move to altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena
it’s kind of exciting i mean we could do whatever we want
but what if we move and we don’t like it what if there’s a smoker in the building or pets or there could be mould there could be traffic noise i’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route are you trying to soothe me by singing the star trek theme as a lullaby
i’m not a child don’t do that
look i get it this is still my room we haven’t really made it yours
which is why i got you this pink power ranger put it anywhere you like
okay but you may feel some discomfort
i’m kidding i want you to feel at home here decorate it any way that makes you happy
great and just so you know i’m not getting rid of all your stuff
uhbubububuh i can make do with just the candle
i’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom
can it be more of an internal struggle
i need to see it while i’m gone don’t breathe on my pillow
how about if i just don’t breathe at all
that’s my girl what on earth what is going on
we turned your room into a sex dungeon
okay last question the chaps he was wearing assless
can we just focus on the decision i’m facing
we can but for the record all chaps are assless
gentlemen please this is a significant decision now do amy and i continue living together or do i move back in with leonard
over my assless chaps you will
this isn’t complicated do you love amy
do you like living with her
do you know what you need to do now
apparently figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all
i understand i’ll leave you be
what you’re familiar with the reference
of course jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death
well i wouldn’t want you to starve to death so here’s an eggplant
you know some people believe that buridan was plagiarizing aristotle
although in aristotle’s example he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink
huh yeah i wonder if that’s related to the 12th century persian philosopher alghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates
are you suggesting alghazali was aristotelian ‘cause if anything he was antiaristotelian
alghazali was antiaristotelian boy you think you know a guy
okay open your eyes and see your new room
i know i went a little overboard we can always dial it back
no no no no no it’s it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want
oh that means so much i love you
just hiding some stuff in your closet don’t tell penny
it’s just a tiny skin sample you saw me do it to myself
on a scale of one to ten where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off
sheldon if i’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells i need to harvest them now i’ve done this dozens of times but if you’re too scared you don’t have to
no this is for science i can be brave for science
just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when i’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells
all right just warn me before you do it
okay three two and we’re done
you tricked me you didn’t say one
no but three two and we’re done is incomplete you know those things bother me it’s like hearing dadadadadadah without yelling…
thank you now yell charge and we can get out of here
oh my god i just got it fun onions funyuns hold on is that a wobble yes that’s definitely a gravitational wobble
uh sorry i could come back
oh no it’s okay i just found a wobble
oh do i need a mop
it’s a gravitational wobble it could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me
oh well if it has life maybe it already has a name huh
yeah but it’s probably difficult to pronounce
you think it would be more difficult than that
oh well nice to meet you
nice to meet you too you know i have to say based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food i see in this trash working here was ten years old
oh please show me a tenyearold who knows to dip tootsie rolls in nutella
bueno um i’m just going to empty your waste paper basket and then i’ll get out of your way
oh please allow me that’s a lot of empty calories
okay uh okay i have to go
good luck with your um space exploration
thank you good luck with your future endeavours
did it work are they brain cells yet
if you’d give me a minute i’ll tell you
oh just let me look oh my goodness i see quivering black lines those must be neurons oh they’re so thick and beautiful
those are your eyelashes move well sheldon i see astrocytes our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network
i have such a profound sense of creation i it’s like when i hatched sea monkeys except that this is from my dna so this is like me monkeys
these cells come from both of us
yeah but us monkeys doesn’t pop oh oh oh oh wait we monkeys there you go hey when can we start running tests on it
no reason we can’t start right now
what stimulus should we introduce it to first light sound temperature oh oh let’s
sheldon this is a rudimentary collection of neurons i mean it’s remarkable but it’s still limited in what it can do
i understand she’s the mean one i’m the fun one
huh they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli
really the last green thing i saw you eat was a skittle
well i can’t eat like a tenyearold all the time
you’re dating somebody who is it
what what are you talking about
you only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off
no she’s right as long as i’ve known you you’ve always been selfconscious about your cleavage
that’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it
all right fine don’t tell us
it’s gross but i have to eat it because i met somebody
bam thank you what’s her name
oh did you meet her at work
yes which is why she was in the telescope room yes this is all making sense good
well that’s great raj you must have so much in common
so when do we meet her
no no this is brand new we haven’t even been on a proper date yet
okay well good luck with it
how come you never eat broccoli
i’m married i don’t have to be attractive
you know most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years
still i can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells
well i turned this one into a functioning boyfriend so sky’s the limit
look look here i am standing next to the incubator uh here is a microscopic view of the cells
look at that put them in a tiny flash tshirt and it’s you
aw yeah this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20 faster than any other sample in amy’s lab
i’m running out of ways to act excited
so enough about us how are things going with you
great the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now
good you know in case the exit isn’t clearly marked
yeah i have to say it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste
are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl
well i didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it
you do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices
yeah but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise
mine has a fully developed immune system
ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a stateoftheart german incubator
okay fine let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them although we didn’t need to have sex with howard for ours so we win
this is fun i have never cleaned a toilet before
no i grew up with a house full of servants and now i have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who i have great respect for
it’s okay you’re allowed to have a cleaning lady
oh good because she also walks my dog buys my groceries and cuts my hair
i think that’s called a mommy
uh so forgive me forgive me for being nosy but is is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves
i love kids how old is he
that’s a cute age they can do so many things
he’s studying to be a lawyer at ucla
that’s wonderful a lawyer my sister’s a lawyer look at that we have something in common
maybe there are other things we have in common come dinnertime do you enjoy eating food
ay rajesh i think you’re very sweet but i work two jobs and i don’t have time for dating
yeah sure i understand yeah i’m very busy too
oh please don’t take it personal i think you’re a very nice man
i think you’re very nice as well
thank you for helping me good night rajesh
oh yes oh okay uh good night i don’t know maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes but i feel like something is happening between us
okay i’ll leave but just know every time i come in here i’ll be thinking of you
would you look at that the image we gave it was 45 white noise and it still managed to reconstruct it
i’ve never seen results like this before
yeah we need to stop for magnets on the way home this is going right on the fridge
aren’t you glad you participated in this
oh i am and you realize what the next step is
set up a second culture and try to replicate our results
uh no we lock that door lower our underpants a little and make a baby
make a baby what are you talking about
clearly the combination of our dna is exceptional our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind we’ll be able to get into any preschool we want
sheldon i’m not ready to have a baby
oh yes you are i track your cycle for the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manurecovered wheat field
wow i i can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up
i don’t understand i thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me
oh i see what’s happening here you’re playing hard to get
i’m not playing anything we’re not making a baby today
very well oops how clumsy of me you know what let me get that hey where are you going i did you even look at my bottom
oh well you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner so i thought we could have one right here
oh come on we’re in the telescope room it’ll be like dining under the stars you see this uh double zero when it says zero one that means it’s twinkling sometimes it takes a while
rajesh this is so sweet but you you know i’m working
that’s why i already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall
well i suppose that gives me a little time
oh please sit i tried to cook you a meal from your homeland
oh really you made cuban food
that depends do they have mexican food in cuba
now when he said make a baby is it possible he meant out of legos
no he was explicit needlessly and freakishly explicit
why does he need a baby he’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder
could you two really have some sort of superintelligent child
well there is a genetic component but that doesn’t guarantee anything
that’s true sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus
yeah but that’s just his earth parents we don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here
well we know they were smart enough to send him away
hey you’re talking about the person i love and have been avoiding for the past three hours oh man
well have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two
would you care for a brandy
sheldon please stop trying to seduce me
who’s trying to seduce you after a long day i always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs
i thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here
anything you’d like to pet not my hair there’s a lot of goop in it
amy come back i don’t know how to open the oysters
so um what surprised you the most when you first came to america
well i suppose how much people care about oprah’s favourite things
i thought that too but then i got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again
you know i do have some time off this sunday if you’d like to…
hey i saw your car… oh sorry am i interrupting
it’s okay uh i should get back to work
oh yeah the astronomer raj told us about you hey free toilet paper
you told him i was an astronomer
it’s okay rajesh i’m a grown woman i don’t have to waste my time with someone who’s embarrassed by me
isabella isabella wait wait let me explain
if you are embarrassed by what i do why did you pursue me
i’m sorry honestly i didn’t think your job would bother me but i guess it did and i hate myself for that but there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you
well prepare to be mortified i let my dog eat food out of my mouth not because she likes it but because i do also i know they’re pretty but i’m scared of butterflies
sorry just passing through i think this fell off your cart
come on what do you say let me make it up to you
okay this sunday night you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant
great where would you like to go
your choice it can be pakistani food if you like
and now you know how it feels
so were you turned on even a little bit
it was like being hit on by rat pack peewee herman
i’m sorry is that a yes
amy i didn’t want it to come to this but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate seductive dance known to man the flamenco
that is unbelievable good for bert
couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy
everything is stupid and i want to go home
that’s sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of bert too
hey it’s not even called the genius grant it’s the macarthur fellowship just like it’s not frankenstein it’s frankenstein’s monster which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there and if anyone’s a genius it’s me for the way i brought that full circle
how much money did he win
and he doesn’t have to use it for research he can do whatever he wants with it
oh good maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under
thanks i was as surprised as anybody when they called and told me i won i didn’t believe them and then they said no you really won and then i said cool
someone call george r r martin this guy knows how to finish a story
i’ve gotten pretty good at telling it well see ya
some genius i zinged him with sarcasm he didn’t even notice
i know and it was the greatest sarcastic quip i’ve ever heard
who leaves their bike in the hallway you know if i knew how to ride one i’d steal it
ignore him he’s just cranky because bert from the geology lab won a big grant
oh i heard him interviewed on the radio you know when they told him he won he didn’t believe it but then he did believe it it was so funny
who listens to the radio any more
bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions
they say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets
you know what i’ve met bert isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets
you used to make those jokes about me now everything is bert bert bert
you know sheldon maybe if you take the time to actually read bert’s research you’d be less bitter about him winning
you want me to read a geology paper
honestly i just want you to be quiet but i’m all out of taffy
you busy there’s somebody out here who wants to meet you
say hello to everybody’s little friend remote control stephen hawking
i found him in an old box
i didn’t buy it i made it
last question what is wrong with you
no it’s not check it out he says fun stuff
his eyes also light up in the dark
it’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work
it’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone
yeh why eh why oh that’s why
sounds like the night we had coitus
i hope you’re happy making me read this bert’s work is remarkable and i’m more upset than ever this is worse than when i had to admit that cedric the entertainer’s actually entertaining
sheldon it’s foolish to be angry that bert’s work has merit
yeah well i am angry and you telling me not to be angry makes me angry and do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel
i i knew the answer i got excited
hey buddy why don’t we go for a walk so you can calm down
that’s a good idea i guess everyone’s having them now
hey i’m trying to help you
fine you can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons
you just wave your arms a little and they fly away it’s not…
okay raj i’m gonna show you something now one of us thinks it’s offensive the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea but i’m not going to tell you who likes it
this is tough but i’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me youtube videos of people getting hit in the nuts
you’re crazy i’ve worked with hawking he’s got a great sense of humour and i think he’d like it
okay call him and show him i dare you
i have no problem calling him
while you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher
you laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts
i laughed because the guy was leonard
you’re happy with who you are you don’t get jealous of other people instead of being weighed down by ambition you just float along like a dead body in a river
i couldn’t just take the compliment i had to ask why you know i do understand what you’re feeling my brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head
how did you deal with it
i wet the bed until college but i don’t think that’s a quality fix
i can’t believe i was surpassed by a geologist i mean rocks he studies rocks if rock is so great how come paper beats it leonard i’m having a primal urge to throw this rock
do it visualize it as your anger and and toss it out of your life
perhaps i will this rock encapsulates all my negative emotions i will cast you far away feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it
ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow…
i tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot
then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot
well and what happened to you
oh i laughed so hard i burst a blood vessel in my nose it’s fine
you know it’s one thing to be envious but now you’re injuring yourself it has to stop
although if you are gonna do it again please let me know so i can get it on video
you know sheldon instead of fixating on what bert has you should appreciate all of the good things in your life you’ve got love you’re in good health you’ve got a roof over your head
yeah but you’ve got all those things and no one’s lining up to be you
anybody else want to try i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices
this is getting old fast dolores knock it off
uh do you really think calling me names is helpful
i do your life is fine you big baby
if it helps i’m questioning your life choices too
thank you penny you know i just need to keep reminding myself that bert’s success is not my failure
and that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of lifethreatening diseases
i’m conducting a quick survey do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste
do you think this is in poor taste
does it spin around and do tricks
that is hiwawious give me the wemote contwol i want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom
all right we’re done it’s offensive
well it’s a new day i have a new outlook you know i realized i don’t need to worry about other people i just need to think more about myself
oh how will we ever get used to the new you
well i’m glad to see you moving forward
bert did quality research and he deserves whatever accolades he receives
what is going on did you upgrade his software last night
i think he might be learning on his own
then the robot uprising has begun
excuse me i need to pay bert a proper congratulations
he doesn’t just look like c3po now he walks like him
bert i wanted to let you know that i read your research and your award is welldeserved
thanks i’ve been hearing that a lot ever since i won people think i’m great
well just this once you can count me as people too
you know as a macarthur grant winner i’m allowed to nominate someone for next year
so i was thinking you know engineers don’t get a lot of respect is your friend howard working on anything cool
you know i’m not sure you know you’d have to ask him excuse me off aah leonard i hurt myself again
excuse me i have to go take some pictures
i can’t believe you headbutted a water fountain
no i went to punch the water fountain slipped in water in front of the water fountain and hit my head on the water fountain
i can’t imagine you being violent
it’s not hard just picture the three stooges and then take away two stooges
i’m so disappointed in myself jealousy is completely illogical
it’s a human emotion sheldon everyone gets jealous i’m jealous of leonard and penny and howard and bernadette for being in such happy relationships
i’ve always been jealous of how much money raj’s family has
thank you for saying that next to buying things that is the best part about having money
ever since i met penny i’ve been envious of her looks
that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off
you know what i mean you were still hot but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair hot
you liked my short hair right
yeah i loved it love you love the hair would love to change the subject
seriously none of you liked it
i thought it was brave does that count as liking it
you know how come nobody’s talking about howard’s dopey haircut
i think i hate all of you nerds
oh i don’t mind if you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket it would be like i’m walking with my grandma
oh no a plaque nobody wants to see this
well change plaque to mixedrace couple and you are my grandma
i can’t take this any more knock knock knock bert knock knock knock bert knock knock knock bert
all right let’s do this bert we need to talk
rock rock water fountain i am not proud of this but i have been envious of your recent success
wow i won the macarthur grant everyone’s jealous of me once i get lasik i’ll be out of things to wish for
i was hoping by admitting my weakness to you i’d somehow be unburdened
no now that you know my weakness i hate you more than ever
well you know we’re both pretty smart i bet if we put our heads together we could come up with a solution
we hang on you’re my enemy now the enemy of the enemy is my friend and right now i’m my own worst enemy that makes you my friend okay i’m good to go
great now that we’re friends want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of ellen
you know what this isn’t gonna work
sheldon wait you know you’ve got a lot to be happy about you’re at the top of your field you have a great girlfriend
yes that’s right i have amy in the past you’ve professed feelings for her does it eat you up inside that i have her and you don’t
it used to but now that i’m rich and successful i think i can do better
i can’t believe you punched bert
i didn’t punch him he turned around and i gave him a captain kirk karate chop i’m not even sure he knows i did it
hey sheldon i’ve got someone here who might make you feel better
i understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy
thanks leonard now he’s not gonna think i’m cool
don’t worry i know how you feel i have never won a nobel prize
oh wow that doesn’t seem fair
it’s fine i’ve been on the simpsons
how do you deal with the success of your colleagues
i remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory also i was on star trek
oh it was a good one he played poker with sir isaac you don’t care
don’t waste your time on jealousy sheldon you’re too brilliant
how can you feel bad if stephen hawking says you’re brilliant
i can’t thank you professor hawking you are a gift to mankind there should be statues of you everywhere you know the lincoln memorial has a big chair we could swap you right in
i always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool
what a wonderful idea how does this man not have a nobel
do people know about her ‘cause she’s delightful
if we’re going to be staying in this apartment would you be interested in doing a little redecorating
great what’d you have in mind
let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here
well how about we start a little smaller like moving the furniture around
you know i have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building
look we can’t just throw away penny’s stuff but we can ask if she wants any of it back
you know i wonder how she feels about all this artwork
well i’m sure she misses this one i mean it’s the greatest gift i’ve ever given anybody
it truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with penny
it may have appreciated in value the artist killed himself shortly after painting that
yeah it seems only right that she have it back
i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again
look it’s the same smile she has in the painting
yeah there’s hooks in the closet i can hang it right now
oh no no those hooks are gone
uh we ran out of candy on halloween i was just giving everything away
hey guys what are you oh that’s here cool
amy wants me to have it
well it would be selfish of me to keep it
but it’s a picture of you
but you like it so much
you know leonard the more i think about it there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and i should go through uh for example who gets our beloved sword longclaw
that seems fair we did just give you the painting
yeah i don’t need anything around that i can stab myself with
wonderful longclaw is mine and how about you keep our avocado plant
sounds right a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash
although amy and i did just move in together and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift
oh we got a sword and a plant our apartment’s really shaping up
stuart you didn’t have to get us a baby gift
oh just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here going to the grocery store driving you to the doctor if you’re not in a hurry i can dig you a koi pond
and that’s not me being creepy that’s for either of you
this is very nice stuart thank you
how come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice
oh yeah uh now that you mention it can i live here
stuart we’d love to help you out but this a bad time we’re about to have a baby
or is that why this is a great time think about it when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get
thank you but i’m not really sure
hang on maybe it’s not the worst idea i mean he did do a good job taking care of my mother
that woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol
i guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes
thank you and it’s only temporary just till i get back on my feet or the baby goes off to college whichever happens first
well uh my car broke down in your driveway so i’m gonna say now but i am ready to be helpful in fact i’m gonna go vacuum
hmm actually i just did that this morning
then i’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors
oh remember when we got this at comiccon
oh yeah the mr spock cuckoo clock
so if it breaks there’d be none of it
well leonard you know who should keep this on the one hand i love mr spock more than you do on the other hand i care more about clocks than you do
so you think you should keep it
i’ll be right across the hall you’ll probably be able to hear it
oh now what about our 3d chess set
let me guess you want it
well no i just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win as a kindness i should probably take all the games
you know what sheldon take it in fact you can have everything i really don’t care
are you sure these items represent our shared times together
well you know what’s gonna happen he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his
for a man so good at predicting my moves how come you stink at 3d chess
sheldon you’re you’re being a little selfish why don’t you let leonard keep a few things
it’s not my fault i’m bad at sharing i skipped kindergarten
you know what there is one thing i would like
i would like to keep the official flag of our apartment
but you don’t even like flags
but you made me order it because you were too wellknown in the flag community and they’d jack up the price
but you don’t even understand its symbolism
oh i do the the field of blue represents you being miserable and the lion sticking its tongue out means i’m happy about it
come along amy i know when i’m not wanted
i don’t think you do but all right
how did you know it wasn’t me
there’s only three people in this house and you’d still be my fifth guess
you guys relax i’ll get it have some bread while it’s still warm
it’s like we have a butler if i had a batsuit i’d be bruce wayne
hey stuart what are you doing here
do uh howard and bernadette know or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing
no i needed a place to stay and with the baby coming i figured they could use some extra help
anyway come on in dinner’s ready
oh but i bought chinese takeout
oh okay well if bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more she can have that
is the wifi working for you
uh hang on i don’t think so i’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly but i’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets
oh i knew it sheldon changed the password
well the new network name is ha ha ha now i’ve got you so it’s either sheldon or gargamel from the smurfs
you’re good at revenge how do we get him back
well my goto move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend but i kind of feel like i’m already doing that
sheldon i know what you did now change the password back
well powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut if it isn’t leonard hofstadter
sheldon i’m warning you i can play this game too
if it’s like your 3d chess game then you’re out of your length width and depth amy get the neosporin somebody just got burned
all right i tried that should be the title of your autobiography ooh a seconddegree burn
i’ve got the neosporin who got hurt
it’s a good thing you’re cute
so i was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant cpr class
yeah we’ve been meaning to do that
oh i know a cpr instructor who’ll come to the house
i’ll give him a call we met when i was sleeping on the beach and he thought i was dead
thank you again for cooking it’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day
you just kick back and relax i’ve got it all under control
although it was already under control
it’s just that they’ve had plenty of help
well you know what they say it takes a village
well they already had a village
i noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together
yeah well maybe the village was too busy checking out the local montessori school for the new arrival
you mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox we’ll pass thank you
what do you think you’re doing
this is the level you’re stooping to
no this is the level i am stooping to i believe that is flag to crotch four checkmate easypeasy ooh so breezy
i’m here to put the crib together
ooh sorry i already did it
well i don’t know if you realize this but i bought that crib
oh yeah i read about that on whogivesacrapcom
why are you being like this
because i love howard and bernadette and if i want to keep mooching off them i need to be helpful
hey this pregnancy had an emotionallyneedy third wheel way before you came along
why can’t there be four wheels
is this what you do when i’m not here make really good points
look just come in and help me build a baby swing
if you’re hungry you can eat your takeout nobody touched it
i think i’m gonna go for a run you want to come
no last time that old lady in the park kept screaming watch out he’s right behind you hello
i don’t think so but you’re sweet for asking
what what are you doing in our apartment
oh i rented a room from your neighbour the tall guy dressed like a little boy
unbelievable okay uh i don’t know what he told you but you can’t stay here
so there are fresh linens on the bed and oh well now i see you’ve met theodore theodore these are your new room mates leonard and penny they’re very honest but i would not leave cash lying around
sheldon what do you think you’re doing
my room is paid up until the end of the month so i can do with it whatever i please which includes renting it out for a dollar a night
anyway i’ll leave you be i have to oh oh he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning apparently they still make them
all right sheldon this is over the line
that’s true but had i done something under the line there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of id
oh oh i have a receipt from a blood bank i’m onegative
and now you know as much about him as i do
oh hey bernadette the swing comes with two different mobiles the giraffes are pretty cute what do you think
although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby
yeah you’re probably right go with the zebras
at least my nose is naturally brown
hey could you please go to the market for me
get stuart or raj to do it
howie they’ve been doing everything for you
mm i know it’s really making me lose respect for both of them
please just go to the store
fine who wants to drive me to the store
take raj stuart is supposed to paint my toenails
what do you think should we go to a hotel
and just leave him here alone
okay i’ll go to a hotel text me in the morning if you’re still alive
uh theodore how long are you planning to stay exactly
oh thanks to the coins i found in your couch a day longer than i thought
i like the painting is that your mom
will you keep it down what kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think i’m running
we lived together 13 years how can you be so awful to me
i’m being awful you’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me
why i said i didn’t care
excuse me it’s none of my business but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love
yeah thanks but nobody asked you
well i’m just gonna keep on talking seems like with sheldon moving out you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another
i think he might be right also who is that
i have to admit leaving you to move in with amy has been harder than i thought it would be
well for me too it’s not the same with you gone
if you’re looking for a new guy to live with
so no one’s gonna tell me okay
leonard i would like us to stop fighting about our possessions
in fact i want you to keep the apartment flag and i’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals
i do and to show you that there are no hard feelings i am willing to rub my genitals on it as well
well if we’re rubbing genitals on things that’s where i shine
little lower to the left a little more
well i’m sure at some point we won’t even notice it’s there
yeah you’d think that but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams
i think it brings the room together
hey tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery
why do you get to do it i’m the artist
just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist
just because i look sickly doesn’t mean i’m starving
guys you heard her go see what she wants
oh oh okay okay uh uh uh i can do this we have a plan somebody please tell me the plan
meet you outside in 2 minutes
are we hugging or having a baby let’s go
oh man this is really happening you doin’ okay
all right hold on i’m gonna drive like we do in india get out of my way you syphilitic dogs
fine what do one point three billion people know about having babies
sorry i know you were just trying to help i love you
i love you too we’re good
sheldon okay you can have this back in the morning
this is for you i was going to wrap it but touching scotch tape gives me the heebiejeebies
i’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt what is this
a functional mri of my brain i did sudoku before they took it so i’d be ripped
and it’s not just an mri the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because i was thinking of you
we seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities
i didn’t put on my comehither plaid pj’s for nothing
you hate scotch tape but you love scotch plaid you are a mystery
guys wake up bernadette’s having her baby
come on we’re going to the hospital
i guess i guess we should stop
yeah i’m afraid so childbirth looming coitus this is a banner night for female genitals
now i see three of you do we know the father or is this some mamma mia nonsense
okay dad how far apart are the contractions
12 minutes why are you here
aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early
this is a hospital not the airport
i’m sorry it’s our first time
it’s okay this little one will be here before you know it do we know what we’re having
no we’re keeping it a surprise
not that old school he knows
you see i was at the doctor’s office the folder was right there so i took a peek
and talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy
sweetheart go home come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour
i’m sorry that’s ambiguous is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction so essentially like 65 minutes
i’m just throwing this out there but home births are very popular these days
sheldon what took you so long
wolowitz might hand out cigars i had to find my bubble gum cigar so i could join in without looking foolish
no i went down the stairs too fast
don’t come to the hospital we’re headed home
oh that was fast did she sneeze the baby out
we showed up too early we’ll keep you posted
okay well we’ll talk to you guys later bye she said not to come it’s gonna be a while
well first deliveries can be slow
i’m starting to rethink the flash onesie i bought this kid
i found it but it’s empty
well it doesn’t matter we’re not going to the hospital now
are you sure i’d really like to
well should we uh head back up
well while we’re all awake why don’t we go to a diner or something
oh uh i don’t know sheldon you don’t want to do that do you
it doesn’t matter what i want it’s your birthday you decide
oh my god it’s your birthday let’s do something fun
we could go to a bar
okay i can breathe again babe they want to have sex
oh of course the annual birthday booty spectacular
that’s a bit childish isn’t it
i’m sorry and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar
grape i find it the most mild
all right well you two go have fun
if we find my backup inhaler maybe we can get frisky
oh you sexy wheezy little man
do you really need to record this
you’ll be happy i did okay little one here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet you wanted to make an entrance i get it and here’s your daddy when he tries to tell you he used to be cool you can see he wasn’t
all right enough with the camera
well this is not for me this is for the baby some day she’s gonna want to see this
i’m sorry who’s gonna want to see this
i i said she but lot’s of things are she boats and cars whales like thar she blows
well okay i’m gonna sign off now this next part may contain some adult language
we made it this far without knowing and you’ve ruined it
well you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it
you told me it was a girl and i didn’t say it
you were supposed to keep that to yourself
oh yeah i guess it is hard
well i believe we were kissing like randy teenagers and your nose was whistling ever so slightly
oh don’t be you were like a foxy tea kettle
i’m not sure earlier tonight things began organically and now it’s feeling forced like all the pirates of the caribbean sequels
okay that makes sense i mean the mood’s a little different now we we don’t have to rush
oh i know but just leonard and penny think we’re doing it and i don’t want to disappoint them
and the mood continues to change
no and also i don’t want to disappoint you i you know come on it’s your birthday i can soldier through this
hold on i think i might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track
intriguing is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains
because if it did have to do with trains and you were gonna give…
not even a cozy sleeper car on the orient express
found the backup inhaler want to have sex
well i didn’t until i heard that
hang on i’m counting it’s okay
hello howard and bernadette kicked me out because i told them they’re having a girl oopsy i did it again
maybe if we’re quiet he’ll go away
you’re gonna have to be quieter than that
one second all right you can open your eyes i thought i’d let harry potter make things hotter
i got a gryffindor robe for you
what a gryffindor sleeping with a hufflepuff how scandalous you naughty girl you went to the wizarding world theme park without me
i did am i in trouble
yes you’re in trouble you went to wizarding world without me
you know i’ve been wanting to go
sheldon do you really want to argue with me on my birthday
no people just keep kicking me out everywhere i go
good then you’re used to this
come on everyone to the hospital
you have got to be kidding me
just try to relax we’ll be there any minute stuart stop driving like an old man speed it up a little
i’m not an old man i just can’t see at night
here comes another one hey squinty the gas pedal’s on the right
all right hang on if you see any pedestrians just call ’em out
howard and bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday how cool is that
this is not how i imagined this day going i should be with them right now
i know that but to be fair i’ve spent nine months helping bernadette get ready for this baby and howard spent five minutes conceiving it and i’m being generous
five minutes we must be doing it wrong it took us hours
and and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let stuart stay
i understand but this is a special day for them can you just try and let it go
she’s right you know i just learned amy went to a theme park without me but i’m not going to ruin her birthday i’ll wait and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year boop
i’m so thirsty give me more ice chips
sorry i thought these were room ice chips i’ll go get some more
uh stuart while you’re out there don’t come back
so what are we gonna name this kid now that we know she’s a girl it kind of ruins my plan for wally wolowitz
we could name her after your mom
debbie no she hated that name
did she have a middle name
ah it sucks that she’s not here
hm she would’ve been the best grandma
she did always have candy in her pocket
yeah i was 20 years old before i figured out tootsie rolls weren’t naturally warm
i didn’t know her five minutes and she asked are you a milky way or a snickers girl
thank god you answered right we wouldn’t be here today
it’s hard to believe howard’s having a kid
yeah penny you’re the one who introduced him to bernie
how many times do i have to say i’m sorry
it’s not just howard and bernadette i mean look how far we’ve all come
sheldon and i are living together
but if my mom asks we have bunk beds
penny was a struggling actress when we met and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep
okay you don’t have to say struggling every time you can just say actress
sheldon howard and i are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope
we’ve all come a long way there’s a lot to be proud of
for god’s sake just drive in the knife why don’t you
well you’re all thinking it i’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile
i was not thinking it although now that you point it out it is undeniable
raj if it’s any consolation i’m no better off than i was ten years ago
oh yay i have a doctorate in astrophysics and i’m every bit as awesome as the pastyfaced owner of a comic book store
raj show some compassion those are things that we think but don’t say
hey i’m in a hospital and i’m not the patient i’m fine
come on bernie breathe remember what you learned in birthing class
i remember thinking this is stupid and i was right
do you want me to get the nurse
no if one more person puts their fingers near my uterus i’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off
i’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents that was a big milestone for me
oh speaking of personal growth i recently tried eating swiss chard you know i didn’t swallow it but amy said it counted
hey still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone
you know raj honey you’re being too hard on yourself when i first met you you couldn’t even talk to women i mean you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room
oh great now i can say things like i can’t believe you’re breaking up with me why are you breaking up with me yes i’ll still help you move
uh yeah i got something raj not everybody could be a dog owner oh what did your doggie break up with you too
hey i bought mms at the vending machine and two bags came out
i bought the first one it didn’t fall
tired but great they’re both great
does the baby have a name yet
exactly also like the comet bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years
that’s not a real thing he’s just joking
i’m gonna get back thank you for staying up i can’t wait for halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather
you hear that stuart i’ve got a dog and a godchild you have nothing
oh look at all the babies
some will be successful some may be homeless it’s fun to think about
kind of hard to see the names
mm that one kind of looks like bernadette
they all look the same to me
guys she’s my goddaughter i think i’ll know when i see her that one
well that was quite a day
it was bernadette had her baby i made it to wizarding world and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration hankius pankius
i was afraid you’d be too tired
amy i just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line if that’s not foreplay i don’t know what is
hey can you help me put some of the food out
yeah let me finish packing this stuff up you know how sheldon is if he sees christmas stuff lying around after new year’s
yeah but he doesn’t live here anymore
well he doesn’t live at walmart but he still threw a tantrum when he saw marshmallow peeps after easter and that’s the same man who complains you can’t find marshmallow peeps after easter
oh it’s bernadette she says they’re running late the baby threw up on howard and then howard threw up on howard
well he didn’t throw up on the baby that’s a win
hi welcome back how was texas
oh you know the lone star state hmm that should be its yelp rating
it was not a great trip
yeah it is good to be home oh good lord is that mistletoe don’t you maniacs own a calendar
i told him to take it down he would not listen to me
did you at least have a good flight down there
it was fine other than the weirdtasting juice amy gave me i slept the whole way
so what happened in texas that was so bad
and before our next drive to comiccon i need the name of that juice
well we were on our way to my mother’s house…
how did we get in the car
hold on how did you get him in the car
i rented one of those carts pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest
so while we’re at your mother’s house it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together
do we have to i really don’t want to hear the religious lecture
there’s always one she gave it to my sister about her boyfriend my brother about his girlfriend my father about his girlfriend that one had some unchristian words in it
well she likes me you know there’s a chance she might be okay with it
eh i don’t know i am her precious little boy and you did take my flower
who knows what he has down there
thank you god for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it amen
given that your hands prepared it isn’t that a little selfserving
you start changing the words to the prayers next thing you know you’re in a church with a guitar
thank you for cooking it looks delicious
oh it’s my pleasure mm i’m so glad y’all could make it so tell me what’s going on back home
well uh howard and bernadette had their baby
oh that’s wonderful now have they decided to raise it jewish or regular
they haven’t said anyway we uh we also have some exciting news to share
oh wait wait shouldn’t we just eat you know i mean god did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these sloppy joes
come on shelly tell me your news
all right this is on you amy and i are living together in sin like a couple of new yorkers now while you scold us i’m going to get a knife and a fork joe may be sloppy but sheldon’s not
well thank you for letting me know and i for one am thrilled
what wh where’s the judgment wh where’s the fire and brimstone where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to hell and i say have you seen the size of the bugs outside we’re already there
obviously i would prefer if you weren’t living out of wedlock but given your special circumstances i’m very happy for you
and what special circumstances are those
oh boy i think it’s about to get bad
shelly how do i put this by your third birthday you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains and i never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them
what so you thought i was going to be alone for the rest of my life
no just for the middle part ‘cause at the end i assumed there’d be nurses
i’m the child she was worried about i have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock if i spotted them the potato
blah blah blah blah blah blah
well i was in my room i couldn’t hear what they were saying
he’s been in there a long time should i go talk to him
he’s upset with me i should be the one who talks to him
sheldon what what are you doing
just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought i was
you startin’ to see why i didn’t go in there sheldon if you’re trying to prove me wrong the tightywhities on your head ain’t changing my mind
yeah and i don’t understand why you’re taking her side by being my girlfriend she’s saying you’re a weirdo too
i don’t think that’s what she’s saying
that’s exactly what she was saying
can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange
well after that sheldon and i got out of the house for a while
well first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off and then we went out
you know i’m sorry your mother made you feel bad but you know at the end of the day she was wrong because you’re not alone
you’re right i have leonard and howard and raj stuart penny leonard’s mom bernadette wil wheaton…
what about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet
i was going chronologically you’re right between koothrappali’s father and omar the oneeyed sparkletts guy
well let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip
i knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place
she was gonna find out eventually
disagree we’ve known about evolution since 1859 she still believes in noah and his amazing zoo boat this could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me
sheldon i knew your mother was fine with us living together because i already told her we were
this was a potential issue so i got out ahead of it and i managed the situation for you
so my mother thought i was incapable of finding a mate and my mate thinks i’m incapable of running my own life
not your whole life i mean science you got that organizing your sock drawer you’re the king but understanding how other people are feeling that’s a weak spot for you
i have gotten much better at that
have you how am i feeling right now
what how should i know excited itchy give me the first letter
you and i are in a relationship i help you with your shortcomings and you help me with mine
how would you feel if i contacted your mother behind your back
delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all
delighted what not if i guessed for a hundred years
the baby’s asleep can we put her in your room
no i got it doubtfire poppins follow me
oh it’s no problem amy and sheldon were just telling us about their trip to texas
yeah here i’ll catch you up
how did we get in the car
stop okay they told mary they were living together there was a fight he got his feelings hurt then he put underwear on his head
on purpose not the way it used to happen in high school
really so you can control it
well there’s really not much left to tell i decided that my mother views me as a child because i never went through a rebellious phase so i got an earring flashback to sheldon screaming my mother made me take it out flashback to sheldon screaming amy put alcohol on it flashback to sheldon screaming and here we are
i couldn’t explain it if i tried
so tell me how did sheldon look with an earring
like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet
so what did you and leonard do
actually we got in a pretty nasty fight
it might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had
well we had started bingewatching luke cage together and it was kind of our thing and then i find out that she watched two episodes without me
it’s like i was excited for a present and got socks
i don’t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life
i don’t understand what’s wrong with socks
to be fair we may have been on edge because of the christmas tree
you do make a cute elf
oh yeah and you thought spock ears were only good for comiccon
hey hey i just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree
oh cool i’ll be like a pointyeared paul bunyan
no what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe you don’t let go
for the tenth time my mittens were slippery
ugh it’s 70 degrees you didn’t need mittens
you know how easily i blister
yes yes you bruise you peel it’s like i’m married to an old piece of fruit
look we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night or or we can stop and try to salvage the evening
there’s no shame in asking for a break
if i need a break i’ll ask for a break
you want to decorate it tonight
yeah with gasoline and a match sure
i hope it kills us both
by the way if anyone asks the elevator shaft always had a tree in it
so bernadette if i express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it
hey how’s life with your baby
really you’re never gonna touch their baby
to this day i’ve never touched stuart
it’s been wonderful sheldon thanks for asking
oh please stop crying i’m begging you i don’t know what else to do my boobs are empty do you want lasagna shh shh shh it’s okay it’s okay shh what have we done
hey i found superhero baby wipes the perfect way to clean up crime and tushies
it took me two hours to get her down
you know in india when my baby brother cried like that the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it not always sometimes we’d leave
hey he got her to stop
oh he’s really good with her
no they’re not you bozo how come stuart can get her to stop crying but i can’t
i mean it’s stuart maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away
everyone’s a better mom than me
oh don’t take it so personally maybe your baby’s just a jerk
wait so how does the story end is the baby a jerk or is bernadette a bad mother
what is there another twist coming is the baby not theirs at all
ignore him how did you get the baby to stop crying
oh i just talked to her i’ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep
you poor things you must be exhausted
it has been hard to sleep with all the crying
how can she hate me i make her food in my chest it’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine
she doesn’t hate you stop saying that
it says here that up to 80 of new mothers experience baby blues and that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job bernadette you are doing a good job
thank you sheldon i’m feeling better now
thank you internet i’m telling you with the right youtube video i can give howard a vasectomy
so things started to turn around
yeah eventually i figured out how to get the baby to sleep
please tell me you didn’t use amy’s magic juice
i didn’t know what else to do it worked
well i’d say that’s thinking outside the box but come on
do you need help getting out
i think i live here now it’s fine
is it okay if i get some sleep
good job mommy i’m proud of you
good night i love both my girls
i can’t believe you fit in the crib
i could take a bath in the sink i don’t but i can
oh thank you for asking uh i uh went to visit my grandmother she’s in bakersfield uh usually my brother and sister go… oh come on
oh a small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off
with pay sucka forgot the baby still new to this
well it sounded like you were having a rough day so i wanted you to come home to something nice
hey do you remember when we went wine tasting in santa barbara and you said that was you’d ever had
yeah i remember us driving up there going to the winery and that’s it
oh hey what smells so good
i made your favourite pizza bagels
pink wine and pizza bagels it’s like eighth grade all over again i am so lucky to have you
well now be careful these are hot i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust but instead i’m gonna keep it to myself
oh you always know what not to say i just i can’t believe you did all this
well you know it’s easy to take each other for granted and i never want to do that to you because your love it’s like a river it’s peaceful and deep your soul is it’s like a secret that i could never keep
you did not just quote an nsync song
i quoted your favourite nsync song
damn i burped so hard i died in my game
leonard i’ve been meaning to ask you what size shoe do you wear
i’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives
that’s nice i wear a size eight and a half
that’s small so tell me do you have any plans for the weekend
are you gonna laugh at the answer
only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes
if you must know penny won a spa weekend from work and she’s taking me
oh well you know that is interesting i wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with my money’s on fungal they’re still having girls night across the hall
so hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night
at our age why don’t we call it man’s night
because we just spent our allowance on comic books
penny is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here but you don’t live here any more so it’s basically my girls’ night
i hadn’t really thought about it
but now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you i get that
things going well with you and sheldon living together
better than ever he asks about my day takes an interest in my life he’s like my boyfriend in college except he’s real so people can see him
i’ve been seeing him for years i’m still not convinced he’s real
hey can i ask you a question you’ve been married for a while is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap
well leonard used to do all these things like bring me flowers and wear pants
it’s okay howie never has on pants the domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now
well sheldon always has his pants on i don’t think i could pick his knees out of a lineup
well it’s not just the pants it’s just it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more
uh penny i don’t know how to say this but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out
all right got halley to sleep
yeah i heard you on the baby monitor didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from walking dead into a lullaby
yeah got to get her hooked on tv or someday she’ll want me to play outside boy that floor is so squeaky i’m surprised i didn’t wake her up walking out of the room
have you tried anything to fix it
well i put the rug down it didn’t help
i know blue shag what were you thinking
did try nailing a couple of the boards down
yeah it left little holes in the floor that’s why i bought the rug
if you do that i’ll win in eight moves i’ll win in five moves i’ll win in one move
oh penny i’m trying to take an interest in other people uh how was your girls’ night
hmm did you have anything to eat
well i’m just playing tennis against the drapes here
hm at least he took an interest
hey what’s going on with you
i don’t want to talk about it
well hey come on just tell me
fine lately i kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted
what where is this coming from
leonard she might be drunk all she had was chips
it’s just since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more
this is exactly why i didn’t want to talk about it
no no no no let’s talk about it i’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one please tell me what more i could do
okay you know what maybe i’ll take amy with me to the spa this weekend instead
amy is free she had a harp lesson on saturday but it got cancelled boy when you take an interest in people you really uncork a geyser of nonsense
okay thanks daddy he said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing
hang on no offence to her father but he’s not an mit trained engineer thinking and building is what you do
mit’s motto is mind and hand which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager
oh come on we just need to be more creative what if you didn’t step on the floor at all like what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling
okay um okay what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness
i have one what if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall
is that supposed to be funny
i’ll call you when we get to the hotel
and if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo
i will bring them home so you can show me how godzilla takes a shower
you know what i feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained
well if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me then i’ll miss you x plus one
if you miss me x plus one i’ll miss you open paren x plus one close paren to the second…
here you’re sad so i made you tea
and it’s just the way you like it
good lord i made you tea just drink it
well what can we do to cheer you up
you want to play jenga or uh ticket to ride hearthstone what would you be the happiest losing at
i don’t want to play a game sheldon
wow and i remember when you loved playing games with me maybe penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in
its not that i’d stopped trying its just how relationships progress they start with infatuation but over time mellow into something more comfortable
hmm yeah you’re right it’s like when i first encountered the pythagorean theorem you know i was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides but now i’m just like eh
okay this grid represents the room all we need to do is plot out where each squeak is and we can find a quiet path to the crib
it looks like a map from dungeons and dragons
mm except the creature in the crib is a levelnine poop monster
okay uh you check for squeaks and i will mark them down
okay space a3 here we go it’s squeaking mark it
it’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well
mm i hope she has the same amount of sex in it i did none next square
why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that
it’s a tradition of my people singing if i were a rich man ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum
material girl needs ot be retired that is your karaoke song
would you like to play a driving game i invented
is it about the failing state of my relationship with penny
never mind you know penny went to this spa to be away from you are you sure you should be going there
i don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out
very well you got married spur of the moment i don’t see why your divorce should be any different
i would pull this car over and kick you out but if penny dumps me you’re all i got
when was the last time you got a massage
sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away
leonard stood on me once too but he was just trying to see the rose parade
i don’t know the protocol are you gonna be naked for your massage
hmm then this is probably too many clothes
okay leonard i really appreciate that but i need a little time to myself
okay i don’t get it you said make an effort here i am making an effort
hello amy it’s nice to see you
and that’s how you make effort look effortless
all right can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow
i don’t understand what you want
i’m trying to figure it out
you know what if you’d like i could whip up a quick relationship agreement well i’m at a spa i might as well do something relaxing
sheldon why don’t we give them some privacy
very well hey later we’ll check out the minibar i’ll show you how godzilla gets drunk
so what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak watch it’s easy
don’t do that in socks i almost broke my neck
then simply sit spin stand stretch maybe in looser pants then step grab tiny pivot pull and you’re there easy peasy mac and… you get the idea
you actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark
hold on i don’t think she was impressed
bigger problems i felt something pop
there’s a cucumber in my water
do they know it’s there i mean should i tell somebody
it’s there on purpose it’s refreshing
interesting the world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable but you put ’em together and bleugh
oh good you’re here are you still fighting if you get divorced do i get two christmas’s
listen we realized that uh we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple
yeah and there are a few things we need to stay on top of so we thought it would useful and i can’t believe i’m about to say this um
would you please help us make a relationship agreement but one that’s tailored to us okay we don’t need a bathroom schedule
although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance
i get to write a contract i say let’s get this party of the first part started
do you really think that’s funny
it’s in our agreement i have to laugh
if you find this draft acceptable then i believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed
article 8 subsection b leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours penny is not home this includes boxers briefs thongs gstrings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs
does it really need to say that
i did this for free let me get a little something
article 10 subsection c if questioned penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t other unacceptable responses include it’s nothing don’t worry about it and i said it’s nothing don’t worry about it
i think this all looks good
oh well great then here you sign here date here and penny if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting leonard in as is condition
i remember signing our first relationship agreement
mm you seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause
what’s going on with that woman you’re dating
she said she didn’t want to see me any more and i found that insulting
i thought things were going well what happened
i don’t know she didn’t even give me a reason
that’s not a problem we can figure this out what are the reasons women reject raj
can we not play this game
ignore him yeah sorry about the breakup
of course you’re fine not every member of a species finds a mate sir isaac newton died a virgin look at the contributions he made
so now you think you’re better than isaac newton oh no wonder women don’t like you
what he said he was fine
sometimes people say things they don’t mean
oh that’s a paradox i mean if you meant what you just said then that means you may not have meant what you just said
careful i saw this on star trek smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon hey
well i thought we were having a nice conversation but it turns out i was being offensive
we were discussing raj’s recent breakup and apparently i was insensitive to him
don’t fall for it he’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin and suddenly you’re the bad guy
sheldon when i said i was fine i meant i didn’t want to talk about it any more
then why didn’t you say that
because that’s not what people do
well i would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind
no no you don’t you really don’t i actually can’t say don’t enough
well it certainly would be easier you have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues
okay now you’re just showing off
you know i just read that a team at mit developed a device that helps people read human emotions
and you think we can get those guys to reprogram sheldon cool
it’s supposed to be accurate like 85 of the time
wow i find that hard to believe
that a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them
i take it back i believe it
you if it’s at mit i can make some calls maybe we can get sheldon a prototype
a machine that reads emotions is intriguing it could help me be a more considerate friend
it could also help me identify my enemies discover their fears and then i could use those fears to destroy them
now that sheldon’s across the hall have you decided what you’re doing with his old room
i was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room
you could make it a train room
i don’t like trains you like trains
i know and amy says i can’t have a train room
sheldon i just heard from the guys at mit about that emotion reader they’re sending a prototype for you to beta test
wonderful although i’m not sure how i feel about being used as a guinea pig
well when you get the machine you can find out
maybe i could use it to understand why women keep dumping me
well you don’t need a machine for that just send a survey card to all your exgirlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize
that’s actually not a bad idea maybe i could even get them all together sort of like a a focus group to find out what’s wrong with me
no raj that’s a terrible idea
hey great news the tv i want will fit in the gaming room and if i leave the curtains open i can watch it from work
hey can you hold off redoing the room my brother’s coming out here in a few weeks
oh yeah okay sure what’s going on with your brother
my dad asked if i can get him a job interview at my work
huh is that a good idea i mean you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs
well i sell pharmaceuticals that’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs
well i’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon how long do you think he’ll stay
i i’m not sure maybe a few days unless he gets the job then who knows
hmm who knows that’s exciting i’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here
you don’t have a problem with this do you
of course not i mean he’s your brother
okay thank you you’re the best mm
remember that when the new tv falls off the wall and crushes us both
this thing’s pretty cool it interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate
it’s amazing a machine can do that
yes now when the robots rise up they’ll know that i’ve been rooting for them the whole time
the display is synced to your phone give it a try
all right now i’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately
okay remember it can only detect happy sad angry and excited not other things you’re feeling like what have i done with my life
okay i’m looking at the first picture
aw somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth but all right
okay what does it say i’m feeling
yes i’m looking at a picture of my grandma
oh that makes sense ’cause she’s gone and you miss her
and you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future what now see now it says you’re mad make up your mind
okay emily yeah sounds great see you then
yeah i’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how i can be a better boyfriend
oh god you went through with that what is wrong with you
we are going to find out
why would you do that raj
well i want information in order to improve myself
you’re not gonna get information you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings
don’t worry i’m a grown man i have a thick skin
hey would you take a look at my brother’s résumé i’m trying to help him clean it up a little
yeah sure he really worked with the drug enforcement agency
he didn’t know it till he was cuffed but yeah
hey leonard if you’re happy and you know it no need to clap your hands because i have an emotion detector
that’s great i’m happy for you
no wait uh hold on oh what you are aren’t you sweet
what’s that are you working on your resume
no it’s my brother’s i’m trying to help him get a job out here
oh ooh and that makes leonard angry
what leonard please i know an angry face when i see it it’s this red frowny guy on my phone
what are you really upset about randall coming
leonard if you’re mad about this just tell me
fine you invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for god knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first
he’s my brother i didn’t think i needed your permission
well hey now she’s angry too this thing works like gangbusters
i’m not saying you have to ask my permission but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay
like you talked to me about your gaming room
our gaming room i was gonna put a scented candle in it
if you were this upset why didn’t you say so when i told you
because i didn’t want to sound like a jerk
well you sound like one now i don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while
if you get him a job he’s gonna live here forever
he would get his own place
has he ever had his own place
did it have a metal toilet next to the bed
it still counts you know how is this any different from you making me live with sheldon
hey i shared my honey nut cheerios with you
you gave me a bill at the end of every month
stay out of this you and your stupid machine started this fight
you are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings
i think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it
fine i’ll just give them the finger
okay first off i want to thank you all so much for coming howard is here to interpret for emily and to take notes
no he doesn’t think it’s stupid
uh heads up both of you are named emily so we’ll call you redheaded emily and you redheaded emily junior
hey you went out with him i didn’t
okay uh let’s get things started um why don’t we go around the room say your name and why you broke up with me want to kick it off
oh okay um i’m lucy and i broke up with raj because i have severe social anxiety and he kept trying to force me into uncomfortable situations
i did do that i can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries howard would you write that down
okay um i’m claire and i guess i broke up with you because you were just really needy also you were incredibly vain like all the time you spent shaping your eyebrows
okay new rule everybody only gets one uh next
ooh i’m not sure i’m comfortable sharing details about our relationship in front of howard
oh he’s here to support me so anything you have to say you can say in front of him
okay well whenever you and i were in bed…
not a chance so you were telling us how raj was terrible in bed
sheldon dinner’s ready i made beef loaf because i know you’re uncomfortable with the nonspecificity of meat loaf sheldon hey are you okay
i wish i never tried that device and i know i said the same thing after the massage chair but this time i mean it
i’m sorry leonard and penny hurt your feelings
it’s more than that it’s me i always knew i had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions but that machine just made it so real
well everybody has things that they need help with like me i can’t see without my glasses and right now you’re just a a cute pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge
i thought i was getting better at it but clearly i’m not
yes you are there have definitely been days when i was sad and you could tell
yeah but that’s shooting fish in a barrel you’re kind of a sad sack i’m sorry i shouldn’t have said that i’m just upset
no see right there you knew you hurt my feelings and i’m proud of you for reasons i’m sure have something to do with my father and if you don’t like that machine get rid of it because i love you exactly the way you are
i feel the same way about you now put your glasses back on you look weird
i thought you were great but oh my god you were so dominated by your parents
oh yeah that used to drive me nuts he’s kind of a mama’s boy
okay that’s enough write down loving son
can i just say something going out with raj was one of the best things that ever happened to me
let me finish it’s like i needed to go through that experience to know what exactly i don’t want in a man
well that’s hard to hear but i’ll still take you back
you know the same thing happened to me after i broke up with raj i met gary who’s just amazing
sorry is that gary with one r or two
would you stop writing wait so did all of you go on to better relationships after me
oh wow don’t let him get away
uh basically she traded you for bruce wayne
okay maybe we should just end this
wait hang on i just want to point out to everyone here this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself even at the risk of being humiliated and i for one think that’s very brave
honestly i’m surprised you two didn’t wind up together
well like you gals i had to suffer through him to find bernadette
oh it’s fine you needed a suitcase i wasn’t home you borrowed a suitcase
that was six years ago i’m talking about tonight
oh well i thought we were going in order
look we got really angry at each other and you just got caught in the middle of it
yeah well you should be your socks were still in it i had to throw it away anyway i uh trust that you’ve resolved your conflict
mm penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for randall to visit
hopefully he won’t be too upset
oh you’re his little girl he can’t stay mad at you
he won’t be mad at me i mean you’re the one who doesn’t want my brother to come so…
so you’re gonna throw me under the bus
oh i’m gonna throw you so hard i might actually win a stuffed animal
uh guys it sounds like you’re getting angry again
yes i don’t need an emotion machine i am one
thanks ladies this was fun let’s not wait so long for another bizarre awkward night
well that was a waste of time i’m such an idiot
don’t beat yourself up that’s what i’m here for
maybe i won’t settle down maybe i’ll just play the field
yeah the field was just here the field said no
okay i’ll tell you what i’ll make you a deal 30 years from now if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and bernadette you and i can give it a go
i appreciate the offer but if things don’t work out with you two i’m swooping in on her like a vulture
but theoretically if you and i were in a gay relationship how would we tell people like print up announcements
i don’t know what difference does it make
well i want to make sure we get invited to all the parades
yeah well if you want to march in a fishnet crop top you better lay off that dip
if you didn’t want me to eat it why’d you put it out
it was for the girls they broke up with me i don’t care if they get fat
oh you want to bet you never exercise
fine look i’ll exercise right now one two these are crunches by the way
very mature keep eating like that you’re gonna have a heart attack
okay how about if i eat like this
hey is that any way to talk to your future husband
hey i was being hypothetical okay i would never marry you
please when you see the ring i pick out you’re gonna melt
yeah right wait is it rose gold actually don’t tell me i want to be surprised
so did you wind up sending that machine back
i did you know i’m not even sure how accurate it was i took it to the train store it said everyone was sad
i finally got halley to sleep
you know i just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years
it’s true pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy
so all we need to do is get sheldon knocked up
we can’t he was already fixed when i found him at the shelter
hey uh bernadette let’s test this theory what do you think i’m feeling right now
let’s see you’re better than us a little bit sorry for us but mostly glad you don’t have to be us
keep filling this one with babies she’s good
okay i’m zeroing out the electroosmotic flow rate in the microfluidic channel
well my wife is fourfootten and sexually satisfied so clearly i know my way around tiny things
good for you on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child
those are just the things i say out loud
gentlemen we need to stop immediately
i’m looking at the math and i think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller
that’s great but the air force approved the specs we’re good to go
yeah it doesn’t need to be smaller
shame on you where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude i’ll tell you we would have the standard and the miniature poodle but no toy or teacup which by the way is not an officially recognized breed but that’s just poodle politics
can we please stop talking about poodles
fine candy bars now do you enjoy a fun size i know you do
sheldon we don’t need to make this smaller and your work is done go home
i don’t want to go home
fine go for a little walk
at least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks
i know that’s why i keep refilling his water when he’s not looking
i don’t care if we’re in a drought it’s worth it
you know i do have a way to get him out of our hair i’ve been holding onto this for a few years but maybe now’s the time
we can just lock the door you don’t have to kill him
you can’t kill him he’ll just respawn at the last save point
oh that was my sixth trip to the bathroom as long as that’s not a urinary tract infection that’s a personal best
hey uh buddy i got you a little present
congratulations the bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at the nevada northern railway you are at the throttle you are the engineer you are running the locomotive this doesn’t happen very often but here comes a hug oh dear i have to tinkle again
for howie’s occupation should i include that he was an astronaut
well he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy so why not
i can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant
uh the one at caltech has a crazy wait list i warned you a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant
well i didn’t i also skipped a birthing class to see zootopia so back off
sorry howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on
is there anything we can do
sure open up a college fund shop for life insurance and in the laundry room there’s a mountain of dirty laundry wash it or burn in your choice ugh be right back
no no i will take care of it
while i’m gone you can think about how mean you were to me
all right you know what you need a night away from all of this you know where you can just kind of relax and i’m just gonna turn this off much better seriously let’s plan a night you know give you a break we could go dancing
oh all this week the early music society of pasadena is doing a joint concert with the san gabriel renaissance choir
okay that’s the one to beat
good luck people have been saying that for 600 years
you’ll never believe it leonard gave me the most incredible gift a trip to a historic railway and i get to operate an actual locomotive
wow he finally used it what’d you do
no idea all i know is i’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day
well i’m really happy for you
oh no it’s not just me no the railway is four hours from the nearest airport and guess who gets to drive me
oh oh and guess where we get to sleep our choice of a turnofthecentury railway bunkhouse or a working caboose now the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose on the first day i get to drive a steam engine oh and the second day a diesel engine oh and if i volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork they’ll let me stay as long as i want so you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives
oh get this i get to take a test based on a 125page manual i get to learn things like hand signals ooh there’s forward uh reverse set the brakes are you done yet you’re missing
this train thing worked out better than i thought he’s home studying the engineer’s manual
it’s so peaceful without him here can i ask you how much that cost
four thousand dollars worth every penny
just wanted to see how the guidance system’s coming along
great we found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs
as a cooling solution it’s pretty cool
oh nothing just some math we don’t need
this is a different approach are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller
it’s just a theory uh it’s not even worked out
but we’ve already met the agreed upon specs going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations
so get the kid with the two shirts to do it
sir uh if i may uh we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype it’s a really elegant solution and most importantly it works
okay but that’s just a theory it’s not even a complete thought
you both make excellent points and thank you for presenting it so articulately make this
the kid with the two shirts screwed us again
all right you guys ready to get crazy
well the bra under here ain’t beige
okay you ladies have fun tonight
don’t worry about halley uncle stuart’s on the job
under the careful supervision of her godfather
my apologies i didn’t mean to offend you don corleone
like i said you ladies have fun
we will got my dancing shoes got my breast pump let’s party
you know if you pump at the bar i promise we’ll get free drinks
no she’s busy you call howard
okay instead of arguing all night let’s just split up the baby chores
yeah great um i’ll put food in her top half you deal with whatever comes out the bottom
i can’t believe we have to ask sheldon to come back and help us
oh boohoo i spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon what is that
i don’t know but if he yells it’s alive we run
oh hey if you knocked i couldn’t hear you i’m welding this locomotive engine and if you didn’t knock how about some manners
how’d you even get that up the stairs
i said to myself i think i can i think i can and then i couldn’t so i paid two men who promised not to come rob us later
okay look sheldon the colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller and we can’t do it without you
interesting well so i was right
open a window it’s about to get smug in here
well i would love to help you but since i discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine i don’t think i can go back to theory i’m an engineer now and hey just to be clear a train engineer not that goofy kind you are
sheldon you can still go on the trip in a few weeks just help us out
sorry i need to work on this engine so when i get to the train yard i won’t look foolish
he’s worried about looking foolish that’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there
come on you know you’re not leaving physics why are you doing this
leonard in the world of theoretical physics you never finish so much is unprovable but when i was studying that railway guide it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked then it clacked then it clicked then it clacked clickclack clicketyclack and here we are whoowhoo
hey did you hear anything back from the caltech preschool
not yet but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open
okay stop that no more preschool talk tonight is about having fun
nothing says fun like being scolded
hang up we don’t need help
i don’t need your help deciding when we need help
yes so i was just warming up some milk for halley and i thought it smelled a little funky so i checked the date that you wrote on the bottle and it says flerbsday
i’m sure it’s fine but if you’re worried there’s extra milk in the freezer
okay yes i will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch
stuart don’t you drink my milk
okay give can you guys handle this or not
oh of course we can uh you girls have a good time she said i was in charge
hmm so we just throw this away
what else are you gonna do with it put it in your coffee
well i don’t take it black
okay this is everything he had on the board i’m sure we can figure the rest out
all right hmm feel free to jump in hmm is all i got
oh we can get this is there any chance it’s upsidedown
maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us
it’s classified if we tell anyone we’d get in trouble
hey i came up with that and hmm you haven’t pitched anything
just keep thinking i got it
no but when we show this nonsense to sheldon it will make him crazy and he’ll have to fix it
yeah i know that’s not even a math symbol that’s just charlie brown’s hair
sorry guys this club was so great how could they turn it into a bookstore i thought we got rid of all those
renaissance choir’s looking pretty good right now huh
nothing to worry about she’s just been crying for a little while and i was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep
she was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her
she was blowing a spit bubble it was adorable
you guys got this do you need me to come home
oh okay false alarm little parenting tip sleeping babies hate flash photography
yeah i may have just left my infant daughter with patrick and spongebob
hey there’s another dance club nearby i mean i don’t know how you feel about latin music but according to their horas of operación they’re open
maybe we should just call it a night
you sure they’re open till dos
yeah we’re all dressed up why go home
i’m just not really in the mood anymore
i don’t know this is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth
i’m not sad i just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants
i’m not sad i mean hello
okay maybe i’m the one who’s sad
maybe the fact that you went and had a baby
you’re upset i had a baby
no of course not i just i didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings
pressure i mean she’s looking at preschools she has a minivan she has a 401k before she talked about it i just thought that was a race
you think that stuff is fun being a parent is terrifying i’m constantly worried i’m always tired and in a few minutes i’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot
i get that okay it’s just leonard and i have been married for two years and we’re no further along than when we were dating
come on you’ve got so much to feel good about you’ve got a great job now
yeah i guess i am making decent money
you make more than i do
you may not have a house yet but your apartment’s great
and leonard loves you so much he married you twice
i’m not even engaged once i don’t even know if sheldon thinks about marriage i’m not getting any younger honestly i kind of thought by now we might have had some sort of…
careful the sound of crying can make me lactate
i’m sorry i can’t help it
oh that’s gonna make me cry
well sheldon turns out we didn’t need you after all
that’s right we figured it out all by ourselves wasn’t even that hard
well good for you guys look i have a grease smudge on my hand and i’m okay with it
aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are
no thanks i’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump
oh well i guess it’s fixed
oh no what should we have done differently
well first of all you can’t use relativistic and nonrelativistic vectors in the same equation
told ya can you fix it for us
okay but this is the last time nice try blockheads
come on sheldon you can’t turn your back on physics and besides you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff
but if you really want to learn the mechanical side i can teach you anything you want to know
and instead of standing around watching you can help us build your smaller guidance system
and with all these new skills you’d be able to fix any model train you’d be the king of the train store
excuse me i have a girlfriend i’m already king of the train store
oh what choice do i have you need me i’m like the crankshaft of this team
well whatever it is it looks heavy i’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before amy comes home
i apologize that it’s so warm in here
i’ve worked up a bit of a sweat
gps says we’ll be at the railway in three hours
i can get us there in two
this is an euler’s disk it’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum potential energy and kinetic energy
aw look at you watching sports
we’re betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin
its weight and smoothness along with the slight concavity of the mirror means it can spin for a long time
but raj is from india which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath
okay i want in ten bucks says i’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning
hey sheldon i found a great restaurant for date night
yeah we’re seeing if raj can hold his breath longer than it
you know deepsea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage
yeah see what’s happening here signals brain damage my god how long does this thing spin for
ha you’re interested you’re out ten bucks
dig deep like when we bet you couldn’t fit into howard’s pants
come on raj it’s like your favourite movie you’re just waiting to exhale yeah i knew you could do it
and j and just so you know my favourite movie is princess bride
hello rajesh how are things by you
good good uh listen i just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill it might be a little high this month
well you’re a grown man with a steady job why wouldn’t you spend all your father’s money
oh daddy you’re so rich and funny
yeah so what else is going on with your life
uh well i was dating a woman at the university but we broke up
i know you are that’s why you just bought me a new ipad and before you start i am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me
oh i gave up on that a long time ago
it’s too much work you’re an adult who can’t get by without an allowance from his parents women don’t want that
what are you saying that you’re giving up on me what kind of father gives up on his son
i have six children five of whom are married and selfsufficient i don’t think i’m the problem
i can’t believe what i’m hearing this is deeply hurtful
you’re also too sensitive women don’t want that either
the food here’s supposed to be great don’t fill up on chips
oh i won’t i only eat equilateral triangles isosceles isosceles oh scalene you didn’t see that
oh look it’s bert at the bar we should go say hi
because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place
i have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise
sheldon there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom
if the judge couldn’t explain it to me i don’t see how you will
oh hey guys what brings you here
i doubt it i met her on gharmony that’s a web site for geologists to find love
yeah their slogan is we’re all about dating and not the carbon14 kind
if you think that’s more fun than talking to zachary quinto through a stall door you’re crazy
you know we could’ve come to you guys you didn’t have to bring the baby here
oh it’s okay it’s good to get out of the house
and the car ride puts her to sleep
aw that used to work with sheldon
yeah until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out
who forgot to crack the window
oh someone’s been shopping at gucci
yeah i saw something for halley and i couldn’t resist
yeah it’s a crushed velvet baby cape
oh no now we have two
yeah it was but it’s my father’s money and i’m mad at him
what’s going on with your dad
and if you really want to hurt him i look great in chanel
it turns out he doesn’t care if i’m married or if i’m single he’s basically given up on me
oh i’m sure that’s not true
it is he stopped trying to find indian girls for me to marry
but all you did was complain when he did that
wait leonard he’s hurting let him feel how he feels
yeah shoes i’m a sevenandahalf boots i’m an eight
msn search altavista and ask jeeves you
sorry i don’t have a list of defunct search engines that i miss
hey looks like i got stood up so i’m gonna head out
oh no are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes
nah gharmony recommends after two hours it’s time to cut bait
bert i insist that you join us
thanks i’ll go grab a chair
sheldon that was so sweet of you
well i could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad
so the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in
you want me to look at him and listen to him
my father thinks the reason i can’t make a relationship work is because i’m spoiled
i’m sorry is he waiting for someone to disagree
just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that i’m spoiled
all right how much exactly does he pay for
okay i’ll tell you but please don’t judge me he pays for my car my rent and my credit cards
yeah women do like a man that can support himself
but bernadette makes more money than howard she basically supports him
good question let’s see infoseek webcrawler oh hotbot
all right how did you guys meet
ourour first date was at a coffee shop
although unlike your date she actually showed up oh he looks sad again
well i really envy your relationship other than you two only having sex once a year you’re the perfect couple
uh yeah everyone at the university does
no no i only told leonard howard raj kripke uh professor wu professor klein and a lunch lady in the cafeteria how everyone else found out is a mystery to me
why aren’t you talking to me
oh well now i’m sorry i asked
sheldon it’s humiliating thanks to you my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life
what is there to gossip about we barely have one
is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again if you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me perhaps we could come up with a signal that works
you don’t need your dad’s money you can get by on your salary
yeah well we work at the same place as you and we’ve always been fine
oh please look in the mirror you both look ten years older than i do
all right hang on we can figure this out let’s just go over your expenses how much is your rent
i don’t want to say because i don’t know how much it is
you don’t how much your rent is
my father pays for it do you know how much your rent is
well then double it because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump
do you know how much your car costs
well how much do you spend on food
oh my god you really are spoiled
i’m spoiled your baby has a cape that costs 300
well wait this is our first fight as a couple who live together
i’m not sure of the protocol television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch but of the two of us you’re clearly more sofasized
i’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not
this isn’t fair you’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with penny
that’s different she’s a close friend not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches
that lady has a name i don’t know what it is but one time i accidentally called her mom
sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live
when you moved here you didn’t have a lot of money how’d you get by
well sometimes you can get free food and wifi from the neighbours just know you might have to marry one of ’em
hey you guys let stuart live with you why not raj too
what what are you doing i i i schlepped the baby over i brought imported beer why don’t you like me
i thought we were best friends
we are that’s why i’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless
i’m sorry raj we really just don’t have the space
what if he lives in your garage
guys i’m not living in a garage
wait why are we talking about our place when sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty
raj if you need a place to stay of course you are welcome here
thank you but if i’m gonna just take advantage of my friends i might as well keep on relying on my father
okay only if you’re sure whew
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy
not exactly the welcome wagon but i’ll take it
i’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed i call these circles zones of privacy don’t google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals this circle contains only me and you it represents subjects we only share with each other details of physical intimacy bathroom habits although as i’m saying it i may need to add dr fink in here
are you really worried about revealing secrets to stephen hawking
no i was just excited to list him as a friend
well i do appreciate you working on this
i’m sorry you were embarrassed and now i understand that some things are just between you and me and in the event of redness and swelling dr fink
what’s that little dot in the middle
that’s reserved for thoughts i don’t share with anyone
interesting you really have secrets you don’t tell me
fine two years ago i got my driver’s license
what why didn’t you say anything
i like being chauffeured around it makes me feel important
so when i got up at 4am to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum i didn’t have to
no you didn’t but keep in mind i felt extremely important
hello father we need to talk
i have come to an important decision i will not be accepting your money any more i’m a man and i can take care of myself
yes that is wonderful you will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled
i am so proud of you
dad i’m trying to tell you off and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief
sorry oh no my grown son is going to stop spending all my money where did i fail as a father
yeah that’s right keep asking yourself that but i still love you very much so don’t cut me out of the will
oh you brought your own lunch good for you
yeah i’m making a bunch of changes this morning i fired my dog walker
oh how’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom
uh i gave her an imodium that’s tomorrow’s problem
excuse me may i have your attention please i have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with amy farrah fowler has become water cooler gossip and i just want to say shame on all of you we’re scientists our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge not the intimate details of other people’s lives
he’s right and i’m sorry for the part i played in this
thank you bert you’re a good man that woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out
that doesn’t paint me in the best light
oh oh i’m sorry correction that woman not only had vigorous coitus with bert she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done – that better
all right well to sum up focus on science keep your nose out of other people’s business and uh whoa for a good time call bert
well last night amy was angry with me because i’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters
oh i know that now at first i thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps but it turns out no she was genuinely mortified
let me put it this way do you own a barrel and suspenders
i’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf
oh let me guess you guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms
we’re helping raj figure out his finances
well he has a job how bad can it be
well his rent and car lease are exceedingly high you couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping
wait wait not shopping for clothes right because look
he also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt
i thought your dad paid your cards
i have a card for emergencies that i pay for myself
what emergency happened at the la zoo
that’s a penguin i sponsor they’re losing their homes to global warming and my car gets like seven miles a gallon so i felt bad
it’s intimate waxing quit looking at that
maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control
no absolutely not you can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses that is a foolish expense and i forbid it
what if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives
we don’t know his mother never had him tested
you’re talking about me very funny although i would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion
wait wait who’s gonna break it to the penguin
okay sheldon yeah i’m putting you in charge of my finances i will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize
very well hey comiccon tickets go on sale this friday you can’t buy one
oh better luck next time pink cheeks
well leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him so i thought maybe this year i’d tag along
well that’s sweet i bet you’ll have fun
so do you want to come
no thanks i already live in a place all the nerds come to
please i went to your boring thing last month
come on even you checked your email during the eulogy
well i’m not going but i do think it’s nice you want to
it’s not that i want to go i just think it’ll make leonard happy and if i have to watch him squeeze into an ewok costume so be it
look at you going to comiccon talking about ewoks i really have become the cool one around here
you actually think penny will have fun at comiccon
no which will make me miserable which is usually sheldon’s job
she’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels
and hate all the crowds at the panels
she’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels
why don’t you just tell her not to come
well she’s so excited i can’t do that to her
what if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go
that i would do to her
i can’t believe penny’s gonna get to go and i’m not
you can always watch the panels online oh boy we do say that a lot
panels just wanted to be included
you put me in charge of your finances if you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over you should have asked leonard
okay you’re right i got myself into this but i’ve never missed a comiccon with you guys
your father may have spoiled you but i won’t if you want a ticket to comiccon i suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself
yeah you’re a grown man who’s highly educated you could charge people money to punch you
go ahead make jokes i don’t know why you think you’re going to comiccon you just had a baby
well so so you think bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to san diego for five days and leave her alone
hang hang on so i have to bring penny you can’t afford it howard’s gonna get in trouble and this guy gets to have a great time
oh she’s sexy she can cook i’m such a lucky guy
you want something stupid or you did something stupid
no i just walked in here saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you
oh dear god you’re cheating on me with raj
ha ha ha never gets old okay there is something i want but it’s not a big deal
well comiccon tickets go on sale this friday and i was hoping i could go with the guys but before you say anything i’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here i mean everything i’m even gonna answer for you yes howard you can go
it’s so hard to say no to you
you said tickets don’t go on sale till friday right
you said you were gonna do all this stuff for me right
see where i’m going with this
if you don’t know how to make lasagna google does
okay so this is the main comiccon floor it’s where all the vendors and exhibits are
wow that is a lot of people jammed in there
i know sometimes howard wears a striped shirt so we can play where’s wolowitz okay now this is us camping out in line for the avengers panel
oh you really sleep on the sidewalk huh
yeah it can get chilly but raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag it helps keep you warm here’s the hotel room we all share
well you and i would get our own room right
every hotel is booked but yeah see this space here between sheldon’s feet and my head that’s where you go
well it’s no different than when sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm
don’t worry we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway it’s like an allnight party there’s trivia contests and dungeons  dragons as we like to say it’s off the chain mail
i even said off the chain mail and she still wants to go
that’s probably my fault she may have heard about my cool dumbledore costume
okay i can give you 20 bucks for the whole box
but you charged me hundreds for this stuff
i know and i did it with a straight face
but i need to earn enough money so i can go to comiccon
well all right i’ll give you 25 bucks that’s my best offer
you know if you want to make extra money i could throw some work your way
great you’re hired first thing you can do is put price tags on these start the little ones at fifty
you know it’s no big deal i can put up with anything for three days
why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go
i can’t it’ll break his heart you know he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy like going outside
you know maybe it won’t be that bad leonard says it’s really mainstream now comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more i mean it is still a key part of their demographic
busy like i’ll be with the baby if you go to san diego
they complete my ensemble what do you want
i’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores i could do
hang on bernie can i outsource my chores to an indian guy
hey i was thinking if you want to do a couples costume we could paint ourselves green and be hulk and shehulk or we could paint ourselves blue and go as nightcrawler and mystique
is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint
yeah if you want us to look like losers
hey um are you sure the guys are okay with me coming
this is just something you usually do together and if i’m screwing it up i don’t have to go
oh why do you not want to go
why do you not want me to go
no i want you to go
okay good ’cause that’s what i want too
now we’re going as hulk and shehulk i don’t want to take my shirt off at comiccon
if i may speak for comiccon we don’t want that either
no but it’s honest and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship
uh it’s more complicated than that
i’m always honest with amy the other day she said she was selfconscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder and i said you know you can call that a beauty mark all you want when there’s hair growing out of it that’s a mole
do you think she’s as honest with you
i should hope so when she called me an insensitive jerk i’d like to think she meant it
there’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck
yeah you’d think ooh maybe i could sell my blood and sperm
i really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming
oh double stuffed oreos i remember when i could afford you
that’s fine she and i can cry together
i know i wish there was some way we could help him
if he could find a girl with a job all his problems would be over
yeah that’s working out great for me
penny says they’re ready to go
very well prepare for a long night of deceit
sheldon women can wear make up it’s not lying
i was talking about leonard and if make up is so truthful why is it called concealer
wait wait wait what’s leonard lying about
he doesn’t really want penny to go to comiccon he’s just doing it to make her happy
really because she doesn’t actually want to go she’s just doing it to make him happy
so they’re both trying to make each other happy and the end result is they make each other sad that’s hilarious i can’t wait to tell them
no you’re not gonna tell them anything you’re gonna stay out of it
well if you haven’t noticed i’ve been between them for the last ten years
hey babe you want to drive
no it’s fine i know you don’t like the way i drive
i don’t have a problem with your driving
are you listening to this they deceive each other about everything
just so you know that guy in the parking lot hit me
he wasn’t in a car but okay
just say you want to drive
amy do us a favour please drive
if you want to drive just drive i don’t see why this has to be so complicated
it’s not complicated amy’s driving that’s it
that’s not it because you’re clearly upset
you’re the one who seems upset
because you don’t want her to go to comiccon
this is an interesting way to stay out of it
wait you don’t want me to go
well i just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time
yeah well get this neither does penny that’s why she doesn’t want to go you set ’em up i knock ’em down good job
why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t
i just thought it would make you happy
ooookay hold on so if you don’t want to go and i don’t need to bring you is everything good
hold on i’m trying to decide if i’m mad at you no i’m happy i don’t have to go
not entirely the fight over who’s going to drive is still…
the place looks great did you guys get a maid
dinner’s almost ready if you like meatloaf i’m sure you’ll like its cousin bowl of meat
hey if you’re still looking to make money i will pay you to burn that jacket
thank you but it doesn’t look like i’m going to comiccon this year
well with as much debt as you have probably not next year either
it’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of halley you’ve done
there’s more than enough in there to cover comiccon
um i also take care of halley
and you live here for free
i do ma’am thank you ma’am
this is so generous of you i um i don’t know what to say
now you can come with us
yeah there’s room in the bed by sheldon’s feet
as much as i appreciate this i can’t accept it okay halley’s my goddaughter i don’t take care of her for money
keep it consider it a gift
hold on is it back pay or is it a gift
when the irs questions us in separate rooms we need to have our stories straight
it doesn’t matter i’m not keeping this i’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible taking handouts won’t help that
so you’re not going to comiccon
i’ve been plenty of times if i miss one it’s fine i’m a big boy
i’m a big boy and if i missed one i’d throw a bigboy tantrum
you know what i’ve gone 12 times maybe i’ll sit out this year too
yeah maybe you and i can do something fun that weekend
oh how about we compromise and go on the small world ride at disneyland
you know what i’m not gonna go either i’m a father now i’d rather spend time with my family
you just don’t want to go alone with sheldon
i’m gonna go check on dinner
sounds like everyone’s staying home what do you say
nuts to that i’m going to comiccon
not necessarily i have four months to find some new friends
that’s very kind of you stuart check back in with me in july
i’m not going with you to comiccon
what can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ballandsocket joint
he can but it’s still not changing my mind
well maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind it’s a list of this year’s panelists it’s long isn’t it
aw man did you see this post from raj
what is it another video of him and his dog ladyandthetramping some spaghetti
no he can’t afford his apartment and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live i want to say india but it seems mean
raj is looking for a cheap place to live and i wrote india
maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes fine what should we do
we’re smart i’m sure we can think of something
you want to let him live here
i know our apartment’s small but i think we can make room
no sheldon we are not getting a lifesize spiderman statue
we do have sheldon’s old room if he really needs a place to stay i guess we should offer it to him
am i still a good friend if i wait and hope that howard offers him a place to live first
i know if the roles were reversed he would do it for me
where would he stay we already have stuart
well we can make some space in the garage maybe put a cot out there get him a space heater maybe a hot plate
let’s hope he thinks so too
for the last time no hulk no batman no lifesize statues
wow i’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place
hey uh so we’ve been talking and if you need a place to stay we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you
that would be amazing i was literally just looking at my moving boxes trying to pick one to live in
i know it’s not ideal but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down
it is our pleasure beep beep beep hey can you hold on one sec hello
hey buddy you still looking for a place to live
uh yeah why do you ask
you know we have the extra bedroom and if you need it it’s yours
oh my god that’s so generous
it’s the least we can do
i really appreciate it uh can you hold on one second hey so howard what’s the bathroom situation gonna be
well there’s a sink out there that takes care of half your problems
but i can use the downstairs bathroom right
yeah we barely use it so it’ll be like it’s yours
cool cool yeah yeah hold on one second
hey what’s it like sharing a bathroom with penny is there hair everywhere does she use your loofah
okay well if i move in you can’t use mine hold on a second hey howard uh how’s the wifi in the garage
i don’t know why are you asking all these questions
well to be honest leonard’s on the other line and he offered me their spare bedroom
but you made the garage sound so fun
i just didn’t want you to feel bad about it unless leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights go there
one second okay i think we’re close how do you feel about a minifridge in my room
hey pal you want to live here or not
oh uh hi penny yes please
hi uh penny this circular is addressed to occupant but with our apartment switch it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine
okay thanks just throw it out speaking of occupants i’m given to understand raj will be moving into my old room
she’ll be in her crate it’s not a big deal
well sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs he even took a picture with pluto at disneyland
if real dogs gave me buttons i’d like them too well i think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend
and i think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication amy’s clearly giving you
and what is that supposed to mean
well it’s like that science thing for every action you have a gigantic and annoying reaction
just when i thought you couldn’t get any hotter
if you’re implying that i’d have some problem with him moving into my room you’re wrong raj is in a difficult financial situation and i’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it
do not adjust the dosage you nailed it
don’t listen to them what’s weird is that penny almost got a science fact right
i mean it’s unfair people just assume i’m going to be upset by raj moving into my old room
talk to me tell me what’s going on
well that’s been my room since before i met leonard and now someone else is going to be living in it and that someone else is not me and you know how i feel about people who aren’t me
there are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room for me too the first time you told me you loved me was in that room
wrong we were standing outside my room in the hallway
and there is the love of which i speak
i realize it’s irrational but with raj moving in there i’m feeling a bit replaced
well this isn’t an easy time for him he’s losing his apartment he’s in debt he’s probably humiliated
yes probably but until we know for sure how can i feel better
can i get anyone anything at all
raj you don’t have to serve us
it’s the least i can do for helping me carry my stuff up
not for you box of towels
hey look at that you’ve got a raj we’ve got a stuart maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together
i don’t know yours looks like he has worms
well a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present
it’s nothing like that i just i thought about raj’s situation and i had a change of heart you know and regarding your gift you said surprise me and boy did i hello
uh wait before we eat i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj
wait is anything gonna jump out of that
thank you sheldon it’s a blank notebook
well i had some of my best ideas in that room and i’m sure you will too
he also never had sex in that room that’s something else to look forward to
well i know this is a difficult time for you you’re losing your apartment you’re in debt and you just you must be humiliated
oh good grief she is such a stickler for citing sources those were amy’s words
i know i know good grief was originally said by charlie brown geez
you’re right i am humiliated thanks for pointing it out you’re such a jerk
i thought that was gonna break the other way
come on sheldon maybe we should just eat at our place
fine you took my room you turned my friends against me i hope you’re happy
what do i have to be happy about my life’s a wreck
how come he can say it and i can’t
hello sheldon what a pleasant surprise how are you
honestly i’ve been better do you have time leonard says you’re very busy these days
oh i just say that because he prattles what’s going on
well our friend raj moved into my old room and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me
mm well what do you think the loss of your room represents
beverley you know i hold you in high esteem can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer and get to the part where you tell me the answer
very well but uh if you don’t mind i’d still like to pause for effect now you’ve recently moved in with dr fowler yes
clearly your old room represents an escape hatch and without it you’re forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with amy forever
and don’t start thinking about it now
hello amy your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with sheldon
this isn’t about me and sheldon this is about rajesh moving in with leonard and penny
interesting they’ve found a need to take yet another room mate seems they’re avoiding some harsh realities themselves
i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster boy you’re good
that is the word on the street dear
maybe moving in was a bad idea i haven’t been here one day i’m already causing problems
you didn’t do anything it’s sheldon
you didn’t do anything it’s sheldon that’d make a nice needlepoint pillow
so relax we’re happy to have you
thank you but how do i know you’re not saying that just to be nice
do you actually pay for that haircut
hey raj i owe you an apology look could you please put your dog on a leash
well then at least hold her still so i can pretend she’s stuffed raj i let my emotions get the best of me and i unfairly took it out on you
no i can’t take all the credit i spoke with leonard’s mother and she made me feel better
i don’t know who you talked to but that wasn’t my mother
beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship
what are you talking about we’re fine
yes you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems it used to be me now it’s raj and his attack tribble anyway i’m sorry for everything oh and fyi if you cry while they’re fighting they’ll take you to mcdonald’s
why are you saying we have marital problems we don’t have marital problems
i see you must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss
look just because we took our friend in does not mean that penny and i are afraid to be alone
yeah this is a special circumstance
sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you as well
yeah well a circumstance can happen twice and still be special
well now that you point it out…
we do seem to keep finding room mates
dear i would never come between you and leonard that’s for your parade of room mates to do
howard howard it’s me it’s just me
well i texted you but you didn’t respond leonard and penny were arguing
it’s fine it’s just raj you can hit him with the bat but it’s fine
and if my heart stops just let me go
i’m sorry guys sheldon was upset leonard and penny were fighting i just wanted to go some place where i wasn’t causing problems
can i just stay in the garage
don’t do that we’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning
come on i’ll get you some sheets then i’ll see if i can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine
never should’ve had all these kids so close together
beverley believes i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch
yes i don’t care for unconscious thoughts my brain and i are best friends it should tell me everything
i mean how it relates to our relationship not the bromance between you and your brain
what if she’s correct doesn’t that say something troubling about us
i don’t know i just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan
that is true did you know i figured out in which order i would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse
you need to stop hanging out with your brain so much it’s not a good influence
if you’re looking for spare change i already cleaned it out
well didn’t think this is where my life would be
me either i’m in a bedroom and you’re on a couch i’m actually winning
you know we’re both down on our luck maybe you and i should try to get a place together
okay listen to me there is no reason to leave here this is great everyone’s nice it’s comfortable if all goes according to plan this is my retirement home
wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent
better than i feel in their steam shower i don’t think so
penny would be the entree then leonard’s basically a cheese course and because i love you you’re dessert
i want to say aw but i’m gonna say ew
no you see i’m doing this so i can stop being spoiled and you know grow as a person
good for you this sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it
don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends
hey look i went to art college i tried to make it as a graphic artist a comic book artist and you know what i got for my efforts a visible rib cage i’m not kidding you could see my heart beating
well no offence but i didn’t go to art school i have a phd in astrophysics
oh great it’ll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head
did you know raj moved out last night
leonard and penny i’m sorry for all the trouble i’ve caused i went to stay at howard’s ps cinnamon’s with me but if you feel like messing with sheldon tell him she’s loose in the building
should we go bring him back
well you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems
oh that was just because my mother got in my head it’s like being possessed but instead of satan it’s actually it’s the same thing
all right so we’ll ask him to come back
don’t you want to get dressed first
just one second help cinnamon’s loose in the building
we’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable we really weren’t fighting about you
i just never want to be a burden on my friends
me either don’t want to be a burden hey is that the baby i’ll go check
you are not a burden and we want you to come back and stay with us
but i also upset sheldon and he’s not gonna want to come over if i’m there
more reasons for you to stay
you know she’s at my parents’ house right
and she’s having the time of her life
if you ever want to change things up you’re always welcome here
just not in our bedroom you dumbass
i appreciate it but i think staying with leonard and penny makes more sense for everyone
and just so you know it’s only temporary i’m not gonna get too comfortable
good nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever
hey that’s no way to talk about your baby
you know what i’m proud of us yeah with penny and leonard taking in raj and stuart living with howard and bernadette we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party
you know downwardfacing dog comes from the sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana
oh that’s beautiful what does it mean
yeah i guess they don’t have sanskrit for butts up and heads down
hey we wrote the kama sutra if it involves butts there’s a word for it
i thought we were getting breakfast before work
it’s my fault i asked penny to do yoga with me
if you want i can get ready in five minutes
it’s cute that you think that don’t worry about it
hey can i ask you a favour would you mind taking cinnamon for a walk
sure you’re living here for free i guess i owe you
bye cinnamon be a good girl
things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope
oh the project is classified i can’t tell you oh i suppose i could redact the classified parts all right um i came up with an elegant solution to the honks horn i used the honks horn and then i honks horn and that did it car passes honking horn wow i wonder what they’re redacting
why don’t you ask me what i’m working on
oh very well what have you been working on and feel free to honk during the boring parts
i’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it
so you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain
yes i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place
well what do you know here i was waiting to be bored with biology and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy which unlike my body is an okay place to tickle
you know when i was six i wanted to marry the gorilla from good night gorilla maybe i was onto something
gentlemen the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon
unless it was singing be our guest i doubt it
yeah i picked it up without thinking about it which raises a neuroscientific question when did i decide to pick it up
the bigger question is what are you gonna eat with that spoon you didn’t get any food
he does raise an interesting point
amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness and i realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics now i recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you googling what it means so i’ll wait
i’m sorry i spaced are we still talking about the spoon
it’s nice to see you taking an interest in amy’s work
well don’t get me wrong neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff but you know when it connects to physics gas up the ford martha we’re going for a drive
no i was going to but she called in sick and guess who else called in sick
oh you met him at the office christmas party he’s married to nancy
i bet jennifer gets a promotion out of this which is so unfair because i work twice as hard as she does
don’t worry jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour
it didn’t work for randy it didn’t work for tina it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for jennifer
well i hope not i just hate when people play those kinds of games
with your sales record you have nothing to worry about
i went to your office christmas party
you know i like harp lessons but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons what are you working on
i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making and i realized if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation
wait are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses
it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee it was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow
yeah and this one won’t stain my teeth purple
you know we’ve never collaborated professionally before are you worried it might affect our relationship
that is a valid point perhaps we should establish some ground rules
well that would make me feel better
all right let’s start right now uh rule number one no using sexuality to get your way
i can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin
well this is a moisturizing mask
oh well then i can actually feel the moisture going into my skin
hey i hope you don’t mind i used a little of your eye cream last night
i thought someone looked brighter and tighter
i’d still like to know who jerry is
don’t worry about it hey after this how about we all go out and do something together
that would be great thank you
or we could do something we’ll all enjoy like play a board game
i believe i’ve made some progress on our ground rules
okay uh number one in matters of physics i have the final say in matters of neuroscience you have the final say unless i disagree oh here number two when we publish
oh of course i’ll get that back like all my underwear that notebook says property of sheldon cooper
sheldon if we’re gonna have ground rules i’ll tell you the first ground rule i make the ground rules
i’d write that down but i can’t now can i
i mean they didn’t say anything but i just kind of felt like i was being a weird third wheel
huh so you can tell what that feels like interesting
anyway i figured i can hang out with my friends and have fun too
well if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to target for diapers things are about to get nuts
oh it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around isn’t that right halley
well at least someone had the courage to say it
thank you you are a good citizen told you go ahead throw my underwear out the window same thing’s gonna happen
terrific do you want to hear our new set of ground rules
number one we’re on the same team we’re not in competition
that’s smart because sheldon 1 amy 0
number two disagreements can happen politely there’s no need to call an idea stupid
aw someone drew a penis in it
number three to avoid getting frustrated we take builtin breaks and reward our successes with a small treat
ooh that sounds fun now we’re talking about real treats right not bible verses like my mother used to give me
whatever you want so shall we get to work
biology and physics coming together this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind oh i know what i want my treat to be
so we’re agreed it’s complete garbage
by the way your name can go first
i mean i’m glad they’re getting along but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable
well are you worried he’s like another man in her life
a little until i saw them in matching tops
nice 174 diapers that ought to get us to wednesday
well have you talked to them about it
well what am i supposed to say stop having fun without me
this one says that every time i go out see i listen to you
look raj just gets along with women
i know but he was my friend first it’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together
you sure you don’t fit in you sound like a catty bitch to me
i don’t know where we went wrong
yeah the math is so inelegant i’m not even sure it makes sense
well don’t give up maybe we can fix it
can you stop breathing so loud i can hear your nose whistling
i can hear your face talking so we’re even
all right either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown races
fine fine you want me to blow my nose here i’ll blow it better
no i can still hear it oh wait that’s me never mind it’s fine
you know you’re exhausting i knew working together was a bad idea
hold on i see what’s wrong here we did the propagation only to the occipital lobe not to the prefrontal cortex
that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds
oh that is much better yeah boy if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose we’d be in good shape
now take a sip swirl it around your mouth and try to notice the flavours the tannins the textures well
i probably should have spit out my gum first
yeah you know the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough but uh staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it
mm well we’ve loved having you around right sweetie leonard
you know it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera
jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top
you should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with penny you don’t want to
yeah i wish i had that with howard
wait what what do i make you do
let’s see the magic store the doctor who convention the national belt buckle collector’s meet and greet
it said right there on the invitation buckle up for fun it’s not my fault you didn’t listen
you’re entitled to feel how you feel if you don’t like it you should just talk to her
i don’t want to sound like a jealous baby
oh then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her
i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive
just because i am easily bothered by light heat sound smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i’m sensitive
hey i wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex
that is a daring and insightful solution
we’re finally making progress i wish we could do it without fighting
what if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress
i suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fightorflight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes
well if that’s the case then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture
how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey wait a second wait delta t could equal alpha subzero
it seems we have a choice to make abandon all ground rules in the name of science or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship
name calling that is perfect now when i get to this equation here really let me have it you know if it helps i’m not the sharpest dresser
anyway i know it’s silly but since raj moved in i’ve been feeling a little left out
no no penny don’t dismiss his feelings
hang on i’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy i just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place
well why wouldn’t this be a safe place i mean he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends
i don’t want to speak for leonard
but when you’re insecure no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe
yeah you’re right you know you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff
well i mean i’m sitting right here you’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation
i’m sorry what did you want to say
i don’t know you pretty much covered it
revised ground rule number one we are on the same team but it is a competition
excellent excellent and on a related point you’re going down punk
revised ground rule number two there are definitely stupid questions and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face
thanks babe number three fair topics for insult include educational pedigree scientific field intellectual prowess and mamas
yeah that list is strong like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors
hey leonard if you’re not busy tomorrow i have to do a little reception after work
oh i would but we need to make a push on the air force project
oh are you sure we’re celebrating our new add drug and it’ll probably be over in like six minutes
did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow
well sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project
we’ve had this planned for a week
well he reconfirmed with me this morning
guys before this gets ugly remember the winner gets sheldon
hey raj do you want to go with me tomorrow
are you asking because you want me there or out of pity actually never mind don’t answer i’d love to
why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow
but you said you were working with me
uhoh someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom
i have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously and for your information the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech is nerd prom
i’m sorry what is this plan you have
well i’m not needed at both places at the same time and i can also free up extra hours with simple tricks such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point
soon see i could’ve said in the near future but i didn’t say in the near future because in the near future is three more words than soon in one the two near three future four see in the near future is four soon is just one four is more than one saving time already
genius i was gonna say why does anyone think sheldon’s a genius but i didn’t
gentlemen i’ve got amy up and running shall we get to work
uh before we do what are you wearing oh friend who we pretend is normal
these are hydration backpacks for efficiency whenever i’m thirsty i have access to water when i’m hungry i have lentil soup
anyway sheldon we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryocooler or through the vacuum filter
run down the pros and cons of each for me
well if we run the xenon stream through the cryocooler it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction
you can just feel the time being saved
ah i’m back you got me for eight minutes
sheldon this is silly you can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this
the coefficient isn’t lambda it’s lambda sub one and over here you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states and lastly do you have any little soup crackers
the rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second
it can’t be four revolutions it’s got to be seven
seven look at the board it’s four
son of a bitch it’s five and a half
brb that’s short for be right back i’m saving so much time
the two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and t equals zero and i know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup
incredible sheldon i didn’t expect that you could work on both projects but i i was wrong
you know i felt the same way about the spork uh solids and liquids handled by one utensil that’ll never work spoiler works
i got to admit we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once
yeah i felt the same way about the platypus you know bird and mammal in the same creature no way and spoiler way
oh thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night
actually if i could if i could just check one more…
you’re a good woman what you working on
trying to catch up on office emails before i go back
oh that’s right maternity leave’s almost over ah you excited
yeah i mean i’ll miss halley but it’ll be nice to get out of the house be intellectually stimulated go out to lunch instead of you know be lunch
yeah i mean with you and my parents she’s gonna be fine
and that day care is great
it is i went to check it out and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows
plus i i think i’m setting a good example for halley to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers sure she won’t know where i went or if i’m ever coming back that’ll just make the ten minutes between when i get home and her bedtime even more special
uh other than burp you or give you a bottle i don’t know what to do right now
it’s okay i’m just being emotional about this can you not tell howard
well don’t you think it’d be healthier if you told him what’s going on with you
don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment grown man
your secret is safe with me
hey since when do you do laundry on a thursday
oh i had an accident at work i slipped and fell on my soup sack
you know there was a time i would say what’s a soup sack but i’m glad we’re past that sheldon sneezes you know there was a time i would say god bless you and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity how about thor and i would say how do you know i didn’t mean thor and then you would say touché and that there ends the tale of why i no longer say
well we have had some fun haven’t we
oh yeah so leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day
hmm oh i did it hasn’t stopped i figured out a solution for our navigation system while i was presoaking lentils out of my pants
of course not i’m too busy to be sick
well you’re pretty delicate maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard
all right well we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching frozen
you also got a nosebleed watching up
stuart you didn’t have to make dinner
yeah well i felt bad about upsetting you this morning and to be honest i’m not the biggest fan of your meatloaf
oh cool hey i was thinking maybe we take halley to the zoo this weekend get in a little family time before you go back to work
speaking of which for day care it’ll be easy for me to drop her off unless you want to do it
hmm guess it should be me
i can’t do it they have a picture of me on file now
well i don’t know you seem a little upset
why don’t you think she’s fine she sounds fine she looks fine if i saw her on the street i’d say damn that girl’s fine
sheldon you’re sick go back to bed
i am fine here eat your toast sneezes sorry
it’s okay now i don’t need butter
well perhaps i am a little under the weather it’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix
what i need is to get to work
well i don’t want your germs around me
what you hold my hand you kiss my mouth but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever what happened to our love
what’s going on how’d i get here
i don’t know we came home from work and we found you
home from work what time is it
nine o’clock what happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks
well i remember waking up in the morning amy rubbing vicks on my chest and her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra i took some cold medicine to… i took cold medicine
you did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab
at at the lab why am i naked from the waist down
i don’t know where your pants are but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove
my pants are missing i don’t remember anything penny this is your youth what do i do
i don’t know check your body for tattoos
leonard would you be a lamb
wait wait where’s my bag my phone and my wallet are in my bag
where’s my notebook my notebook’s gone oh no
okay it’s just a notebook what’s the big deal
what’s the big deal it’s full of classified information about the air force project
it’s okay i’m sure we’ll find it
look it’s got to be around here somewhere
maybe it’s wherever your pants are
nope pants in the microwave no notebook
look something’s going on with bernadette she say anything to you
come on be honest did you tell her i tried her breast pump
no but i did mention it to my therapist
well i know she’s mad at me about something
well what have you done that would upset her
oh gosh how much time do you have
well why don’t you just start with the worst thing
hmm let’s see mm okay here we go six years ago i got a call that bernie’s greataunt trixie died
and i forgot to give her the message
the terrible part is ever since then i’ve been sending bernie christmas cards from trixie
let me finish and one card had five dollars in it i took from bernie’s purse
the notebook isn’t in the bathroom
i can’t find it either how can he not remember a day
well people who are abducted by aliens lose time i mean maybe it happens to the aliens too
well it’s not across the hall
that’s it i’m in breach of my security clearance i’m going to prison and you know what happens to people like me in prison i’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor
but boy it is funny to think about
wait a minute hey let me see your phone
well it’s it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went
yeah it depends on the privacy settings
oh that that’s so cool how do you how do you turn that thing off
relax i know when you go for a run you stop for a donut
i don’t even run there i drive
hang on i can see every place you went
uh you were in the building you were at the university then you were somewhere on colorado boulevard
wait hang on did you go to a cowboy bar
i no that is preposterous maybe

no what is wrong with you
aha you are upset i don’t know a lot about women but i know i upset them
howard i’m sorry if i’m being weird but it has nothing to do with you
no i didn’t want to tell you but i’m having a really tough time about going back to work
oh okay well i get that it was hard for me when i went back
of course i missed you and the baby and being able to watch ellen every day
i just don’t know what the right thing to do is if i go back to work i’m abandoning halley if i don’t go i’m giving up everything i worked for it’s like there’s no right choice
look i don’t know what the best decision is either but whatever we choose if we’re not happy we can undo it
and the best part is halley won’t remember a thing babies are cute but they’re dumb i mean i go like this she thinks i’m gone then magically i’m back i mean honestly why are we saving for college
i’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb
you gonna buy another round for the house
uh no thank you we now know why mastercard sent me a fraud alert
um yes howdy partner do you happen to recollect if i left a notebook in these here parts
it’s called fitting in by the way good luck

weiches kätzchen warmes kätzchen das nie und nimmer murrt liebes kätzchen müdes kätzchen schnurrt schnurrt schnurrt
all right we’re about to go live everyone on their agame good energy hello i’m dr sheldon cooper
and i’m dr amy farrah fowler
and welcome to a special retrospective where we will take a look back at the history of fun with flags on an episode we’re calling…
you’ll need a good attention span
it’s fun with flags behind the flags a retrospective flags
mind you when we say behind the flags we don’t literally mean these flags that’s just where we have dinner
now i’m sure many of you are wondering how fun with flags began
so let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start how howard flashback sounds
could have played that on my harp
just roll the clip on voiceover so tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born
sure you do i was telling you both the story about how haiti and lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag it was at the summer olympics of 1936 and two plucky nations…
oh and do you remember what you said
yes please find someone who cares
and that’s exactly what i did i found a lot of someones
almost 200 many of them on purpose
and now we’re going to turn it over to you the viewers to call in and share your favourite fun with flags moments
and don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed just keep trying long pause oh thank god welcome to fun with flags
hey sheldon hey amy it’s bert
hello bert what is your flagrelated comment or query
and what does that have to do with flags
nothing i just wanted everyone to know i have a girlfriend
bert you’re tying up the line my apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments
ooh ooh all right we have our next caller
should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo oh howie i don’t need food as long as i can look at my phone
i don’t like when you imitate me
you want to hear my stuart it’s been a while since i’ve gone on a date you mind if we watch the monkeys doing it
i said that to you in confidence
this is supposed to be our family fun day what’s so important on your phone
i’m on the day care’s website
stop looking at that the day care’s great it’s on campus my office is two minutes away there’s nothing to worry about
what if she likes the people who work there more than us
she already likes soap bubbles more than us
when i go back to work we’re gonna leave her with these people we don’t know anything about them
they’re highlytrained educators with background checks they’re even required to be current on all vaccinations
you leave her with me and i’m not any of those things
oh let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get i’ll go first okay here uh heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer and the policeman says did you know you were going 85 miles per hour and heisenberg says darn it now i don’t know where i am
ahahah he’s a geologist and i have more physics jokes
so sheldon says you have a new girlfriend
yeah which he rudely announced on my flag show people were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night
sorry i couldn’t help myself i guess i just love love
well i’m very happy for you
hey we’re all having dinner tonight why don’t the two of you join us
hold on we don’t know anything about this woman
what do you want to know
oh great see you at seven
how about after this we go see the exotic bird show
not a good idea my hair is a coveted nesting material
well sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year i’m going back to work after only four months so i’ve learned i hate myself i hate sloths and i hate you for bringing me here
me i get but that sloth is pretty cute
it’s not just the sloth polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months the orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night and what do i do i choose my career over my child
told you we should have gone to legoland
can’t believe bert has a girlfriend and i don’t
i thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career
don’t you have any friends he can date
hey i already set up howard and bernadette it’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life
she’s younger and far more attractive than he is they’re copying you two
chicken birds mess with my hair i come back hard
yeah eventually she’s still not happy about taking a bottle though
look if you’re not ready to go back to work we’ll figure something out
it might be good for her howard’s mother was around him all the time and he’s a worldclass mama’s boy
i mean why would you say that
go ahead have a tantrum that’ll prove me wrong
it would be nice to raise halley to be a little more independent than you were
i guess it wasn’t until college that i learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth
on that charming note dinner is served
so is this your first time dating a scientist ‘cause i’m thinking of starting a support group
actually i’m not new to this i was engaged to a scientologist
bert rebecca i’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier
don’t worry about it it’s fine
see it was fine i didn’t need a timeout
it wasn’t a timeout let’s get some food
you made me sit on the stairs and think about what i did
so how did you two meet
oh it’s such a cute story we met on a dating web site
that’s nice i haven’t had much success meeting people online
i didn’t either until i revamped my profile
what’d you do delete your photo
and don’t you slam that door
 bert you were telling us how you updated your profile
right i wasn’t getting any responses and then i added recent 625000 macarthur grant winner and five minutes later i met my soul mate
i was wrong you can come back in
so rebecca how did you become a personal trainer
i came to los angeles to be an actress and things didn’t really work out
i’d say she’s copying you again but i’m getting tired of sitting in the hall
i’d love a personal trainer i haven’t seen my abs since they opened a shake shack on my drive home
i could give you some free sessions
oh is that offer for everybody
she’s so perfect sometimes i think she isn’t real and then she goes to the bathroom and i know she is
i’m sorry bert but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money
she better be on our first date i bought her an 80inch flatscreen
your first date did you even measure her walls
you know on our first date leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel
and we lived happily ever after
well guess i’m ready to go
have a great first day back
you have everything she needs for day care
okay okay sweetie mommy’s gonna go to work now so you have fun today
i told her if day care is anything like prison find the biggest baby and knock him out
bye cutie i’m gonna miss you i’m gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home
stop you’re gonna make me cry
she’s not gonna see us all day and she doesn’t even care
okay so feynman einstein and schrodinger walk into a bar feynman says it appears
you should send that to jimmy fallon
hey yeah hey sorry if last night was awkward
actually it got me thinking that i shouldn’t flaunt my money to find love i might break up with rebecca
i think it shows a lot of character
i’m gonna hold out and see if i can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me
that’s a good one okay now leonard you tell a joke
i see a wall floor some asian baby there she is
thank you okay i’m gonna try and get some work done
can’t a guy hang out at a college he doesn’t go to and stare at a baby that isn’t his
i get it i haven’t even made it to my office yet
is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day
yeah or we could take her to the aquarium
i’ll get her you grab her bag
hang on halley we’re busting you out of there
comments from our behind the flags retrospective get this people are calling it the longest one yet
oh you know good for you
no i miss her i don’t know why i listened to you
he’s not wrong it was your crackpot idea that he deserves love
you know you need to start raising your hand before you speak yes starting now
bert you’re a good guy you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money
she was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear now the only one doing that is me
if you’re that upset go get her back
i tried she’s not answering my calls which really hurts because i bought her that phone i made a huge mistake
no you didn’t okay look bert when i had money i dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me and then i gave up my money and now i’m alone and living with my friends and somebody else should probably talk now
look sweetie relationships aren’t about money okay it’s about respect and having things in common and… yes sheldon
you and leonard don’t have anything in common maybe you should break up
guess who’s home from day care
it’s halley unless somebody else put an x on the bottom of their kid’s foot
you realize they called when you took her
guess who’s home from the aquarium
you don’t have to go you’re welcome to hang with us
actually our friendship group is at capacity but if anybody drops out you’re at the top of the list unless it’s raj in which case we’ll probably get a person of colour
you guys are nice but i’m just gonna buy rebecca a jet ski and see if that gets her back
so he’s using his money to attract a mate is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract amy or leonard using his power of grovelling to get penny
it’s totally different bert’s money might run out but i can beg until the end of time
all that and he’s shorter than me
sheldon what did amy have that attracted you
oh so many things her mind her kindness and especially her body
relax we’re the same blood type he knew he could harvest an organ
see this is the right thing for her let’s all just go to work
let me just say goodbye halley look at mommy over here honey say goodbye to mommy look at me look at your mother all right we can go
and i’m dr amy farrah fowler
based on the glowing reception of our recent behind the flags retrospective we thought you might like to see how it all came together
ooh we already have our first call
oh hello you’re on fun with flags
the jet ski worked i got her back
sheldon get over here and help
sheldon why are you jumping up and down
then use the shoot button not the wonderful thing about tiggers button
doing it right now oh they can’t there’s an important little league game tomorrow
no wonder they beat us they’re jocks
what happened to me i used to excel at these things
kids are always better at video games
mm if it makes you feel better you still dress like a child
no but it’s not just video games i downloaded the new os for my phone took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone
oh so our love is not real
well i know how you feel i tried one of those electronic japanese toilets practically shot myself across the room
i guess i just need to face it i’m no longer a wunderkind now i just wonder what’s for lunch
i didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding
yeah they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production
i’m pretty sure that’s a myth let me check
ruin it for me and i’ll break this glass over your head
ooh i’m gonna get another you want food
yeah breastfeeding burns like 5000 calories a day do not touch that phone
what are the odds of running into you here
well it’s a bar so pretty good uh what’s new
oh tons of stuff put artificial grass in my backyard got engaged had a scary mole that turned out to be sharpie
no on on getting engaged good for you
oh thanks how about you hey how’s leonard is he still smart
yes yes he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope of course the first time i say it right he’s not even here
i love that little guy hey we should all have dinner sometime
uh yeah sure i’ll check with leonard
cool i’ll check with sara sara pull up my calendar it never works for me
i’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation
you’re gonna have to be more specific
at the hands of those teenagers
oh the video game yeah that was bad
i started doing some reading on cognitive vitality and i came across an area of research called superaging
you know who’s a superager jennifer lopez like what is her secret
now this is rare i don’t know which one of you i want to stop talking first
the theory is that if you really tax your brain the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous
boy it is neck and neck right now
how is superaging any different than like doing crossword puzzles
well it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks you need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion
i drive you to work every day my brain must look like the hulk
if you really want to challenge yourself you could learn to speak hindi
jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha i did that when i was eight
could you say that in english i actually i never learned hindi
honestly it’s a little strange having dinner with your exboyfriend and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about
what he loves you okay and he’s interested in your work you could talk about the infinite perspective… i swear i know it
it’ll be fine let’s just go
well and his fiancée will be there so you know if the conversation lags we can talk about their wedding
come on i spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for deadpool 2
ha i knew you weren’t asleep
oh she couldn’t make it she had an emergency
raj is teaching me to make croissants
is this part of your superaging
yes yeah it seemed daunting at first but then i realized it’s like the chemistry set i had as a kid only when your brother eats this no one has to call poison control
okay shall we oh my god it’s light it’s flaky it’s buttery you don’t need to have sex with him just eat one of these
yes it is delicious physicist baker lover what can’t i do
well clearly mental tasks are not enough maybe you need to challenge your motor skills
for the last time i am not having a tickle fight with you
you want a real challenge try keeping me from eating more of these
you’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever
damn it he’s good at that too
thanks wow working on a top secret government project that is so cool do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away
i have sheldon that keeps most people away
i miss that guy he’s like the swedish chef muppet i don’t know what he’s saying but he’s funny
oh i know what he’s saying and he’s not he’s not funny
so penny what’s going on with you how’s the job
uh it’s okay i’m still in pharmaceutical sales
she’s doing amazing she can actually make a side effect like 10 chance of liver failure sound like a 90 chance of liver success
yeah lying isn’t my favourite part of the job actually i’m not crazy about a lot of it
hey if you’re not happy there i’ve been looking for a new head of sales at my company and we don’t sell drugs just menus so the only lie you’ll be telling is we print on recycled paper we don’t
you know we’d make a great team or as we say in the menu business i can’t do this without me n u
yeah right it’s funny i got a lot of menu jokes but that’s my favourite
all right this is everything what do you want to learn
it really doesn’t matter as long as it’s challenging
okay well how about oh i teach you some closeup magic
howard i’m trying to make myself uncomfortable not everyone else
so you wanted to learn something physical and you came to howard wolowitz
hey the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding have you ever tried to juggle
yes i’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now
and it’s hard isn’t it so the key is the moment one ball is at the top of its arc you toss the next one hmm
okay i think i got that
uh hold on there’s an old saying in juggling
is it i’m going to die alone
no it’s if you want to have fun start with one yours we think but we do not say all right just toss it up and catch it a few times get comfortable with it
okay just to be on the safe side am i in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow
are you sure ‘cause i’m feeling a twinge
see that wasn’t so bad he even picked up the check
yeah although when he was trying to figure out the tip i’m pretty sure i saw smoke coming out of his ears you’re not really considering working for him are you
well maybe i mean it seems kind of perfect i have sales experience and i’ve been a waitress so i have restaurant experience and if he’s figuring out my christmas bonus we could buy a boat
don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date
you work with sheldon you tell me
okay are you seriously jealous of me working with zack
no no i’m not jealous i just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your coworkers
great so you want me to stay at a job i’m not happy at
you okay you kind of look like zack trying to figure out that tip
of course i don’t want you to be unhappy but i also want you to be smart and working for an exboyfriend isn’t very smart you don’t have to stop just slow down i’ll jump out
amy look i’m on a unicycle
how did you get from croissants to a unicycle
howard said i could borrow it bernadette said forever
have you tried letting go of the rope
what are you crazy i’m on a unicycle
wait i need help getting down
well what do you want me to do
drag out our mattress and put it over here then go across the hall get their mattress and put it over here but before you do any of that scratch my nose
so you told her she was being dumb
no i told her she was being not smart which was dumb
why did you even go to dinner with the guy
so he’s my exboyfriend who cares i can’t believe leonard would be so insecure
really i have no trouble believing that at all
and zack’s engaged leonard has no reason to feel threatened
we’re talking about the same leonard right
so you think it’s fine if she works for zack
well he is much more attractive than leonard
yes but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for
yeah but she also used to sleep with zack
i would never let howard work with an ex
i wouldn’t trust her he’s thin and sexy like a jewish greyhound
yeah that that is the sexiest dog
and i’d like to think howie wouldn’t take a job i was uncomfortable with
you know what i’m with leonard this isn’t cool
i disagree penny is a strong independent woman the more you try to control her the more she’ll push back
oh no she’s gonna leave you for someone might as well get it over with
i’m returning this stuff to howard
oh well bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it we’d give it to a homeless clown what happened to learning the unicycle
oh i stopped that it was dumb uni bi tri menstrual all cycles are dumb
you said juggling was dumb too
well it is if i wanted to hold three things at once i’d wear cargo pants
sheldon is it possible that when things get really difficult you just give up
are you calling me a quitter
his mother warned me everybody warned me actually he warned me
that doesn’t seem to be where i shine how about i just give you one of these
look we can have a reasonable conversation and i won’t get mad i don’t like it after sex and i don’t like it now
yeah all right just come here look i get me working with zack is weird and i don’t want you to be uncomfortable
well thanks and i don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like
well i don’t love it but if you really want to take this job i’ll find a way to deal with it
no i know you’ll try but it’ll make you miserable which will make me miserable and i’m just gonna stay where i’m at for now
no no no no you’re you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay and it’s fine i’ll just i’ll suck it up
you don’t need to do that it’s okay
yeah see now i feel terrible like i’m being selfish and holding you back what say something yeah that is pretty annoying
i’m sorry i called you a quitter
it’s okay i stopped being upset about that and no the irony is not lost on me
this article says the peak age for making a nobel prizewinning discovery is 40
so i’m running out of time
that’s ridiculous you’re a brilliant man the best years of your life are still ahead of you
oh you have to say that you’re sweet on me
well if you’re really worried about your career maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books
hey i thought you were sweet on me
okay fine let’s say you never win a nobel prize let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man wouldn’t that be a life welllived
you’re so cute i’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts
okay are you sure about this
absolutely i just want you to be happy and maybe a little turned on about how selfless i’m being
hey uh so i’ve been thinking about it and i want to take the job
oh bad news when my fiancée found out that i was offering a job to my exgirlfriend she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me
nope just a little bump on my forehead
okay thanks anyway bye well his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid you were right i was wrong aren’t you gonna say anything
not if i want to be doing this later
hey i didn’t know you were home where you been
i went to see your mom
i just told you your mom’s
well since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing i got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid
she didn’t say much of anything but she said a lot through ventriloquist’s doll hi bernadette remember me
first of all that’s not what she sounds like she’s from south carolina
i can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist
okay it’s not like i wanted to be a ventriloquist i was in beauty pageants and i needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant
well since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff you know maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper
no and the little lady has a name
tammy jo st cloud oh and i’m a dork for juggling
sorry you’re not a dork through doll you’re a clown bernadette tammy jo don’t say that you’ll make him feel bad doll look at him what reason he got to feel good
don’t listen to her she’s been in a box for like 25 years doll yeah back when his haircut was fashionable
oh big daddy i don’t think so you marry miss bernie you marry me we all family now
all right you’re freaking me out
don’t be that way if you don’t mind a few splinters we can have us a ménage à trois ooh
i’m doing it i’m doing it i’m tall and i’m doing it waking up in bed ah man
and for the world’s tallest second grader apple juice
thank you no bendy straw some party
hey a toast thank you all for your support while we worked on our air force project and please know that we could not have done it without you so cheers
you know it’s nice of you to acknowledge us but this is your accomplishment
yeah you guys did this all on your own
phase two we test it perfect it and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us
yeah i’ll definitely live long enough vitamin c
first thing tomorrow morning we’re back at it
i hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie he’s kind of a bummer
hmm i don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas it makes me feel special now before we field test i think we…
who else has access to this room
it’s a secure lab in a classified facility only the us government and us
but the movie did just get good
sir i i i’m sorry but i just don’t get it you came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us
but why would you do that
you guys completed phase one we’ll take it from here
wait so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside
i’m sorry to hear that as you know the primary focus of the united states military is people’s feelings
if that’s sarcasm please save it for our enemies
i may be moving out soon i think i found a place to live
oh i’m sorry to hear that
really you kept sending me apartment listings
um well i yeah you got me
bert has a room for rent
so you’re gonna be roommates with bert
uh no it’s uh pretty private actually it’s over his garage so the only time i’ll see him is when he pulls his car in does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room
well good for you i actually have a little news myself
okay we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out okay that’s cool
i was uh asked to be a visiting researcher at princeton
thanks but the thing is i’ll be gone for a few months and i don’t know how sheldon’s gonna feel about that
oh come on he’s a grown man he can take care of himself
how can you work on something for a year and they just take it
i can’t believe the air force would treat us like that
you know i have a good mind to stop paying my taxes it’s too bad i enjoy doing them so much the air force did it again they’re erasing our lives
although if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear it’d be penny
she might disappear but she’s definitely not cleaning anything
you won’t believe it the military confiscated our project
you’re kidding why would they do that
i feel so betrayed you know all my life i thought uncle sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents turns out he’s the other kind
thank you can we just talk about something else
yeah what’s going on with you guys
yeah um raj is moving out
want me to put on some neil diamond that always makes you feel better
no then you’ll get all sexed up and i’m not in the mood i mean an entire year wasted
you might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year
oh yeah yeah we brought life into the world
really that’s the importance you put on us having a baby
i’m happy about it but i mean it’s not like i did much i mean after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you
so did you tell him about princeton yet
no i’m waiting till he’s in a good mood
oh sweetie you might not live that long
i don’t know maybe i shouldn’t go
oh stop it he’ll be fine
i guess and he’ll have you and leonard right across the hall the whole time
i apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time
not really apparently grief can make one less regular
oh i’m sorry to hear that
no i sat and i sat but to no avail
oh the more details the more sorry well maybe this’ll cheer you up i made your favorite oatmeal plain
no occasion i just wanted to do something nice for you
you’re so kind you know i don’t know how i ever got by without you
oh that’s sweet but you you did just fine on your own
well i thought that too but i’ve come to realize i am completely dependent on you
no to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me mmm tasteless how do you do it
you know what you need to do is put this air force project behind you and just dive into something new
well there is our quantum cognition experiment you and i could spend more time on that
oh i don’t know i mean let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality i mean what will we have really accomplished you know a loaf of bread’s still three bucks
i’m confused you’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me
that is true i have said that
well a lot it’s very annoying has something changed um is there something that you’re not telling me
i was offered a summer research fellowship at princeton
princeton a fine institution the place where albert einstein taught and where leonard got his phd so it may have gone downhill
well i haven’t accepted it yet i wanted to talk to you first
what is there to talk about you have to take it it’s important
thank you but i’ll be fine
yes i may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend but i still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company although thanks to your high fibre breakfast i’m sure that’ll be leaving me too
really he doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it
i don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story
i mean i like a little brown sugar
i don’t know sheldon’s so vulnerable right now
oh come on look if the roles were reversed he’d be on the first train to new jersey or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one
well distance might be nice the last time a big project ended for howie he wouldn’t stop following me around he even went with me to get a mammogram
no he wanted to get one with me like some kind of weird couple’s massage
and yet you bore his child neato
you’re excited about this opportunity right
of course i get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…
okay a simple yes will do
i know but what if sheldon…
okay listen to me your relationship can handle being long distance for a while it’s not like you two are very physical
hey you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors
i’m telling you if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it
you left something at home a big hug
i found it right next to these kisses
it’s too late for me save yourself
so are you excited to have your own place again
i am but i’ll miss you guys
you could try saying that without smiling
i’m trying this is the best i can do what are you doing
what does it look like i’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart
i got the blues my baby done left me
come on sheldon amy’s only gone for a few months and now that i’m moving out your old room is empty so you can stay there whenever you want
uh could i talk to you in the hall for a sec
am i yesterday i had an air force project a girlfriend who lived with me and my good friend raj right across the hall
do you really care about that last one
no but that list was sounding a little thin
instead of dwelling on the negative think about this your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend
all right let me start again uh you and amy…
can i get my stuff sounds like it’s gonna be a while
ooh sounds serious have i been a bad boy am i gonna get a spanking ’cause you know
just listen i don’t know if you realize this but whenever you’re between projects you tend to get a little insecure
oh oh oh okay stop stop i love when you’re affectionate but this is not coming from a good place
well excuse me but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the fda shut down your project
i signed us up for ballroom dance class
okay and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team
i made us have a baby
and now the movie just got rated r
no but you are so i got you this as a present
no it is leonard pointed out to me that i’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend so here’s some quality luggage
the salesman said it could survive a plane crash so perhaps you should fly inside it
does this mean you’re okay with me going
well i’m not looking forward to it but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it besides princeton is in new jersey so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay uh i know it’s not your birthday but if you’re interested…
okay oh and just to be clear i’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going
well no it’s just i’m just warning you you know if you find yourself 3000 miles away and craving a hit of this you know i can’t skype it to you
that’s a risk i’m willing to take
all right then let’s go to the bedroom remove our clothes fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking
what if we don’t fold our clothes at all
or what if we fold them
as soon as i have the place set up i’m gonna have you guys over
i really can’t thank you enough for taking me in you know i was in a pretty low place in my life
anyway uh as i was saying i was at a pretty low place in my life and uh if it wasn’t for friends
my goodness that form of stimulation is highly efficient
i can’t compete with that bye
should we give them their privacy
i want to but i don’t think i can
okay the car is waiting do you want to walk me downstairs
of course here here let me i’ve been doing a little research on new jersey and i was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod
hmm yes yeah perhaps i’ve been harder on them than they deserve
do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while
it’s hard to say i’ve never really lived by myself what if i become strange and eccentric
i’ll love you no matter what
howard hughes saved his urine in milk bottles
we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it
and you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport
and when you’re at the gate
and if you see any actors from game of thrones in first class
i don’t know what they look like but sure
and don’t forget to skype me when you arrive
now of course my 9am is your noon so let’s avoid the whole good morning good afternoon minefield and let’s just say hello
and just remember i am proud of you and i support you in all that you do
thank you that means a lot
oh and one last thing if you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me as tall as me and has hair like thor well then i want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately
pretty well princeton has a beautiful campus
now i’ve learned some fun facts about new jersey to help you make small talk would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate they’re both shocking
actually i want to hear about you how are things at home
well i’m a lot less likely to see an eastern goldfinch or be murdered i’ll tell you that
it’s so strange earlier today i ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar
i’m sorry you had to go through that
in fact that’s when i started to really miss you
you know you just split an infinitive
did i are you gonna teach me a lesson
i am it is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem
what are you gonna do about it
that’s the only kind of admonishing i do
how’s sheldon doing with amy gone
well the last three nights i’ve had to take him to get a haircut to the train store and to a walgreens in arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen now ask me how i’m doing with amy gone
if you’d like we can help you out
i mean not me i’ve got a wife and child but this one posts video of himself flossing on instagram
it was a tutorial and yes i’m happy to keep sheldon company
great tonight he wants to look at ladders at home depot
oh why does he need a ladder
he doesn’t he just likes looking at them bring a book
gentlemen you may remember dr nowitzki she’s back at caltech for her postdoc
hi oh let me bring a chair for you
oh thanks dr nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at cern and she brought me this dutyfree toblerone
a stranger just lured sheldon away with a candy bar
wait isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around
oh yeah back before he hit puberty and grew man parts
so what do you guys think that’s about
so tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment
not ’til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory
oh you must be one of those dessert before dinner people
he just made her laugh something’s wrong
do you see the way she’s looking at him
yeah like bernadette used to look at me
i keep telling you close the bathroom door
ah did you see that she just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away what is happening
okay the simplest explanation is usually the right one
not only did they eat together leonard said he made her laugh
that’s nothing howie said she touched his hand
i cannot believe leonard mentioned the toblerone but left that part out
i don’t know we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing
i guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl
yeah do you think living with amy has somehow stirred up sheldon’s sexual appetite
ugh how can you think that why would you even put those words together
all right then we agree he’s not making any moves it’s this dr ramona chick
nowitzki i googled her she’s pretty cute
really all i got from leonard was the toblerone bar had nuts
and get this i saw an articulating ladder with dualleg leveling which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain
yeah raj made the funniest joke he said which is the best ladder to use to hang myself
so you’re keeping busy you’re not lonely
oh not at all i’ve had outings with leonard and raj in the evening and oh i had lunch
oh dr nowitzki is a woman
oh really uh when did you meet her
many years ago back when she was a grad student she’s always been a huge fan of my work and now she’s doing research at caltech
yes i think you’d like her she’s extremely intelligent just like you unlike you she’s tall blonde and used to be an olympic swimmer
that’s terrific i’ll call you right back
i gave you one job keep an eye on him how hard is that
we thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic
we didn’t want you to worry
no come on it’s sheldon nothing is gonna happen
that’s what you said to me when i started dating him and then five years later bingo bango something happened
yeah but you’re gonna be back in three months
you don’t get it i’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time all she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries
well what do you want us to do
i don’t know might be the new jersey talking but this nowitzki broad needs to disappear
that’s ridiculous as far as we know all that happened is two scientists had lunch
yeah but one of those scientists is a tall blonde olympic swimmer
come on looks don’t matter to sheldon because he only has eyes for you
it’s unbelievable sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me
penny laid into me too apparently i’m overly fixated on premium swiss chocolate bars
can you even eat those things
if i take a lactaid a halfhour before and some pepto right after
sounds like a lot of work
guys focus should we do something about nowitzki
uh well she’s single so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes then we know she’s not into sheldon
no offence stuart but the woman’s a doctor
so doctors like me whenever i see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look
she’s not that kind of doctor
oh well her loss i’ve been called a genuine medical oddity
actually i was going to suggest me
excuse me they took out my spleen and gallbladder not my feelings
dr nowitzki good to see you
we should call guinness that might be a record
she’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone
i could have made her very happy
you kept walking i think you did
do you really think there’s reason to worry
yeah she’s definitely going after sheldon
i made a play for her and she shot me down
all right well that doesn’t prove anything
yeah there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot raj down
the point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting
hey everybody this is my friend dr nowitzki
and you actually got in a pool
i was scared but i told myself it’s just a big bathtub then i got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub
i was proud of him a lot of people don’t put their face in the water on the first day
well i was hiding from a bee but it still counts
can i just squeeze in here
so sheldon have you talked to amy
yes we skyped this morning and i’m sure i’ll check in with her before i go to sleep
sheldon talks about her all the time i can’t wait to meet her
that is true she keeps asking how long amy’s going to be gone
uh so ramona tell us about yourself do you do you have a boyfriend
leonard your wife is sitting right here what are you doing
no my work doesn’t leave me a lot of time for relationships
i think you made that very clear
she was part of the american team at cern
i had a front row seat when they detected the higgs boson
do you know i’ve corresponded with peter higgs would you like to see some of his letters
well hang on i’ll come with you
oh fun like a play date
okay correct me if i’m wrong but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening
i threw my body at them what else did you want me to do
you think you should call amy
you got fingers and a mouth you call her
are these all from peter higgs
hmm oh no no no they’re from many famous people see oh like this one this is from patrick stewart it says if i come to his house again i get to meet his dogs oh excuse me
i miss you too hey this is good timing remember that dr nowitzki i told you about she’s right here
uhhuh hang on answering phone hello a little late leonard sorry
what is leonard doing calling you at this hour
i must tell you that seems a little inappropriate don’t you agree
all right this is making me crazy somebody’s got to go over there
you got feet and legs you do it
to do what shake a can of nickels at them
we’re being ridiculous there’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce sheldon cooper
you done trying to make yourself feel better
no i haven’t played the race card yet
hey i hate to break up the party but amy says i’m tired and have to go to bed
it was nice seeing everybody thank you for dinner
pardon i just need to yeah
that was fun it was like mario kart
what is this about leonard and amy i don’t like it either
okay i know you don’t have a lot of experience with women but ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you
that doesn’t make any sense she knows i have a girlfriend
well sometimes women don’t care sometimes it makes them want a guy even more
that may be true but dr nowitzki’s just a friend in fact i wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom
okay um let’s try this think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect
because there’s only one of me i’m more valuable
although amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me
let’s forget the toy thing okay um maybe…
penny look i appreciate your concern but i don’t think that’s what’s happening
all right what do you think is happening
i think dr nowitzki is a friendly colleague i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor and i need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill
don’t look at me like that i tried
uh breakfast yes lunch no i did have a cough drop but that really rides the line between sucking and eating
well perfect i made us sandwiches
mmm no big deal i enjoy spending time with you
and i with you question are you seeking a romantic relationship with me
well that would raise a number of problems we’re colleagues i’m currently in a relation… excuse me a moment
knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy will you marry me
